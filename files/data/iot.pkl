Please direct media inquiries to NTIA's Office of Public Affairs: (202) 482-7002; email: press@ntia.doc.gov . End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background: In March of 2015 the National Telecommunications and Information Administration issued a Request for Comment to identify substantive cybersecurity issues that affect the digital ecosystem and digital economic growth where broad consensus, coordinated action, and the development of best practices could substantially improve security for organizations and consumers. [ 1 ] We received comments from a range of stakeholders, including trade associations, large companies, cybersecurity startups, civil society organizations and independent computer security experts. [ 2 ] The comments recommended a diverse set of issues that might be addressed through the multistakeholder process, including cybersecurity policy and practice in the emerging area of Internet of Things (IoT). In a separate but related matter in April 2016, NTIA, the Department's Internet Policy Task Force, and its Digital Economy Leadership Team sought comments on the benefits, challenges, and potential roles for the government in fostering the advancement of the Internet of Things. [ 3 ] Over 130 stakeholders responded with comments addressing many substantive issues and Start Printed Page 64140 opportunities related to IoT. [ 4 ] Security was one of the most common topics raised. Many commenters emphasized the need for a secure lifecycle approach to IoT devices that considers the development, maintenance, and end-of-life phases and decisions for a device. On August 2, 2016, after reviewing these comments, NTIA announced that the next multistakeholder process on cybersecurity would be on IoT security upgradability and patching. [ 5 ] The matter of patching vulnerable systems is now an accepted part of cybersecurity. [ 6 ] Unaddressed technical flaws in systems leave the users of software and systems at risk. The nature of these risks varies, and mitigating these risks requires various efforts from the developers and owners of these systems. One of the more common means of mitigation is for the developer or other maintaining party to issue a security patch to address the vulnerability. Patching has become more commonly accepted, even for consumers, as more operating systems and applications shift to visible reminders and automated updates. Yet as one security expert notes, this evolution of the software industry has yet to become the dominant model in IoT. [ 7 ] To help realize the full innovative potential of IoT, users need reasonable assurance that connected devices, embedded systems, and their applications will be secure. A key part of that security is the mitigation of potential security vulnerabilities in IoT devices or applications through patching and security upgrades. The ultimate objective of the multistakeholder process is to foster a market offering more devices and systems that support security upgrades through increased consumer awareness and understanding. Enabling a thriving market for patchable IoT requires common definitions so that manufacturers and solution providers have shared visions for security, and consumers know what they are purchasing. Currently, no such common, widely accepted definitions exist, so many manufacturers struggle to effectively communicate to consumers the security features of their devices. This is detrimental to the digital ecosystem as a whole, as it does not reward companies that invest in patching and it prevents consumers from making informed purchasing choices. The immediate goal of this process will be to develop a broad, shared definition or set of definitions around security upgradability for consumer IoT, as well as strategies for communicating the security features of IoT devices to consumers. One initial step will be to explore and map out the many dimensions of security upgradability and patching for the relevant systems and applications. A goal will be to design and explore definitions that are easily understandable, while being backed by technical specifications and organizational practices and processes. A final step will be to develop a strategy to share these definitions throughout the broader development community, and ultimately with consumers. This may include raising awareness in the consumer space to help consumers understand security options and drive market forces. Stakeholders will determine the shape of the conversation and the process. NTIA has announced that the scope of the discussion will be around consumer devices, but stakeholders will ultimately determine which technologies, sectors, and applications will be discussed in the process, and covered by the resulting definitions and framework. While we anticipate a technical discussion in the process of exploring security upgrades, NTIA does not expect this discussion to develop new technical standards. This multistakeholder process is not a formal standards development process. Stakeholders may wish to use existing standards in their discussion and definitions, or may wish to call for new standards or standards processes as part of their recommendations. Stakeholders will determine the exact nature of the outcome of this process. Because it is unlikely that a one-size-fits-all solution will be feasible in this dynamic space, stakeholders will need to determine how to scope and organize the work through sub-groups or other means. Success of the process will be evaluated by the extent to which stakeholders embrace and implement the consensus findings within their individual practices or organizations, and work to promulgate them throughout the community. Although the stakeholders determine the outcome of the process, it is important to note that the process will not result in a new law or regulation. Matters to Be Considered: The October 19, 2016, meeting will be the first in a series of NTIA-convened multistakeholder discussions concerning IoT security upgradability and patching. Subsequent meetings will follow on a schedule determined by those participating in the first meeting. Stakeholders will engage in an open, transparent, consensus-driven process to understand the range of issues in security upgradability, and develop a set of definitions useful to both industry and consumers. The multistakeholder process will involve hearing and understanding the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, including a range of IoT manufacturers, solution providers, security experts, and consumer advocates. The October 19, 2016, meeting is intended to bring stakeholders together to share the range of views on security upgradability and patching, and to establish more concrete goals and structure of the process. The objectives of this first meeting are to: (1) Briefly review the importance of patching and the challenges in the existing ecosystem; (2) briefly share different perspectives on existing technologies and practices; (3) engage stakeholders in a discussion of key security upgrade dimensions, features, and concerns; (4) engage stakeholders in a discussion of logistical issues, including internal structures such as a small drafting committee or various working groups, and the location and frequency of future meetings; and (5) identify concrete goals and stakeholder work following the first meeting. The main objective of further meetings will be to encourage and facilitate continued discussion among stakeholders to build out a mapping of the range of issues, and develop a consensus view of a consolidated set of potential definitions. Discussions will also cover best practices for sharing security information with consumers. This discussion may include circulation of stakeholder-developed strawman drafts and discussion of the appropriate scope of the initiative. Stakeholders may also agree on procedural work plans for the group, including additional meetings or modified logistics for future meetings. NTIA suggests that stakeholders consider setting clear deadlines for a working draft and a phase for external review of this draft, Start Printed Page 64141 before reconvening to take account of external feedback.

S"Start Preamble Start Printed Page 51042 AGENCY: International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Availability of Privacy Shield Framework Documents. SUMMARY: The International Trade Administration (ITA) is publishing this notice to announce the availability of the Privacy Shield Framework documents. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and European Commission to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with European Union data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. The Privacy Shield Framework documents published in this notice include the Privacy Shield Principles and Annex I describing the new arbitral model available under the Privacy Shield, letters from the Secretary of Commerce and Acting Under Secretary for International Trade describing the Department of Commerce's administration of the Privacy Shield, letters from the Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission and Secretary of Transportation describing their enforcement of the Privacy Shield, a letter from the Secretary of State regarding the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson, two letters from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding safeguards and limitations applicable to U.S. national security authorities, and a letter from the Department of Justice regarding safeguards and limitations on U.S. Government access for law enforcement and public interest purposes. DATES: The Department of Commerce will begin accepting self-certifications to the Privacy Shield on August 1, 2016. Start Further Info FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shannon Coe, International Trade Administration, 202-482-6013 or Shannon.Coe@trade.gov . End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: July 7, 2016 Ms. Vra Jourov Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality European Commission Rue de la Loi/Westraat 200 1049 Brussels Belgium Dear Commissioner Jourov: On behalf of the United States, I am pleased to transmit herewith a package of EU-U.S. Privacy Shield materials that is the product of two years of productive discussions among our teams. This package, along with other materials available to the Commission from public sources, provides a very strong basis for a new adequacy finding by the European Commission. [ 1 ] We should both be proud of the improvements to the Framework. The Privacy Shield is based on Principles that have strong consensus support on both sides of the Atlantic, and we have strengthened their operation. Through our work together, we have the real opportunity to improve the protection of privacy around the world. The Privacy Shield Package includes the Privacy Shield Principles, along with a letter, attached as Annex 1, from the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce, which administers the program, describing the commitments that our Department has made to ensure that the Privacy Shield operates effectively. The Package also includes Annex 2, which includes other Department of Commerce commitments relating to the new arbitral model available under the Privacy Shield. I have directed my staff to devote all necessary resources to implement the Privacy Shield Framework expeditiously and fully and to ensure the commitments in Annex 1 and Annex 2 are met in a timely fashion. The Privacy Shield Package also includes other documents from other United States agencies, namely: A letter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) describing its enforcement of the Privacy Shield; A letter from the Department of Transportation describing its enforcement of the Privacy Shield; Two letters prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) regarding safeguards and limitations applicable to U.S. national security authorities; A letter from the Department of State and accompanying memorandum describing the State Department's commitment to establish a new Privacy Shield Ombudsperson for submission of inquiries regarding the United States' signals intelligence practices; and A letter prepared by the Department of Justice regarding safeguards and limitations on U.S. Government access for law enforcement and public interest purposes. You can be assured that the United States takes these commitments seriously. Within 30 days of final approval of the adequacy determination, the full Privacy Shield Package will be delivered to the Federal Register for publication. We look forward to working with you as the Privacy Shield is implemented and as we embark on the next phase of this process together. Sincerely, Penny Pritzker Annex 1: Letter From Acting Under Secretary for International Trade Ken Hyatt The Honorable Vra Jourov Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality European Commission Rue de la Loi/Westraat 200 1049 Brussels Belgium Dear Commissioner Jourov: On behalf of the International Trade Administration, I am pleased to describe the enhanced protection of personal data that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield or Framework) provides and the commitments the Department of Commerce (Department) has made to ensure that the Privacy Shield operates effectively. Finalizing this historic arrangement is a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. It offers confidence to EU individuals that their data will be protected and that they will have legal remedies to address any concerns. It offers certainty that will help grow the transatlantic economy by ensuring that thousands of European and American businesses can continue to invest and do business across our borders. The Privacy Shield is the result of over two years of hard work and collaboration with you, our colleagues in the European Commission (Commission). We look forward to continuing to work with the Commission to ensure that the Privacy Shield functions as intended. We have worked with the Commission to develop the Privacy Shield to allow organizations established in the United States to meet the adequacy requirements for data protection under EU law. The new Framework will yield several significant benefits for both individuals and businesses. First, it provides an important set of privacy protections for the data of EU individuals. It requires participating U.S. organizations to develop a conforming privacy policy, publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles so that the commitment becomes enforceable under U.S. law, annually re-certify their compliance to the Department, provide free independent dispute resolution to EU individuals, and be subject to the authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Transportation (DOT), or another enforcement agency. Second, the Privacy Shield will enable thousands of companies in the United States and subsidiaries of European companies in the United States to receive personal data from the European Union to facilitate data flows that support transatlantic trade. The transatlantic economic relationship is already the world's largest, accounting for half of global economic output and nearly one trillion dollars in goods and services trade, supporting millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Businesses that rely on transatlantic data flows come from all industry sectors and include major Fortune 500 firms as well as many small and Start Printed Page 51043 medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Transatlantic data flows allow U.S. organizations to process data required to offer goods, services, and employment opportunities to European individuals. The Privacy Shield supports shared privacy principles, bridging the differences in our legal approaches, while furthering trade and economic objectives of both Europe and the United States. While a company's decision to self-certify to this new Framework will be voluntary, once a company publicly commits to the Privacy Shield, its commitment is enforceable under U.S. law by either the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Transportation, depending on which authority has jurisdiction over the Privacy Shield organization. Enhancements Under the Privacy Shield Principles The resulting Privacy Shield strengthens the protection of privacy by: Requiring additional information be provided to individuals in the Notice Principle, including a declaration of the organization's participation in the Privacy Shield, a statement of the individual's right to access personal data, and the identification of the relevant independent dispute resolution body; strengthening protection of personal data that is transferred from a Privacy Shield organization to a third party controller by requiring the parties to enter into a contract that provides that such data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and that the recipient will provide the same level of protection as the Principles; strengthening protection of personal data that is transferred from a Privacy Shield organization to a third party agent, including by requiring a Privacy Shield organization to: take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization's obligations under the Principles; upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department upon request; providing that a Privacy Shield organization is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf, and that the Privacy Shield organization shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage; clarifying that Privacy Shield organizations must limit personal information to the information that is relevant for the purposes of processing; requiring an organization to annually certify with the Department its commitment to apply the Principles to information it received while it participated in the Privacy Shield if it leaves the Privacy Shield and chooses to keep such data; requiring that independent recourse mechanisms be provided at no cost to the individual; requiring organizations and their selected independent recourse mechanisms to respond promptly to inquiries and requests by the Department for information relating to the Privacy Shield; requiring organizations to respond expeditiously to complaints regarding compliance with the Principles referred by EU Member State authorities through the Department; and requiring a Privacy Shield organization to make public any relevant Privacy Shield-related sections of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC if it becomes subject to an FTC or court order based on non-compliance. Administration and Supervision of the Privacy Shield Program by the Department of Commerce The Department reiterates its commitment to maintain and make available to the public an authoritative list of U.S. organizations that have self-certified to the Department and declared their commitment to adhere to the Principles (the Privacy Shield List). The Department will keep the Privacy Shield List up to date by removing organizations when they voluntarily withdraw, fail to complete the annual re-certification in accordance with the Department's procedures, or are found to persistently fail to comply. The Department will also maintain and make available to the public an authoritative record of U.S. organizations that had previously self-certified to the Department, but that have been removed from the Privacy Shield List, including those that were removed for persistent failure to comply with the Principles. The Department will identify the reason each organization was removed. In addition, the Department commits to strengthening the administration and supervision of the Privacy Shield. Specifically, the Department will: Provide Additional Information on the Privacy Shield Web Site Maintain the Privacy Shield List, as well as a record of those organizations that previously self-certified their adherence to the Principles, but which are no longer assured of the benefits of the Privacy Shield; include a prominently placed explanation clarifying that all organizations removed from the Privacy Shield List are no longer assured of the benefits of the Privacy Shield, but must nevertheless continue to apply the Principles to the personal information that they received while they participated in the Privacy Shield for as long as they retain such information; and provide a link to the list of Privacy Shield-related FTC cases maintained on the FTC Web site. Verify Self-Certification Requirements Prior to finalizing an organization's self-certification (or annual re-certification) and placing an organization on the Privacy Shield List, verify that the organization has:  Provided required organization contact information;  described the activities of the organization with respect to personal information received from the EU;  indicated what personal information is covered by its self-certification;  if the organization has a public Web site, provided the web address where the privacy policy is available and the privacy policy is accessible at the web address provided, or if an organization does not have a public Web site, provided where the privacy policy is available for viewing by the public;  included in its relevant privacy policy a statement that it adheres to the Principles and if the privacy policy is available online, a hyperlink to the Department's Privacy Shield Web site;  identified the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against the organization regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the Principles or a future annex to the Principles);  if the organization elects to satisfy the requirements in points (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle by committing to cooperate with the appropriate EU data protection authorities (DPAs), indicated its intention to cooperate with DPAs in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Privacy Shield, notably to respond to their inquiries when EU data subjects have brought their complaints directly to their national DPAs;  identified any privacy program in which the organization is a member;  identified the method of verification of assuring compliance with the Principles ( e.g., in-house, third party);  identified, both in its self-certification submission and in its privacy policy, the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate and resolve complaints;  included in its relevant privacy policy, if the policy is available online, a hyperlink to the Web site or complaint submission form of the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved complaints; and  if the organization has indicated that it intends to receive human resources information transferred from the EU for use in the context of the employment relationship, declared its commitment to cooperate and comply with DPAs to resolve complaints concerning its activities with regard to such data, provided the Department with a copy of its human resources privacy policy, and provided where the privacy policy is available for viewing by its affected employees. work with independent recourse mechanisms to verify that the organizations have in fact registered with the relevant mechanism indicated in their self-certification submissions, where such registration is required. Expand Efforts To Follow Up With Organizations That Have Been Removed From the Privacy Shield List notify organizations that are removed from the Privacy Shield List for persistent failure to comply that they are not entitled Start Printed Page 51044 to retain information collected under the Privacy Shield; and send questionnaires to organizations whose self-certifications lapse or who have voluntarily withdrawn from the Privacy Shield to verify whether the organization will return, delete, or continue to apply the Principles to the personal information that they received while they participated in the Privacy Shield, and if personal information will be retained, verify who within the organization will serve as an ongoing point of contact for Privacy Shield-related questions. Search for and Address False Claims of Participation Review the privacy policies of organizations that have previously participated in the Privacy Shield program, but that have been removed from the Privacy Shield List to identify any false claims of Privacy Shield participation; on an ongoing basis, when an organization: (a) Withdraws from participation in the Privacy Shield, (b) fails to recertify its adherence to the Principles, or (c) is removed as a participant in the Privacy Shield notably for persistent failure to comply, undertake, on an ex officio basis, to verify that the organization has removed from any relevant published privacy policy any references to the Privacy Shield that imply that the organization continues to actively participate in the Privacy Shield and is entitled to its benefits. Where the Department finds that such references have not been removed, the Department will warn the organization that the Department will, as appropriate, refer matters to the relevant agency for potential enforcement action if it continues to make the claim of Privacy Shield certification. If the organization neither removes the references nor self-certifies its compliance under the Privacy Shield, the Department will ex officio refer the matter to the FTC, DOT, or other appropriate enforcement agency or, in appropriate cases, take action to enforce the Privacy Shield certification mark; undertake other efforts to identify false claims of Privacy Shield participation and improper use of the Privacy Shield certification mark, including by conducting Internet searches to identify where images of the Privacy Shield certification mark are being displayed and references to Privacy Shield in organizations' privacy policies; promptly address any issues that we identify during our ex officio monitoring of false claims of participation and misuse of the certification mark, including warning organizations misrepresenting their participation in the Privacy Shield program as described above; take other appropriate corrective action, including pursuing any legal recourse the Department is authorized to take and referring matters to the FTC, DOT, or another appropriate enforcement agency; and promptly review and address complaints about false claims of participation that we receive. The Department will undertake reviews of privacy policies of organizations to more effectively identify and address false claims of Privacy Shield participation. Specifically, the Department will review the privacy policies of organizations whose self-certification has lapsed due to their failure to re-certify adherence to the Principles. The Department will conduct this type of review to verify that such organizations have removed from any relevant published privacy policy any references that imply that the organizations continue to actively participate in the Privacy Shield. As a result of these types of reviews, we will identify organizations that have not removed such references and send those organizations a letter from the Department's Office of General Counsel warning of potential enforcement action if the references are not removed. The Department will take follow-up action to ensure that the organizations either remove the inappropriate references or re-certify their adherence to the Principles. In addition, the Department will undertake efforts to identify false claims of Privacy Shield participation by organizations that have never participated in the Privacy Shield program, and will take similar corrective action with respect to such organizations. Conduct Periodic ex officio Compliance Reviews and Assessments of the Program On an ongoing basis, monitor effective compliance, including through sending detailed questionnaires to participating organizations, to identify issues that may warrant further follow-up action. In particular, such compliance reviews shall take place when: (a) The Department has received specific non-frivolous complaints about an organization's compliance with the Principles, (b) an organization does not respond satisfactorily to inquiries by the Department for information relating to the Privacy Shield, or (c) there is credible evidence that an organization does not comply with its commitments under the Privacy Shield. The Department shall, when appropriate, consult with the competent data protection authorities about such compliance reviews; and assess periodically the administration and supervision of the Privacy Shield program to ensure that monitoring efforts are appropriate to address new issues as they arise. The Department has increased the resources that will be devoted to the administration and supervision of the Privacy Shield program, including doubling the number of staff responsible for the administration and supervision of the program. We will continue to dedicate appropriate resources to such efforts to ensure effective monitoring and administration of the program. Tailor the Privacy Shield Web Site to Targeted Audiences The Department will tailor the Privacy Shield Web site to focus on three target audiences: EU individuals, EU businesses, and U.S. businesses. The inclusion of material targeted directly to EU individuals and EU businesses will facilitate transparency in a number of ways. With regard to EU individuals, it will clearly explain: (1) The rights the Privacy Shield provides to EU individuals; (2) the recourse mechanisms available to EU individuals when they believe an organization has breached its commitment to comply with the Principles; and (3) how to find information pertaining to an organization's Privacy Shield self-certification. With regard to EU businesses, it will facilitate verification of: (1) Whether an organization is assured of the benefits of the Privacy Shield; (2) the type of information covered by an organization's Privacy Shield self-certification; (3) the privacy policy that applies to the covered information; and (4) the method the organization uses to verify its adherence to the Principles. Increase Cooperation With DPAs To increase opportunities for cooperation with DPAs, the Department will establish a dedicated contact at the Department to act as a liaison with DPAs. In instances where a DPA believes that an organization is not complying with the Principles, including following a complaint from an EU individual, the DPA can reach out to the dedicated contact at the Department to refer the organization for further review. The contact will also receive referrals regarding organizations that falsely claim to participate in the Privacy Shield, despite never having self-certified their adherence to the Principles. The contact will assist DPAs seeking information related to a specific organization's self-certification or previous participation in the program, and the contact will respond to DPA inquiries regarding the implementation of specific Privacy Shield requirements. Second, the Department will provide DPAs with material regarding the Privacy Shield for inclusion on their own Web sites to increase transparency for EU individuals and EU businesses. Increased awareness regarding the Privacy Shield and the rights and responsibilities it creates should facilitate the identification of issues as they arise, so that these can be appropriately addressed. Facilitate Resolution of Complaints About Non-Compliance The Department, through the dedicated contact, will receive complaints referred to the Department by a DPA that a Privacy Shield organization is not complying with the Principles. The Department will make its best effort to facilitate resolution of the complaint with the Privacy Shield organization. Within 90 days after receipt of the complaint, the Department will provide an update to the DPA. To facilitate the submission of such complaints, the Department will create a standard form for DPAs to submit to the Department's dedicated contact. The dedicated contact will track all referrals from DPAs received by the Department, and the Department will provide in the annual review described below a report analyzing in aggregate the complaints it receives each year. Adopt Arbitral Procedures and Select Arbitrators in Consultation With the Commission The Department will fulfill its commitments under Annex I and publish the procedures after agreement has been reached. Start Printed Page 51045 Joint Review Mechanism of the Functioning of the Privacy Shield The Department of Commerce, the FTC, and other agencies, as appropriate, will hold annual meetings with the Commission, interested DPAs, and appropriate representatives from the Article 29 Working Party, where the Department will provide updates on the Privacy Shield program. The annual meetings will include discussion of current issues related to the functioning, implementation, supervision, and enforcement of the Privacy Shield, including referrals received by the Department from DPAs, the results of ex officio compliance reviews, and may also include discussion of relevant changes of law. The first annual review and subsequent reviews as appropriate will include a dialogue on other topics, such as in the area of automated decision-making, including aspects relating to similarities and differences in approaches in the EU and the US. Update of Laws The Department will make reasonable efforts to inform the Commission of material developments in the law in the United States so far as they are relevant to the Privacy Shield in the field of data privacy protection and the limitations and safeguards applicable to access to personal data by U.S. authorities and its subsequent use. National Security Exception With respect to the limitations to the adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles for national security purposes, the General Counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Robert Litt, has also sent two letters addressed to Justin Antonipillai and Ted Dean of the Department of Commerce, and these have been forwarded to you. These letters extensively discuss, among other things, the policies, safeguards, and limitations that apply to signals intelligence activities conducted by the U.S. In addition, these letters describe the transparency provided by the Intelligence Community about these matters. As the Commission is assessing the Privacy Shield Framework, the information in these letters provides assurance to conclude that the Privacy Shield will operate appropriately, in accordance with the Principles therein. We understand that you may raise information that has been released publicly by the Intelligence Community, along with other information, in the future to inform the annual review of the Privacy Shield Framework. On the basis of the Privacy Shield Principles and the accompanying letters and materials, including the Department's commitments regarding the administration and supervision of the Privacy Shield Framework, our expectation is that the Commission will determine that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework provides adequate protection for the purposes of EU law and data transfers from the European Union will continue to organizations that participate in the Privacy Shield. Sincerely, Ken Hyatt Annex 2: Arbitral Model Annex I This Annex I provides the terms under which Privacy Shield organizations are obligated to arbitrate claims, pursuant to the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle. The binding arbitration option described below applies to certain residual claims as to data covered by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The purpose of this option is to provide a prompt, independent, and fair mechanism, at the option of individuals, for resolution of claimed violations of the Principles not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms, if any. A. Scope This arbitration option is available to an individual to determine, for residual claims, whether a Privacy Shield organization has violated its obligations under the Principles as to that individual, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available only for these purposes. This option is not available, for example, with respect to the exceptions to the Principles [ 1 ] or with respect to an allegation about the adequacy of the Privacy Shield. B. Available Remedies Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel (consisting of one or three arbitrators, as agreed by the parties) has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return of the individual's data in question) necessary to remedy the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual. These are the only powers of the arbitration panel with respect to remedies. In considering remedies, the arbitration panel is required to consider other remedies that already have been imposed by other mechanisms under the Privacy Shield. No damages, costs, fees, or other remedies are available. Each party bears its own attorney's fees. C. Pre-Arbitration Requirements An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) Raise the claimed violation directly with the organization and afford the organization an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the individual. This arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual's same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties. In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU Data Protection Authority (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation directly with the organization. A DPA's authority to resolve the same claim against an EU data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA authority. D. Binding Nature of Decisions An individual's decision to invoke this binding arbitration option is entirely voluntary. Arbitral decisions will be binding on all parties to the arbitration. Once invoked, the individual forgoes the option to seek relief for the same claimed violation in another forum, except that if non-monetary equitable relief does not fully remedy the claimed violation, the individual's invocation of arbitration will not preclude a claim for damages that is otherwise available in the courts. E. Review and Enforcement Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to seek judicial review and enforcement of the arbitral decisions pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act. [ 2 ] Any such cases Start Printed Page 51046 must be brought in the federal district court whose territorial coverage includes the primary place of business of the Privacy Shield organization. This arbitration option is intended to resolve individual disputes, and arbitral decisions are not intended to function as persuasive or binding precedent in matters involving other parties, including in future arbitrations or in EU or U.S. courts, or FTC proceedings. F. The Arbitration Panel The parties will select the arbitrators from the list of arbitrators discussed below. Consistent with applicable law, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission will develop a list of at least 20 arbitrators, chosen on the basis of independence, integrity, and expertise. The following shall apply in connection with this process: Arbitrators: (1) Will remain on the list for a period of 3 years, absent exceptional circumstances or for cause, renewable for one additional period of 3 years; (2) shall not be subject to any instructions from, or be affiliated with, either party, or any Privacy Shield organization, or the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental authority, public authority, or enforcement authority; and (3) must be admitted to practice law in the U.S. and be experts in U.S. privacy law, with expertise in EU data protection law. G. Arbitration Procedures Consistent with applicable law, within 6 months from the adoption of the adequacy decision, the Department of Commerce and the European Commission will agree to adopt an existing, well-established set of U.S. arbitral procedures (such as AAA or JAMS) to govern proceedings before the Privacy Shield Panel, subject to each of the following considerations: 1. An individual may initiate binding arbitration, subject to the pre-arbitration requirements provision above, by delivering a Notice to the organization. The Notice shall contain a summary of steps taken under Paragraph C to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim. 2. Procedures will be developed to ensure that an individual's same claimed violation does not receive duplicative remedies or procedures. 3. FTC action may proceed in parallel with arbitration. 4. No representative of the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental authority, public authority, or enforcement authority may participate in these arbitrations, provided, that at the request of an EU individual, EU DPAs may provide assistance in the preparation only of the Notice but EU DPAs may not have access to discovery or any other materials related to these arbitrations. 5. The location of the arbitration will be the United States, and the individual may choose video or telephone participation, which will be provided at no cost to the individual. In-person participation will not be required. 6. The language of the arbitration will be English unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Upon a reasoned request, and taking into account whether the individual is represented by an attorney, interpretation at the arbitral hearing as well as translation of arbitral materials will be provided at no cost to the individual, unless the panel finds that, under the circumstances of the specific arbitration, this would lead to unjustified or disproportionate costs. 7. Materials submitted to arbitrators will be treated confidentially and will only be used in connection with the arbitration. 8. Individual-specific discovery may be permitted if necessary, and such discovery will be treated confidentially by the parties and will only be used in connection with the arbitration. 9. Arbitrations should be completed within 90 days of the delivery of the Notice to the organization at issue, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. H. Costs Arbitrators should take reasonable steps to minimize the costs or fees of the arbitrations. Subject to applicable law, the Department of Commerce will facilitate the establishment of a fund, into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay an annual contribution, based in part on the size of the organization, which will cover the arbitral cost, including arbitrator fees, up to maximum amounts (caps), in consultation with the European Commission. The fund will be managed by a third party, which will report regularly on the operations of the fund. At the annual review, the Department of Commerce and European Commission will review the operation of the fund, including the need to adjust the amount of the contributions or of the caps, and will consider, among other things, the number of arbitrations and the costs and timing of the arbitrations, with the mutual understanding that there will be no excessive financial burden imposed on Privacy Shield organizations. Attorney's fees are not covered by this provision or any fund under this provision. EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles Issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce I. Overview 1. While the United States and the European Union share the goal of enhancing privacy protection, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by the European Union. The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. Given those differences and to provide organizations in the United States with a reliable mechanism for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union while ensuring that EU data subjects continue to benefit from effective safeguards and protection as required by European legislation with respect to the processing of their personal data when they have been transferred to non-EU countries, the Department of Commerce is issuing these Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental Principles (collectively the Principles) under its statutory authority to foster, promote, and develop international commerce ( 15 U.S.C. 1512 ). The Principles were developed in consultation with the European Commission, and with industry and other stakeholders, to facilitate trade and commerce between the United States and European Union. They are intended for use solely by organizations in the United States receiving personal data from the European Union for the purpose of qualifying for the Privacy Shield and thus benefitting from the European Commission's adequacy decision. [ 1 ] The Principles do not affect the application of national provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC (the Directive) that apply to the processing of personal data in the Member States. Nor do the Principles limit privacy obligations that otherwise apply under U.S. law. 2. In order to rely on the Privacy Shield to effectuate transfers of personal data from the EU, an organization must self-certify its adherence to the Principles to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) (the Department). While decisions by organizations to thus enter the Privacy Shield are entirely voluntary, effective compliance is compulsory: Organizations that self-certify to the Department and publicly declare their commitment to adhere to the Principles must comply fully with the Principles. In order to enter the Privacy Shield, an organization must (a) be subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), the Department of Transportation or  another statutory body that will effectively ensure compliance with the Principles (other U.S. statutory bodies recognized by the EU may be included as an annex in the future) ; (b) publicly declare its commitment to comply with the Principles; (c) publicly disclose its privacy policies in line with these Principles; and (d) fully implement them. An organization's failure to comply is enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts in or affecting commerce ( 15 U.S.C. 45 (a)) or other laws or regulations prohibiting such acts. 3. The Department of Commerce will maintain and make available to the public an authoritative list of U.S. organizations that have self-certified to the Department and declared their commitment to adhere to the Principles (the Privacy Shield List). Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the Start Printed Page 51047 date that the Department places the organization on the Privacy Shield List. The Department will remove an organization from the Privacy Shield List if it voluntarily withdraws from the Privacy Shield or if it fails to complete its annual re-certification to the Department. An organization's removal from the Privacy Shield List means it may no longer benefit from the European Commission's adequacy decision to receive personal information from the EU. The organization must continue to apply the Principles to the personal information it received while it participated in the Privacy Shield, and affirm to the Department on an annual basis its commitment to do so, for as long as it retains such information; otherwise, the organization must return or delete the information or provide adequate protection for the information by another authorized means. The Department will also remove from the Privacy Shield List those organizations that have persistently failed to comply with the Principles; these organizations do not qualify for Privacy Shield benefits and must return or delete the personal information they received under the Privacy Shield. 4. The Department will also maintain and make available to the public an authoritative record of U.S. organizations that had previously self-certified to the Department, but that have been removed from the Privacy Shield List. The Department will provide a clear warning that these organizations are not participants in the Privacy Shield; that removal from the Privacy Shield List means that such organizations cannot claim to be Privacy Shield compliant and must avoid any statements or misleading practices implying that they participate in the Privacy Shield; and that such organizations are no longer entitled to benefit from the European Commission's adequacy decision that would enable those organizations to receive personal information from the EU. An organization that continues to claim participation in the Privacy Shield or makes other Privacy Shield-related misrepresentations after it has been removed from the Privacy Shield List may be subject to enforcement action by the FTC, the Department of Transportation, or other enforcement authorities. 5. Adherence to these Principles may be limited: (a) To the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements; (b) by statute, government regulation, or case law that creates conflicting obligations or explicit authorizations, provided that, in exercising any such authorization, an organization can demonstrate that its non-compliance with the Principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests furthered by such authorization; or (c) if the effect of the Directive or Member State law is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided such exceptions or derogations are applied in comparable contexts. Consistent with the goal of enhancing privacy protection, organizations should strive to implement these Principles fully and transparently, including indicating in their privacy policies where exceptions to the Principles permitted by (b) above will apply on a regular basis. For the same reason, where the option is allowable under the Principles and/or U.S. law, organizations are expected to opt for the higher protection where possible. 6. Organizations are obligated to apply the Principles to all personal data transferred in reliance on the Privacy Shield after they enter the Privacy Shield. An organization that chooses to extend Privacy Shield benefits to human resources personal information transferred from the EU for use in the context of an employment relationship must indicate this when it self-certifies to the Department and conform to the requirements set forth in the Supplemental Principle on Self-Certification. 7. U.S. law will apply to questions of interpretation and compliance with the Principles and relevant privacy policies by Privacy Shield organizations, except where such organizations have committed to cooperate with European data protection authorities (DPAs). Unless otherwise stated, all provisions of the Principles apply where they are relevant. 8. Definitions: a. Personal data and personal information are data about an identified or identifiable individual that are within the scope of the Directive, received by an organization in the United States from the European Union, and recorded in any form. b. Processing of personal data means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure or dissemination, and erasure or destruction. c. Controller means a person or organization which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. 9. The effective date of the Principles is the date of final approval of the European Commission's adequacy determination. II. Principles 1. Notice a. An organization must inform individuals about: i. Its participation in the Privacy Shield and provide a link to, or the web address for, the Privacy Shield List, ii. the types of personal data collected and, where applicable, the entities or subsidiaries of the organization also adhering to the Principles, iii. its commitment to subject to the Principles all personal data received from the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield, iv. the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them, v. how to contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, including any relevant establishment in the EU that can respond to such inquiries or complaints, vi. the type or identity of third parties to which it discloses personal information, and the purposes for which it does so, vii. the right of individuals to access their personal data, viii. the choices and means the organization offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data, ix. the independent dispute resolution body designated to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to the individual, and whether it is: (1) The panel established by DPAs, (2) an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the EU, or (3) an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States, x. being subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC, the Department of Transportation or any other U.S. authorized statutory body, xi. the possibility, under certain conditions, for the individual to invoke binding arbitration, xii. the requirement to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, and xiii. its liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties. b. This notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to the organization or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any event before the organization uses such information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by the transferring organization or discloses it for the first time to a third party. 2. Choice a. An organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party or (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individuals. Individuals must be provided with clear, conspicuous, and readily available mechanisms to exercise choice. b. By derogation to the previous paragraph, it is not necessary to provide choice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of the organization. However, an organization shall always enter into a contract with the agent. c. For sensitive information ( i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual), organizations must obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) from individuals if such information is to be (i) disclosed to a third party or (ii) used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individuals through the exercise of opt-in choice. In addition, an organization should treat as sensitive any personal information received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive. 3. Accountability for Onward Transfer a. To transfer personal information to a third party acting as a controller, organizations must comply with the Notice and Choice Principles. Organizations must also enter into a contract with the third-party controller that provides that such data may Start Printed Page 51048 only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and that the recipient will provide the same level of protection as the Principles and will notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. The contract shall provide that when such a determination is made the third party controller ceases processing or takes other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate. b. To transfer personal data to a third party acting as an agent, organizations must: (i) Transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization's obligations under the Principles; (iv) require the agent to notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department upon request. 4. Security a. Organizations creating, maintaining, using or disseminating personal information must take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data. 5. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation a. Consistent with the Principles, personal information must be limited to the information that is relevant for the purposes of processing. [ 2 ] An organization may not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, an organization must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. An organization must adhere to the Principles for as long as it retains such information. b. Information may be retained in a form identifying or making identifiable [ 3 ] the individual only for as long as it serves a purpose of processing within the meaning of 5a. This obligation does not prevent organizations from processing personal information for longer periods for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research, and statistical analysis. In these cases, such processing shall be subject to the other Principles and provisions of the Framework. Organizations should take reasonable and appropriate measures in complying with this provision. 6. Access a. Individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. 7. Recourse, Enforcement and Liability a. Effective privacy protection must include robust mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Principles, recourse for individuals who are affected by non-compliance with the Principles, and consequences for the organization when the Principles are not followed. At a minimum such mechanisms must include: i. Readily available independent recourse mechanisms by which each individual's complaints and disputes are investigated and expeditiously resolved at no cost to the individual and by reference to the Principles, and damages awarded where the applicable law or private-sector initiatives so provide; ii. follow-up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions organizations make about their privacy practices are true and that privacy practices have been implemented as presented and, in particular, with regard to cases of non-compliance; and iii. obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles by organizations announcing their adherence to them and consequences for such organizations. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by organizations. b. Organizations and their selected independent recourse mechanisms will respond promptly to inquiries and requests by the Department for information relating to the Privacy Shield. All organizations must respond expeditiously to complaints regarding compliance with the Principles referred by EU Member State authorities through the Department. Organizations that have chosen to cooperate with DPAs, including organizations that process human resources data, must respond directly to such authorities with regard to the investigation and resolution of complaints. c. Organizations are obligated to arbitrate claims and follow the terms as set forth in Annex I, provided that an individual has invoked binding arbitration by delivering notice to the organization at issue and following the procedures and subject to conditions set forth in Annex I. d. In the context of an onward transfer, a Privacy Shield organization has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. The Privacy Shield organization shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. e. When an organization becomes subject to an FTC or court order based on non-compliance, the organization shall make public any relevant Privacy Shield-related sections of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC, to the extent consistent with confidentiality requirements. The Department has established a dedicated point of contact for DPAs for any problems of compliance by Privacy Shield organizations. The FTC will give priority consideration to referrals of non-compliance with the Principles from the Department and EU Member State authorities, and will exchange information regarding referrals with the referring state authorities on a timely basis, subject to existing confidentiality restrictions. III. Supplemental Principles 1. Sensitive Data a. An organization is not required to obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) with respect to sensitive data where the processing is: i. In the vital interests of the data subject or another person; ii. necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses; iii. required to provide medical care or diagnosis; iv. carried out in the course of legitimate activities by a foundation, association or any other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to the persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without the consent of the data subjects; v. necessary to carry out the organization's obligations in the field of employment law; or vi. related to data that are manifestly made public by the individual. 2. Journalistic Exceptions a. Given U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of the press and the Directive's exemption for journalistic material, where the rights of a free press embodied in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution intersect with privacy protection interests, the First Amendment must govern the balancing of these interests with regard to the activities of U.S. persons or organizations. Start Printed Page 51049 b. Personal information that is gathered for publication, broadcast, or other forms of public communication of journalistic material, whether used or not, as well as information found in previously published material disseminated from media archives, is not subject to the requirements of the Privacy Shield Principles. 3. Secondary Liability a. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), telecommunications carriers, and other organizations are not liable under the Privacy Shield Principles when on behalf of another organization they merely transmit, route, switch, or cache information. As is the case with the Directive itself, the Privacy Shield does not create secondary liability. To the extent that an organization is acting as a mere conduit for data transmitted by third parties and does not determine the purposes and means of processing those personal data, it would not be liable. 4. Performing Due Diligence and Conducting Audits a. The activities of auditors and investment bankers may involve processing personal data without the consent or knowledge of the individual. This is permitted by the Notice, Choice, and Access Principles under the circumstances described below. b. Public stock corporations and closely held companies, including Privacy Shield organizations, are regularly subject to audits. Such audits, particularly those looking into potential wrongdoing, may be jeopardized if disclosed prematurely. Similarly, a Privacy Shield organization involved in a potential merger or takeover will need to perform, or be the subject of, a due diligence review. This will often entail the collection and processing of personal data, such as information on senior executives and other key personnel. Premature disclosure could impede the transaction or even violate applicable securities regulation. Investment bankers and attorneys engaged in due diligence, or auditors conducting an audit, may process information without knowledge of the individual only to the extent and for the period necessary to meet statutory or public interest requirements and in other circumstances in which the application of these Principles would prejudice the legitimate interests of the organization. These legitimate interests include the monitoring of organizations' compliance with their legal obligations and legitimate accounting activities, and the need for confidentiality connected with possible acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or other similar transactions carried out by investment bankers or auditors. 5. The Role of the Data Protection Authorities a. Organizations will implement their commitment to cooperate with European Union data protection authorities (DPAs) as described below. Under the Privacy Shield, U.S. organizations receiving personal data from the EU must commit to employ effective mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. More specifically as set out in the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle, participating organizations must provide: (a)(i) Recourse for individuals to whom the data relate; (a)(ii) follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they have made about their privacy practices are true; and (a)(iii) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles and consequences for such organizations. An organization may satisfy points (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle if it adheres to the requirements set forth here for cooperating with the DPAs. b. An organization commits to cooperate with the DPAs by declaring in its Privacy Shield self-certification submission to the Department of Commerce ( see Supplemental Principle on Self-Certification) that the organization: i. Elects to satisfy the requirement in points (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of the Privacy Shield Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle by committing to cooperate with the DPAs; ii. will cooperate with the DPAs in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Privacy Shield; and iii. will comply with any advice given by the DPAs where the DPAs take the view that the organization needs to take specific action to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non-compliance with the Principles, and will provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken. c. Operation of DPA Panels i. The cooperation of the DPAs will be provided in the form of information and advice in the following way: 1. The advice of the DPAs will be delivered through an informal panel of DPAs established at the European Union level, which will inter alia help ensure a harmonized and coherent approach. 2. The panel will provide advice to the U.S. organizations concerned on unresolved complaints from individuals about the handling of personal information that has been transferred from the EU under the Privacy Shield. This advice will be designed to ensure that the Privacy Shield Principles are being correctly applied and will include any remedies for the individual(s) concerned that the DPAs consider appropriate. 3. The panel will provide such advice in response to referrals from the organizations concerned and/or to complaints received directly from individuals against organizations which have committed to cooperate with DPAs for Privacy Shield purposes, while encouraging and if necessary helping such individuals in the first instance to use the in-house complaint handling arrangements that the organization may offer. 4. Advice will be issued only after both sides in a dispute have had a reasonable opportunity to comment and to provide any evidence they wish. The panel will seek to deliver advice as quickly as this requirement for due process allows. As a general rule, the panel will aim to provide advice within 60 days after receiving a complaint or referral and more quickly where possible. 5. The panel will make public the results of its consideration of complaints submitted to it, if it sees fit. 6. The delivery of advice through the panel will not give rise to any liability for the panel or for individual DPAs. ii. As noted above, organizations choosing this option for dispute resolution must undertake to comply with the advice of the DPAs. If an organization fails to comply within 25 days of the delivery of the advice and has offered no satisfactory explanation for the delay, the panel will give notice of its intention either to refer the matter to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Transportation, or other U.S. federal or state body with statutory powers to take enforcement action in cases of deception or misrepresentation, or to conclude that the agreement to cooperate has been seriously breached and must therefore be considered null and void. In the latter case, the panel will inform the Department of Commerce so that the Privacy Shield List can be duly amended. Any failure to fulfill the undertaking to cooperate with the DPAs, as well as failures to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, will be actionable as a deceptive practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act or other similar statute. d. An organization that wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship must commit to cooperate with the DPAs with regard to such data ( see Supplemental Principle on Human Resources Data). e. Organizations choosing this option will be required to pay an annual fee which will be designed to cover the operating costs of the panel, and they may additionally be asked to meet any necessary translation expenses arising out of the panel's consideration of referrals or complaints against them. The annual fee will not exceed USD 500 and will be less for smaller companies. 6. Self-Certification a. Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the date on which the Department has placed the organization's self-certification submission on the Privacy Shield List after having determined that the submission is complete. b. To self-certify for the Privacy Shield, an organization must provide to the Department a self-certification submission, signed by a corporate officer on behalf of the organization that is joining the Privacy Shield, that contains at least the following information: i. Name of organization, mailing address, email address, telephone, and fax numbers; ii. description of the activities of the organization with respect to personal information received from the EU; and iii. description of the organization's privacy policy for such personal information, including: 1. If the organization has a public Web site, the relevant web address where the privacy policy is available, or if the organization does not have a public Web site, where the privacy policy is available for viewing by the public; 2. its effective date of implementation; Start Printed Page 51050 3. a contact office for the handling of complaints, access requests, and any other issues arising under the Privacy Shield; 4. the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against the organization regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the Principles or a future annex to the Principles); 5. name of any privacy program in which the organization is a member; 6. method of verification ( e.g., in-house, third party) ( see Supplemental Principle on Verification; and 7. the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved complaints. c. Where the organization wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources information transferred from the EU for use in the context of the employment relationship, it may do so where a statutory body listed in the Principles or a future annex to the Principles has jurisdiction to hear claims against the organization arising out of the processing of human resources information. In addition, the organization must indicate this in its self-certification submission and declare its commitment to cooperate with the EU authority or authorities concerned in conformity with the Supplemental Principles on Human Resources Data and the Role of the Data Protection Authorities as applicable and that it will comply with the advice given by such authorities. The organization must also provide the Department with a copy of its human resources privacy policy and provide information where the privacy policy is available for viewing by its affected employees. d. The Department will maintain the Privacy Shield List of organizations that file completed self-certification submissions, thereby assuring the availability of Privacy Shield benefits, and will update such list on the basis of annual self-recertification submissions and notifications received pursuant to the Supplemental Principle on Dispute Resolution and Enforcement. Such self-certification submissions must be provided not less than annually; otherwise the organization will be removed from the Privacy Shield List and Privacy Shield benefits will no longer be assured. Both the Privacy Shield List and the self-certification submissions by the organizations will be made publicly available. All organizations that are placed on the Privacy Shield List by the Department must also state in their relevant published privacy policy statements that they adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If available online, an organization's privacy policy must include a hyperlink to the Department's Privacy Shield Web site and a hyperlink to the Web site or complaint submission form of the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved complaints. e. The Privacy Principles apply immediately upon certification. Recognizing that the Principles will impact commercial relationships with third parties, organizations that certify to the Privacy Shield Framework in the first two months following the Framework's effective date shall bring existing commercial relationships with third parties into conformity with the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle as soon as possible, and in any event no later than nine months from the date upon which they certify to the Privacy Shield. During that interim period, where organizations transfer data to a third party, they shall (i) apply the Notice and Choice Principles, and (ii) where personal data is transferred to a third party acting as an agent, ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Principles. f. An organization must subject to the Privacy Shield Principles all personal data received from the EU in reliance upon the Privacy Shield. The undertaking to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles is not time-limited in respect of personal data received during the period in which the organization enjoys the benefits of the Privacy Shield. Its undertaking means that it will continue to apply the Principles to such data for as long as the organization stores, uses or discloses them, even if it subsequently leaves the Privacy Shield for any reason. An organization that withdraws from the Privacy Shield but wants to retain such data must affirm to the Department on an annual basis its commitment to continue to apply the Principles or provide adequate protection for the information by another authorized means (for example, using a contract that fully reflects the requirements of the relevant standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission); otherwise, the organization must return or delete the information. An organization that withdraws from the Privacy Shield must remove from any relevant privacy policy any references to the Privacy Shield that imply that the organization continues to actively participate in the Privacy Shield and is entitled to its benefits. g. An organization that will cease to exist as a separate legal entity as a result of a merger or a takeover must notify the Department of this in advance. The notification should also indicate whether the acquiring entity or the entity resulting from the merger will (i) continue to be bound by the Privacy Shield Principles by the operation of law governing the takeover or merger or (ii) elect to self-certify its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles or put in place other safeguards, such as a written agreement that will ensure adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. Where neither (i) nor (ii) applies, any personal data that has been acquired under the Privacy Shield must be promptly deleted. h. When an organization leaves the Privacy Shield for any reason, it must remove all statements implying that the organization continues to participate in the Privacy Shield or is entitled to the benefits of the Privacy Shield. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification mark, if used, must also be removed. Any misrepresentation to the general public concerning an organization's adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles may be actionable by the FTC or other relevant government body. Misrepresentations to the Department may be actionable under the False Statements Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1001 ). 7. Verification a. Organizations must provide follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they make about their Privacy Shield privacy practices are true and those privacy practices have been implemented as represented and in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. b. To meet the verification requirements of the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle, an organization must verify such attestations and assertions either through self-assessment or outside compliance reviews. c. Under the self-assessment approach, such verification must indicate that an organization's published privacy policy regarding personal information received from the EU is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. It must also indicate that its privacy policy conforms to the Privacy Shield Principles; that individuals are informed of any in-house arrangements for handling complaints and of the independent mechanisms through which they may pursue complaints; that it has in place procedures for training employees in its implementation, and disciplining them for failure to follow it; and that it has in place internal procedures for periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance with the above. A statement verifying the self-assessment must be signed by a corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-compliance. d. Where the organization has chosen outside compliance review, such a review must demonstrate that its privacy policy regarding personal information received from the EU conforms to the Privacy Shield Principles, that it is being complied with, and that individuals are informed of the mechanisms through which they may pursue complaints. The methods of review may include, without limitation, auditing, random reviews, use of decoys, or use of technology tools as appropriate. A statement verifying that an outside compliance review has been successfully completed must be signed either by the reviewer or by the corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about compliance. e. Organizations must retain their records on the implementation of their Privacy Shield privacy practices and make them available upon request in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-compliance to the independent body responsible for investigating complaints or to the agency with unfair and deceptive practices jurisdiction. Organizations must also respond promptly to inquiries and other requests for information from the Department relating to the organization's adherence to the Principles. Start Printed Page 51051 8. Access a. The Access Principle in Practice i. Under the Privacy Shield Principles, the right of access is fundamental to privacy protection. In particular, it allows individuals to verify the accuracy of information held about them. The Access Principle means that individuals have the right to: 1. Obtain from an organization confirmation of whether or not the organization is processing personal data relating to them; [ 4 ] 2. have communicated to them such data so that they could verify its accuracy and the lawfulness of the processing; and 3. have the data corrected, amended or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Principles. ii. Individuals do not have to justify requests for access to their personal data. In responding to individuals' access requests, organizations should first be guided by the concern(s) that led to the requests in the first place. For example, if an access request is vague or broad in scope, an organization may engage the individual in a dialogue so as to better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. The organization might inquire about which part(s) of the organization the individual interacted with or about the nature of the information or its use that is the subject of the access request. iii. Consistent with the fundamental nature of access, organizations should always make good faith efforts to provide access. For example, where certain information needs to be protected and can be readily separated from other personal information subject to an access request, the organization should redact the protected information and make available the other information. If an organization determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, it should provide the individual requesting access with an explanation of why it has made that determination and a contact point for any further inquiries. b. Burden or Expense of Providing Access i. The right of access to personal data may be restricted in exceptional circumstances where the legitimate rights of persons other than the individual would be violated or where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question. Expense and burden are important factors and should be taken into account but they are not controlling factors in determining whether providing access is reasonable. ii. For example, if the personal information is used for decisions that will significantly affect the individual ( e.g., the denial or grant of important benefits, such as insurance, a mortgage, or a job), then consistent with the other provisions of these Supplemental Principles, the organization would have to disclose that information even if it is relatively difficult or expensive to provide. If the personal information requested is not sensitive or not used for decisions that will significantly affect the individual, but is readily available and inexpensive to provide, an organization would have to provide access to such information. c. Confidential Commercial Information i. Confidential commercial information is information that an organization has taken steps to protect from disclosure, where disclosure would help a competitor in the market. Organizations may deny or limit access to the extent that granting full access would reveal its own confidential commercial information, such as marketing inferences or classifications generated by the organization, or the confidential commercial information of another that is subject to a contractual obligation of confidentiality. ii. Where confidential commercial information can be readily separated from other personal information subject to an access request, the organization should redact the confidential commercial information and make available the non-confidential information. d. Organization of Data Bases i. Access can be provided in the form of disclosure of the relevant personal information by an organization to the individual and does not require access by the individual to an organization's data base. ii. Access needs to be provided only to the extent that an organization stores the personal information. The Access Principle does not itself create any obligation to retain, maintain, reorganize, or restructure personal information files. e. When Access May be Restricted i. As organizations must always make good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal data, the circumstances in which organizations may restrict such access are limited, and any reasons for restricting access must be specific. As under the Directive, an organization can restrict access to information to the extent that disclosure is likely to interfere with the safeguarding of important countervailing public interests, such as national security; defense; or public security. In addition, where personal information is processed solely for research or statistical purposes, access may be denied. Other reasons for denying or limiting access are: 1. Interference with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation or detection of offenses or the right to a fair trial; 2. disclosure where the legitimate rights or important interests of others would be violated; 3. breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; 4. prejudicing employee security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with employee succession planning and corporate re-organizations; or 5. prejudicing the confidentiality necessary in monitoring, inspection or regulatory functions connected with sound management, or in future or ongoing negotiations involving the organization. ii. An organization which claims an exception has the burden of demonstrating its necessity, and the reasons for restricting access and a contact point for further inquiries should be given to individuals. f. Right to Obtain Confirmation and Charging a Fee to Cover the Costs for Providing Access i. An individual has the right to obtain confirmation of whether or not this organization has personal data relating to him or her. An individual also has the right to have communicated to him or her personal data relating to him or her. An organization may charge a fee that is not excessive. ii. Charging a fee may be justified, for example, where requests for access are manifestly excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character. iii. Access may not be refused on cost grounds if the individual offers to pay the costs. g. Repetitious or Vexatious Requests for Access i. An organization may set reasonable limits on the number of times within a given period that access requests from a particular individual will be met. In setting such limitations, an organization should consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the data are used, and the nature of the information. h. Fraudulent Requests for Access i. An organization is not required to provide access unless it is supplied with sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request. i. Timeframe for Responses i. Organizations should respond to access requests within a reasonable time period, in a reasonable manner, and in a form that is readily intelligible to the individual. An organization that provides information to data subjects at regular intervals may satisfy an individual access request with its regular disclosure if it would not constitute an excessive delay. 9. Human Resources Data a. Coverage by the Privacy Shield i. Where an organization in the EU transfers personal information about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or unaffiliated service provider in the United States participating in the Privacy Shield, the transfer enjoys the benefits of the Privacy Shield. In such cases, the collection of the information and its processing prior to transfer will have been subject to the national laws of the EU country where it was collected, and any conditions for or restrictions on its transfer according to those laws will have to be respected. ii. The Privacy Shield Principles are relevant only when individually identified or identifiable records are transferred or accessed. Statistical reporting relying on aggregate employment data and containing no personal data or the use of anonymized data does not raise privacy concerns. b. Application of the Notice and Choice Principles i. A U.S. organization that has received employee information from the EU under the Start Printed Page 51052 Privacy Shield may disclose it to third parties or use it for different purposes only in accordance with the Notice and Choice Principles. For example, where an organization intends to use personal information collected through the employment relationship for non-employment-related purposes, such as marketing communications, the U.S. organization must provide the affected individuals with the requisite choice before doing so, unless they have already authorized the use of the information for such purposes. Such use must not be incompatible with the purposes for which the personal information has been collected or subsequently authorised by the individual. Moreover, such choices must not be used to restrict employment opportunities or take any punitive action against such employees. ii. It should be noted that certain generally applicable conditions for transfer from some EU Member States may preclude other uses of such information even after transfer outside the EU and such conditions will have to be respected. iii. In addition, employers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee privacy preferences. This could include, for example, restricting access to the personal data, anonymizing certain data, or assigning codes or pseudonyms when the actual names are not required for the management purpose at hand. iv. To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing the ability of the organization in making promotions, appointments, or other similar employment decisions, an organization does not need to offer notice and choice. c. Application of the Access Principle i. The Supplemental Principle on Access provides guidance on reasons which may justify denying or limiting access on request in the human resources context. Of course, employers in the European Union must comply with local regulations and ensure that European Union employees have access to such information as is required by law in their home countries, regardless of the location of data processing and storage. The Privacy Shield requires that an organization processing such data in the United States will cooperate in providing such access either directly or through the EU employer. d. Enforcement i. In so far as personal information is used only in the context of the employment relationship, primary responsibility for the data vis--vis the employee remains with the organization in the EU. It follows that, where European employees make complaints about violations of their data protection rights and are not satisfied with the results of internal review, complaint, and appeal procedures (or any applicable grievance procedures under a contract with a trade union), they should be directed to the state or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction where the employees work. This includes cases where the alleged mishandling of their personal information is the responsibility of the U.S. organization that has received the information from the employer and thus involves an alleged breach of the Privacy Shield Principles. This will be the most efficient way to address the often overlapping rights and obligations imposed by local labor law and labor agreements as well as data protection law. ii. A U.S. organization participating in the Privacy Shield that uses EU human resources data transferred from the European Union in the context of the employment relationship and that wishes such transfers to be covered by the Privacy Shield must therefore commit to cooperate in investigations by and to comply with the advice of competent EU authorities in such cases. e. Application of the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle i. For occasional employment-related operational needs of the Privacy Shield organization with respect to personal data transferred under the Privacy Shield, such as the booking of a flight, hotel room, or insurance coverage, transfers of personal data of a small number of employees can take place to controllers without application of the Access Principle or entering into a contract with the third-party controller, as otherwise required under the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle, provided that the Privacy Shield organization has complied with the Notice and Choice Principles. 10. Obligatory Contracts for Onward Transfers a. Data Processing Contracts i. When personal data is transferred from the EU to the United States only for processing purposes, a contract will be required, regardless of participation by the processor in the Privacy Shield. ii. Data controllers in the European Union are always required to enter into a contract when a transfer for mere processing is made, whether the processing operation is carried out inside or outside the EU, and whether or not the processor participates in the Privacy Shield. The purpose of the contract is to make sure that the processor: 1. Acts only on instructions from the controller; 2. provides appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alternation, unauthorized disclosure or access, and understands whether onward transfer is allowed; and 3. taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller in responding to individuals exercising their rights under the Principles. iii. Because adequate protection is provided by Privacy Shield participants, contracts with Privacy Shield participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted automatically by the EU Member States), as would be required for contracts with recipients not participating in the Privacy Shield or otherwise not providing adequate protection. b. Transfers within a Controlled Group of Corporations or Entities i. When personal information is transferred between two controllers within a controlled group of corporations or entities, a contract is not always required under the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle. Data controllers within a controlled group of corporations or entities may base such transfers on other instruments, such as EU Binding Corporate Rules or other intra-group instruments ( e.g., compliance and control programs), ensuring the continuity of protection of personal information under the Principles. In case of such transfers, the Privacy Shield organization remains responsible for compliance with the Principles. c. Transfers between Controllers i. For transfers between controllers, the recipient controller need not be a Privacy Shield organization or have an independent recourse mechanism. The Privacy Shield organization must enter into a contract with the recipient third-party controller that provides for the same level of protection as is available under the Privacy Shield, not including the requirement that the third party controller be a Privacy Shield organization or have an independent recourse mechanism, provided it makes available an equivalent mechanism. 11. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement a. The Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle sets out the requirements for Privacy Shield enforcement. How to meet the requirements of point (a)(ii) of the Principle is set out in the Supplemental Principle on Verification. This Supplemental Principle addresses points (a)(i) and (a)(iii), both of which require independent recourse mechanisms. These mechanisms may take different forms, but they must meet the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle's requirements. Organizations satisfy the requirements through the following: (i) Compliance with private sector developed privacy programs that incorporate the Privacy Shield Principles into their rules and that include effective enforcement mechanisms of the type described in the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle; (ii) compliance with legal or regulatory supervisory authorities that provide for handling of individual complaints and dispute resolution; or (iii) commitment to cooperate with data protection authorities located in the European Union or their authorized representatives. b. This list is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The private sector may design additional mechanisms to provide enforcement, so long as they meet the requirements of the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle and the Supplemental Principles. Please note that the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle's requirements are additional to the requirement that self-regulatory efforts must be enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts, or another law or regulation prohibiting such acts. c. In order to help ensure compliance with their Privacy Shield commitments and to support the administration of the program, organizations, as well as their independent recourse mechanisms, must provide information relating to the Privacy Shield when requested by the Department. In addition, organizations must respond Start Printed Page 51053 expeditiously to complaints regarding their compliance with the Principles referred through the Department by DPAs. The response should address whether the complaint has merit and, if so, how the organization will rectify the problem. The Department will protect the confidentiality of information it receives in accordance with U.S. law. d. Recourse Mechanisms i. Consumers should be encouraged to raise any complaints they may have with the relevant organization before proceeding to independent recourse mechanisms. Organizations must respond to a consumer within 45 days of receiving a complaint. Whether a recourse mechanism is independent is a factual question that can be demonstrated notably by impartiality, transparent composition and financing, and a proven track record. As required by the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle, the recourse available to individuals must be readily available and free of charge to individuals. Dispute resolution bodies should look into each complaint received from individuals unless they are obviously unfounded or frivolous. This does not preclude the establishment of eligibility requirements by the organization operating the recourse mechanism, but such requirements should be transparent and justified (for example, to exclude complaints that fall outside the scope of the program or are for consideration in another forum), and should not have the effect of undermining the commitment to look into legitimate complaints. In addition, recourse mechanisms should provide individuals with full and readily available information about how the dispute resolution procedure works when they file a complaint. Such information should include notice about the mechanism's privacy practices, in conformity with the Privacy Shield Principles. They should also cooperate in the development of tools such as standard complaint forms to facilitate the complaint resolution process. ii. Independent recourse mechanisms must include on their public Web sites information regarding the Privacy Shield Principles and the services that they provide under the Privacy Shield. This information must include: (1) Information on or a link to the Privacy Shield Principles' requirements for independent recourse mechanisms; (2) a link to the Department's Privacy Shield Web site; (3) an explanation that their dispute resolution services under the Privacy Shield are free of charge to individuals; (4) a description of how a Privacy Shield-related complaint can be filed; (5) the timeframe in which Privacy Shield-related complaints are processed; and (6) a description of the range of potential remedies. iii. Independent recourse mechanisms must publish an annual report providing aggregate statistics regarding their dispute resolution services. The annual report must include: (1) The total number of Privacy Shield-related complaints received during the reporting year; (2) the types of complaints received; (3) dispute resolution quality measures, such as the length of time taken to process complaints; and (4) the outcomes of the complaints received, notably the number and types of remedies or sanctions imposed. iv. As set forth in Annex I, an arbitration option is available to an individual to determine, for residual claims, whether a Privacy Shield organization has violated its obligations under the Principles as to that individual, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available only for these purposes. This option is not available, for example, with respect to the exceptions to the Principles [ 5 ] or with respect to an allegation about the adequacy of the Privacy Shield. Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel (consisting of one or three arbitrators, as agreed by the parties) has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return of the individual's data in question) necessary to remedy the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual. Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to seek judicial review and enforcement of the arbitral decisions pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act. e. Remedies and Sanctions i. The result of any remedies provided by the dispute resolution body should be that the effects of non-compliance are reversed or corrected by the organization, insofar as feasible, and that future processing by the organization will be in conformity with the Principles and, where appropriate, that processing of the personal data of the individual who brought the complaint will cease. Sanctions need to be rigorous enough to ensure compliance by the organization with the Principles. A range of sanctions of varying degrees of severity will allow dispute resolution bodies to respond appropriately to varying degrees of non-compliance. Sanctions should include both publicity for findings of non-compliance and the requirement to delete data in certain circumstances. [ 6 ] Other sanctions could include suspension and removal of a seal, compensation for individuals for losses incurred as a result of non-compliance and injunctive awards. Private sector dispute resolution bodies and self-regulatory bodies must notify failures of Privacy Shield organizations to comply with their rulings to the governmental body with applicable jurisdiction or to the courts, as appropriate, and to notify the Department. f. FTC Action ii. The FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis referrals alleging non-compliance with the Principles received from: (i) Privacy self-regulatory organizations and other independent dispute resolution bodies; (ii) EU Member States; and (iii) the Department, to determine whether Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce has been violated. If the FTC concludes that it has reason to believe Section 5 has been violated, it may resolve the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in a federal district court, which if successful could result in a federal court order to same effect. This includes false claims of adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles or participation in the Privacy Shield by organizations, which either are no longer on the Privacy Shield List or have never self-certified to the Department. The FTC may obtain civil penalties for violations of an administrative cease and desist order and may pursue civil or criminal contempt for violation of a federal court order. The FTC will notify the Department of any such actions it takes. The Department encourages other government bodies to notify it of the final disposition of any such referrals or other rulings determining adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. g. Persistent Failure to Comply i. If an organization persistently fails to comply with the Principles, it is no longer entitled to benefit from the Privacy Shield. Organizations that have persistently failed to comply with the Principles will be removed from the Privacy Shield List by the Department and must return or delete the personal information they received under the Privacy Shield. ii. Persistent failure to comply arises where an organization that has self-certified to the Department refuses to comply with a final determination by any privacy self-regulatory, independent dispute resolution, or government body, or where such a body determines that an organization frequently fails to comply with the Principles to the point where its claim to comply is no longer credible. In these cases, the organization must promptly notify the Department of such facts. Failure to do so may be actionable under the False Statements Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1001 ). An organization's withdrawal from a private-sector privacy self-regulatory program or independent dispute resolution mechanism does not relieve it of its obligation to comply with the Principles and would constitute a persistent failure to comply. iii. The Department will remove an organization from the Privacy Shield List in response to any notification it receives of persistent failure to comply, whether it is received from the organization itself, from a privacy self-regulatory body or another independent dispute resolution body, or from a government body, but only after first providing 30 days' notice and an opportunity to respond to the organization that has failed to comply. Accordingly, the Privacy Shield List maintained by the Department will make clear which organizations are assured and which organizations are no longer assured of Privacy Shield benefits. iv. An organization applying to participate in a self-regulatory body for the purposes of requalifying for the Privacy Shield must provide that body with full information about its prior participation in the Privacy Shield. 12. ChoiceTiming of Opt Out a. Generally, the purpose of the Choice Principle is to ensure that personal information is used and disclosed in ways Start Printed Page 51054 that are consistent with the individual's expectations and choices. Accordingly, an individual should be able to exercise opt out choice of having personal information used for direct marketing at any time subject to reasonable limits established by the organization, such as giving the organization time to make the opt out effective. An organization may also require sufficient information to confirm the identity of the individual requesting the opt out. In the United States, individuals may be able to exercise this option through the use of a central opt out program such as the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service. Organizations that participate in the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service should promote its availability to consumers who do not wish to receive commercial information. In any event, an individual should be given a readily available and affordable mechanism to exercise this option. b. Similarly, an organization may use information for certain direct marketing purposes when it is impracticable to provide the individual with an opportunity to opt out before using the information, if the organization promptly gives the individual such opportunity at the same time (and upon request at any time) to decline (at no cost to the individual) to receive any further direct marketing communications and the organization complies with the individual's wishes. 13. Travel Information a. Airline passenger reservation and other travel information, such as frequent flyer or hotel reservation information and special handling needs, such as meals to meet religious requirements or physical assistance, may be transferred to organizations located outside the EU in several different circumstances. Under Article 26 of the Directive, personal data may be transferred to a third country which does not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 25(2) on the condition that it (i) is necessary to provide the services requested by the consumer or to fulfill the terms of an agreement, such as a frequent flyer agreement; or (ii) has been unambiguously consented to by the consumer. U.S. organizations subscribing to the Privacy Shield provide adequate protection for personal data and may therefore receive data transfers from the EU without meeting these conditions or other conditions set out in Article 26 of the Directive. Since the Privacy Shield includes specific rules for sensitive information, such information (which may need to be collected, for example, in connection with customers' needs for physical assistance) may be included in transfers to Privacy Shield participants. In all cases, however, the organization transferring the information has to respect the law in the EU Member State in which it is operating, which may inter alia impose special conditions for the handling of sensitive data. 14. Pharmaceutical and Medical Products a. Application of EU Member State Laws or the Privacy Shield Principles i. EU Member State law applies to the collection of the personal data and to any processing that takes place prior to the transfer to the United States. The Privacy Shield Principles apply to the data once they have been transferred to the United States. Data used for pharmaceutical research and other purposes should be anonymized when appropriate. b. Future Scientific Research i. Personal data developed in specific medical or pharmaceutical research studies often play a valuable role in future scientific research. Where personal data collected for one research study are transferred to a U.S. organization in the Privacy Shield, the organization may use the data for a new scientific research activity if appropriate notice and choice have been provided in the first instance. Such notice should provide information about any future specific uses of the data, such as periodic follow-up, related studies, or marketing. ii. It is understood that not all future uses of the data can be specified, since a new research use could arise from new insights on the original data, new medical discoveries and advances, and public health and regulatory developments. Where appropriate, the notice should therefore include an explanation that personal data may be used in future medical and pharmaceutical research activities that are unanticipated. If the use is not consistent with the general research purpose(s) for which the personal data were originally collected, or to which the individual has consented subsequently, new consent must be obtained. c. Withdrawal from a Clinical Trial i. Participants may decide or be asked to withdraw from a clinical trial at any time. Any personal data collected previous to withdrawal may still be processed along with other data collected as part of the clinical trial, however, if this was made clear to the participant in the notice at the time he or she agreed to participate. d. Transfers for Regulatory and Supervision Purposes i. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are allowed to provide personal data from clinical trials conducted in the EU to regulators in the United States for regulatory and supervision purposes. Similar transfers are allowed to parties other than regulators, such as company locations and other researchers, consistent with the Principles of Notice and Choice. e. Blinded Studies i. To ensure objectivity in many clinical trials, participants, and often investigators as well, cannot be given access to information about which treatment each participant may be receiving. Doing so would jeopardize the validity of the research study and results. Participants in such clinical trials (referred to as blinded studies) do not have to be provided access to the data on their treatment during the trial if this restriction has been explained when the participant entered the trial and the disclosure of such information would jeopardize the integrity of the research effort. ii. Agreement to participate in the trial under these conditions is a reasonable forgoing of the right of access. Following the conclusion of the trial and analysis of the results, participants should have access to their data if they request it. They should seek it primarily from the physician or other health care provider from whom they received treatment within the clinical trial, or secondarily from the sponsoring organization. f. Product Safety and Efficacy Monitoring i. A pharmaceutical or medical device company does not have to apply the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, and Access Principles in its product safety and efficacy monitoring activities, including the reporting of adverse events and the tracking of patients/subjects using certain medicines or medical devices, to the extent that adherence to the Principles interferes with compliance with regulatory requirements. This is true both with respect to reports by, for example, health care providers to pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and with respect to reports by pharmaceutical and medical device companies to government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration. g. Key-coded Data i. Invariably, research data are uniquely key-coded at their origin by the principal investigator so as not to reveal the identity of individual data subjects. Pharmaceutical companies sponsoring such research do not receive the key. The unique key code is held only by the researcher, so that he or she can identify the research subject under special circumstances ( e.g., if follow-up medical attention is required). A transfer from the EU to the United States of data coded in this way would not constitute a transfer of personal data that would be subject to the Privacy Shield Principles. 15. Public Record and Publicly Available Information a. An organization must apply the Privacy Shield Principles of Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability to personal data from publicly available sources. These Principles shall apply also to personal data collected from public records, i.e., those records kept by government agencies or entities at any level that are open to consultation by the public in general. b. It is not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice, or Accountability for Onward Transfer Principles to public record information, as long as it is not combined with non-public record information, and any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are respected. Also, it is generally not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice, or Accountability for Onward Transfer Principles to publicly available information unless the European transferor indicates that such information is subject to restrictions that require application of those Principles by the organization for the uses it intends. Organizations will have no liability for how such information is used by those obtaining such information from published materials. c. Where an organization is found to have intentionally made personal information public in contravention of the Principles so Start Printed Page 51055 that it or others may benefit from these exceptions, it will cease to qualify for the benefits of the Privacy Shield. d. It is not necessary to apply the Access Principle to public record information as long as it is not combined with other personal information (apart from small amounts used to index or organize the public record information); however, any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are to be respected. In contrast, where public record information is combined with other non-public record information (other than as specifically noted above), an organization must provide access to all such information, assuming it is not subject to other permitted exceptions. e. As with public record information, it is not necessary to provide access to information that is already publicly available to the public at large, as long as it is not combined with non-publicly available information. Organizations that are in the business of selling publicly available information may charge the organization's customary fee in responding to requests for access. Alternatively, individuals may seek access to their information from the organization that originally compiled the data. 16. Access Requests by Public Authorities a. In order to provide transparency in respect of lawful requests by public authorities to access personal information, Privacy Shield organizations may voluntarily issue periodic transparency reports on the number of requests for personal information they receive by public authorities for law enforcement or national security reasons, to the extent such disclosures are permissible under applicable law. b. The information provided by the Privacy Shield organizations in these reports together with information that has been released by the intelligence community, along with other information, can be used to inform the annual joint review of the functioning of the Privacy Shield in accordance with the Principles. c. Absence of notice in accordance with point (a)(xii) of the Notice Principle shall not prevent or impair an organization's ability to respond to any lawful request. Annex I: Arbitral Model Annex I This Annex I provides the terms under which Privacy Shield organizations are obligated to arbitrate claims, pursuant to the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle. The binding arbitration option described below applies to certain residual claims as to data covered by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The purpose of this option is to provide a prompt, independent, and fair mechanism, at the option of individuals, for resolution of claimed violations of the Principles not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms, if any. A. Scope This arbitration option is available to an individual to determine, for residual claims, whether a Privacy Shield organization has violated its obligations under the Principles as to that individual, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available only for these purposes. This option is not available, for example, with respect to the exceptions to the Principles [ 7 ] or with respect to an allegation about the adequacy of the Privacy Shield. B. Available Remedies Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel (consisting of one or three arbitrators, as agreed by the parties) has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return of the individual's data in question) necessary to remedy the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual. These are the only powers of the arbitration panel with respect to remedies. In considering remedies, the arbitration panel is required to consider other remedies that already have been imposed by other mechanisms under the Privacy Shield. No damages, costs, fees, or other remedies are available. Each party bears its own attorney's fees. C. Pre-Arbitration Requirements An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) Raise the claimed violation directly with the organization and afford the organization an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the individual. This arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual's same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties. In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU Data Protection Authority (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation directly with the organization. A DPA's authority to resolve the same claim against an EU data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA authority. D. Binding Nature of Decisions An individual's decision to invoke this binding arbitration option is entirely voluntary. Arbitral decisions will be binding on all parties to the arbitration. Once invoked, the individual forgoes the option to seek relief for the same claimed violation in another forum, except that if non-monetary equitable relief does not fully remedy the claimed violation, the individual's invocation of arbitration will not preclude a claim for damages that is otherwise available in the courts. E. Review and Enforcement Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to seek judicial review and enforcement of the arbitral decisions pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act. [ 8 ] Any such cases must be brought in the federal district court whose territorial coverage includes the primary place of business of the Privacy Shield organization. This arbitration option is intended to resolve individual disputes, and arbitral decisions are not intended to function as persuasive or binding precedent in matters involving other parties, including in future arbitrations or in EU or U.S. courts, or FTC proceedings. F. The Arbitration Panel The parties will select the arbitrators from the list of arbitrators discussed below. Consistent with applicable law, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Start Printed Page 51056 Commission will develop a list of at least 20 arbitrators, chosen on the basis of independence, integrity, and expertise. The following shall apply in connection with this process: Arbitrators: (1) Will remain on the list for a period of 3 years, absent exceptional circumstances or for cause, renewable for one additional period of 3 years; (2) shall not be subject to any instructions from, or be affiliated with, either party, or any Privacy Shield organization, or the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental authority, public authority, or enforcement authority; and (3) must be admitted to practice law in the U.S. and be experts in U.S. privacy law, with expertise in EU data protection law. G. Arbitration Procedures Consistent with applicable law, within 6 months from the adoption of the adequacy decision, the Department of Commerce and the European Commission will agree to adopt an existing, well-established set of U.S. arbitral procedures (such as AAA or JAMS) to govern proceedings before the Privacy Shield Panel, subject to each of the following considerations: 1. An individual may initiate binding arbitration, subject to the pre-arbitration requirements provision above, by delivering a Notice to the organization. The Notice shall contain a summary of steps taken under Paragraph C to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim. 2. Procedures will be developed to ensure that an individual's same claimed violation does not receive duplicative remedies or procedures. 3. FTC action may proceed in parallel with arbitration. 4. No representative of the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental authority, public authority, or enforcement authority may participate in these arbitrations, provided, that at the request of an EU individual, EU DPAs may provide assistance in the preparation only of the Notice but EU DPAs may not have access to discovery or any other materials related to these arbitrations. 5. The location of the arbitration will be the United States, and the individual may choose video or telephone participation, which will be provided at no cost to the individual. In-person participation will not be required. 6. The language of the arbitration will be English unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Upon a reasoned request, and taking into account whether the individual is represented by an attorney, interpretation at the arbitral hearing as well as translation of arbitral materials will be provided at no cost to the individual, unless the panel finds that, under the circumstances of the specific arbitration, this would lead to unjustified or disproportionate costs. 7. Materials submitted to arbitrators will be treated confidentially and will only be used in connection with the arbitration. 8. Individual-specific discovery may be permitted if necessary, and such discovery will be treated confidentially by the parties and will only be used in connection with the arbitration. 9. Arbitrations should be completed within 90 days of the delivery of the Notice to the organization at issue, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. H. Costs Arbitrators should take reasonable steps to minimize the costs or fees of the arbitrations. Subject to applicable law, the Department of Commerce will facilitate the establishment of a fund, into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay an annual contribution, based in part on the size of the organization, which will cover the arbitral cost, including arbitrator fees, up to maximum amounts (caps), in consultation with the European Commission. The fund will be managed by a third party, which will report regularly on the operations of the fund. At the annual review, the Department of Commerce and European Commission will review the operation of the fund, including the need to adjust the amount of the contributions or of the caps, and will consider, among other things, the number of arbitrations and the costs and timing of the arbitrations, with the mutual understanding that there will be no excessive financial burden imposed on Privacy Shield organizations. Attorney's fees are not covered by this provision or any fund under this provision. Letter From U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry July 7, 2016 Dear Commissioner Jourov, I am pleased we have reached an understanding on the European Union-United States Privacy Shield that will include an Ombudsperson mechanism through which authorities in the EU will be able to submit requests on behalf of EU individuals regarding U.S. signals intelligence practices. On January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama announced important intelligence reforms included in Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28). Under PPD-28, I designated Under Secretary of State Catherine A. Novelli, who also serves as Senior Coordinator for International Information Technology Diplomacy, as our point of contact for foreign governments that wish to raise concerns regarding U.S. signals intelligence activities. Building on this role, I have established a Privacy Shield Ombudsperson mechanism in accordance with the terms set out in Annex A, which have been updated since my letter of February 22, 2016. I have directed Under Secretary Novelli to perform this function. Under Secretary Novelli is independent from the U.S. intelligence community, and reports directly to me. I have directed my staff to devote the necessary resources to implement this new Ombudsperson mechanism, and am confident it will be an effective means to address EU individuals' concerns. Sincerely, John F. Kerry Annex A: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Ombudsperson Mechanism EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Ombudsperson Mechanism Regarding Signals Intelligence In recognition of the importance of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, this Memorandum sets forth the process for implementing a new mechanism, consistent with Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), regarding signals intelligence. [ 9 ] On January 17, 2014, President Obama gave a speech announcing important intelligence reforms. In that speech, he pointed out that [o]ur efforts help protect not only our nation, but our friends and allies as well. Our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy too. President Obama announced the issuance of a new presidential directivePPD-28to clearly prescribe what we do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance. Section 4(d) of PPD-28 directs the Secretary of State to designate a Senior Coordinator for International Information Technology Diplomacy (Senior Coordinator) to . . . serve as a point of contact for foreign governments who wish to raise concerns regarding signals intelligence activities conducted by the United States. As of January 2015, Under Secretary C. Novelli has served as the Senior Coordinator. This Memorandum describes a new mechanism that the Senior Coordinator will follow to facilitate the processing of requests relating to national security access to data transmitted from the EU to the United States pursuant to the Privacy Shield, standard contractual clauses (SCCs), binding corporate rules (BCRs), Derogations, [ 10 ] or Possible Future Derogations, [ 11 ] through established Start Printed Page 51057 avenues under applicable United States laws and policy, and the response to those requests. 1. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson. The Senior Coordinator will serve as the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson and designate additional State Department officials, as appropriate to assist in her performance of the responsibilities detailed in this memorandum. (Hereinafter, the Coordinator and any officials performing such duties will be referred to as Privacy Shield Ombudsperson.) The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will work closely with appropriate officials from other departments and agencies who are responsible for processing requests in accordance with applicable United States law and policy. The Ombudsperson is independent from the Intelligence Community. The Ombudsperson reports directly to the Secretary of State who will ensure that the Ombudsperson carries out its function objectively and free from improper influence that is liable to have an effect on the response to be provided. 2. Effective Coordination. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to effectively use and coordinate with the oversight bodies, described below, in order to ensure that the Ombudsperson's response to requests from the submitting EU individual complaint handing body is based on the necessary information. When the request relates to the compatibility of surveillance with U.S. law, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to cooperate with one of the independent oversight bodies with investigatory powers. a. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will work closely with other United States Government officials, including appropriate independent oversight bodies, to ensure that completed requests are processed and resolved in accordance with applicable laws and policies. In particular, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to coordinate closely with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Justice, and other departments and agencies involved in United States national security as appropriate, and Inspectors General, Freedom of Information Act Officers, and Civil Liberties and Privacy Officers. b. The United States Government will rely on mechanisms for coordinating and overseeing national security matters across departments and agencies to help ensure that the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson is able to respond within the meaning of Section 4(e) to completed requests under Section 3(b). c. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson may refer matters related to requests to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board for its consideration. 3. Submitting Requests. a. A request will initially be submitted to the supervisory authorities in the Member States competent for the oversight of national security services and/or the processing of personal data by public authorities. The request will be submitted to the Ombudsperson by a EU centralized body (hereafter together: The EU individual complaint handling body). b. The EU individual complaint handling body will ensure, in compliance with the following actions, that the request is complete: (i) Verifying the identity of the individual, and that the individual is acting on his/her own behalf, and not as a representative of a governmental or intergovernmental organization. (ii) Ensuring the request is made in writing, and that it contains the following basic information: Any information that forms the basis for the request, the nature of information or relief sought, the United States Government entities believed to be involved, if any, and the other measures pursued to obtain the information or relief requested and the response received through those other measures. (iii) Verifying that the request pertains to data reasonably believed to have been transferred from the EU to the United States pursuant to the Privacy Shield, SCCs, BCRs, Derogations, or Possible Future Derogations. (iv) Making an initial determination that the request is not frivolous, vexatious, or made in bad faith. c. To be completed for purposes of further handling by the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson under this memorandum, the request need not demonstrate that the requester's data has in fact been accessed by the United States Government through signal intelligence activities. 4. Commitments to Communicate with Submitting EU Individual Complaint Handling Body. a. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will acknowledge receipt of the request to the submitting EU individual complaint handling body. b. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will conduct an initial review to verify that the request has been completed in conformance with Section 3(b). If the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson notes any deficiencies or has any questions regarding the completion of the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will seek to address and resolve those concerns with the submitting EU individual complaint handling body. c. If, to facilitate appropriate processing of the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson needs more information about the request, or if specific action is needed to be taken by the individual who originally submitted the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will so inform the submitting EU individual complaint handling body. d. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will track the status of requests and provide updates as appropriate to the submitting EU individual complaint handling body. e. Once a request has been completed as described in Section 3 of this Memorandum, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will provide in a timely manner an appropriate response to the submitting EU individual complaint handling body, subject to the continuing obligation to protect information under applicable laws and policies. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will provide a response to the submitting EU individual complaint handling body confirming (i) that the complaint has been properly investigated, and (ii) that the U.S. law, statutes, executives orders, presidential directives, and agency policies, providing the limitations and safeguards described in the ODNI letter, have been complied with, or, in the event of non-compliance, such non-compliance has been remedied. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will neither confirm nor deny whether the individual has been the target of surveillance nor will the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson confirm the specific remedy that was applied. As further explained in Section 5, FOIA requests will be processed as provided under that statute and applicable regulations. f. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will communicate directly with the EU individual complaint handling body, who will in turn be responsible for communicating with the individual submitting the request. If direct communications are part of one of the underlying processes described below, then those communications will take place in accordance with existing procedures. g. Commitments in this Memorandum will not apply to general claims that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is inconsistent with European Union data protection requirements. The commitments in this Memorandum are made based on the common understanding by the European Commission and the U.S. government that given the scope of commitments under this mechanism, there may be resource constraints that arise, including with respect to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Should the carrying-out of the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson's functions exceed reasonable resource constraints and impede the fulfillment of these commitments, the U.S. government will discuss with the European Commission any adjustments that may be appropriate to address the situation. 5. Requests for Information. Requests for access to United States Government records may be made and processed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). a. FOIA provides a means for any person to seek access to existing federal agency records, regardless of the nationality of the requester. This statute is codified in the United States Code at 5 U.S.C. 552 . The statute, together with additional information about FOIA, is available at www.FOIA.gov Start Printed Page 51058 and     Provided that the Commission Decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield applies to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the Privacy Shield Package will cover both the European Union, as well as these three countries. Back to Citation 1.\n    Section I.5 of the Principles. Back to Citation 2.\n    Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) provides that [a]n arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial, including a transaction, contract, or agreement described in [section 2 of the FAA], falls under the Convention [on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2519, T.I.A.S. No. 6997 (New York Convention)]. 9 U.S.C. 202 . The FAA further provides that [a]n agreement or award arising out of such a relationship which is entirely between citizens of the United States shall be deemed not to fall under the [New York] Convention unless that relationship involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states. Id. Under Chapter 2, any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration. The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said [New York] Convention. Id. 207. Chapter 2 further provides that [t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have original jurisdiction over . . . an action or proceeding [under the New York Convention], regardless of the amount in controversy. Id. section 203. Chapter 2 also provides that Chapter 1 applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter to the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter or the [New York] Convention as ratified by the United States. Id. section 208. Chapter 1, in turn, provides that [a] written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. Id. section 2. Chapter 1 further provides that any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of [the FAA]. Id. section 9. Back to Citation 1.\n    Provided that the Commission Decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield applies to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the Privacy Shield Package will cover both the European Union, as well as these three countries. Consequently, references to the EU and its Member States will be read as including Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Back to Citation 2.\n    Depending on the circumstances, examples of compatible processing purposes may include those that reasonably serve customer relations, compliance and legal considerations, auditing, security and fraud prevention, preserving or defending the organization's legal rights, or other purposes consistent with the expectations of a reasonable person given the context of the collection. Back to Citation 3.\n    In this context, if, given the means of identification reasonably likely to be used (considering, among other things, the costs of and the amount of time required for identification and the available technology at the time of the processing) and the form in which the data is retained, an individual could reasonably be identified by the organization, or a third party if it would have access to the data, then the individual is identifiable. Back to Citation 4.\n    The organization should answer requests from an individual concerning the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data is disclosed. Back to Citation 5.\n    Section I.5 of the Principles. Back to Citation 6.\n    Dispute resolution bodies have discretion about the circumstances in which they use these sanctions. The sensitivity of the data concerned is one factor to be taken into consideration in deciding whether deletion of data should be required, as is whether an organization has collected, used, or disclosed information in blatant contravention of the Privacy Shield Principles. Back to Citation 7.\n    Section I.5 of the Principles. Back to Citation 8.\n    Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) provides that [a]n arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial, including a transaction, contract, or agreement described in [section 2 of the FAA], falls under the Convention [on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2519, T.I.A.S. No. 6997 (New York Convention)]. 9 U.S.C. 202 . The FAA further provides that [a]n agreement or award arising out of such a relationship which is entirely between citizens of the United States shall be deemed not to fall under the [New York] Convention unless that relationship involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states. Id. Under Chapter 2, any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration. The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said [New York] Convention. Id. section 207. Chapter 2 further provides that [t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have original jurisdiction over . . . an action or proceeding [under the New York Convention], regardless of the amount in controversy. Id. section 203. Chapter 2 also provides that Chapter 1 applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter to the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter or the [New York] Convention as ratified by the United States. Id. section 208. Chapter 1, in turn, provides that [a] written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. Id. section 2. Chapter 1 further provides that any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of [the FAA]. Id. section 9. Back to Citation 9.\n    Provided that the Commission Decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield applies to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the Privacy Shield Package will cover both the European Union, as well as these three countries. Consequently, references to the EU and its Member States will be read as including Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Back to Citation 10.\n    Derogations in this context mean a commercial transfer or transfers that take place on the condition that: (a) the data subject has given his consent unambiguously to the proposed transfer; or (b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of precontractual measures taken in response to the data subject's request; or (c) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and a third party; or (d) the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (e) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or (f) the transfer is made from a register which according to laws or regulations is intended to provide information to the public and which is open to consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate legitimate interest, to the extent that the conditions laid down in law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case. Back to Citation 11.\n    Possible Future Derogations in this context mean a commercial transfer or transfers that take place on one of the following conditions, to the extent the condition constitutes lawful grounds for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S.: (a) The data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards; or (b) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or (c) in case of a transfer to a third country or an international organization and none of the other derogations or possible future derogations is applicable, only if the transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. Back to Citation 12.\n    We provide additional information about U.S. federal and state privacy laws in Attachment A. In addition, a summary of our recent privacy and security enforcement actions is available on the FTC's Web site at     Letter from Ken Hyatt, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, International Trade Administration, to Vra Jourov, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. Back to Citation 23.\n    In determining whether to exercise its U.S. SAFE WEB Act authority, the FTC considers, inter alia: (A) whether the requesting agency has agreed to provide or will provide reciprocal assistance to the Commission; (B) whether compliance with the request would prejudice the public interest of the United States; and (C) whether the requesting agency's investigation or enforcement proceeding concerns acts or practices that cause or are likely to cause injury to a significant number of persons. 15 U.S.C. 46 (j)(3). This authority does not apply to enforcement of competition laws. Back to Citation 24.\n    In fiscal years 2012-2015, for example, the FTC used its U.S. SAFE WEB Act authority to share information in response to almost 60 requests from foreign agencies and it issued nearly 60 civil investigative demands (equivalent to administrative subpoenas) to aid 25 foreign investigations. Back to Citation 25.\n    Although the FTC does not resolve or mediate individual consumer complaints, the FTC affirms that it will prioritize Privacy Shield referrals from EU DPAs. In addition, the FTC uses complaints in its Consumer Sentinel database, which is accessible by many other law enforcement agencies, to identify trends, determine enforcement priorities, and identify potential investigative targets. EU individuals can use the same complaint system available to U.S. citizens to submit a complaint to the FTC at www.ftc.gov/complaint . For individual Privacy Shield complaints, however, it may be most useful for EU individuals to submit complaints to their Member State DPA or alternative dispute resolution provider. Back to Citation 26. 15 U.S.C. 45 (m); 16 CFR 1.98 . Back to Citation 27. See FTC, Business Center, Legal Resources,     Any entity that fails to comply with an FTC order is subject to a civil penalty of up to $16,000 per violation, or $16,000 per day for a continuing violation. See 15 U.S.C. 45 (l); 16 CFR 1.98 (c). Back to Citation 2.\n    Congress has expressly affirmed the FTC's authority to seek legal remedies, including restitution, for any acts or  practices involving foreign commerce that (1) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury in the United States, or (2) involve material conduct occurring within the United States. See 15 U.S.C. 45 (a)(4). Back to Citation 3.\n    In some instances, the Commission's privacy and data security cases allege that a company engaged in both deceptive and unfair practices; these cases also sometimes involve alleged violations of multiple statues, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and COPPA. Back to Citation 4. See, e.g., Press Release, Fed. Trade Comm'n, FTC Warns Children's App Maker BabyBus About Potential COPPA Violations (Dec. 22, 2014),     For a more comprehensive summary of the legal protections in the United States, see Daniel J. Solove & Paul Schwartz, Information Privacy Law (5th ed. 2015). Back to Citation 7.\n    Financial institutions are defined very broadly under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to include all businesses that are significantly engaged in providing financial products or services. This includes, for example, check-cashing businesses, payday lenders, mortgage brokers, nonbank lenders, personal property or real estate appraisers, and professional tax preparers. Back to Citation 8.\n    Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), Title X of Pub. L. 111-203 , 124 Stat. 1955 (July 21, 2010) (also known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), most of the FTC's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act rulemaking authority was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The FTC retains enforcement authority under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as well as rulemaking authority for the Safeguards Rule and limited rulemaking authority under the Privacy Rule with respect to auto dealers. Back to Citation 9.\n    Under the CFPA, the Commission shares its FCRA enforcement role with the CFPB, but rulemaking authority transferred in large part to the CFPB (with the exception of the Red Flags and Disposal Rules). Back to Citation 10. See 45 CFR parts 160 , 162, and 164. Back to Citation 11. See e.g., American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L.

Back to Citation 12. 50 U.S.C. 1881 a. Back to Citation 13.\n    The United States also may obtain court orders pursuant to other provisions of FISA for the production of data, including data transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield. See 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Titles I and III of FISA, which respectively authorize electronic surveillance and physical searches, require a court order (except in emergency circumstances) and always require probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Title IV of FISA authorizes the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices, pursuant to court order (except in emergency circumstances) in authorized foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or counterterrorism investigations. Title V of FISA permits the FBI, pursuant to court order (except in emergency circumstances), to obtain business records that are relevant to an authorized foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or counterterrorism investigations. As discussed below, the USA FREEDOM Act specifically prohibits the use of FISA pen register or business record orders for bulk collection, and imposes a requirement of a specific selection term to ensure that those authorities are used in a targeted fashion.

S"Start Preamble AGENCY: Department of the Army, DoD. ACTION: Notice of a partially closed meeting. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 (5 U.S.C., Appendix, as amended), the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976 (U.S.C. 552b, as amended) and 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 102-3.140 through 160, the Department of the Army announces the following committee meeting: Name of Committee: Army Science Board (ASB) Summer Voting Session. Date: Wednesday, July 27 and Thursday, July 28, 2016. Time: Closed portion: 1330-1700 on July 27, 2016. Open portion: 0900-1200 on July 28, 2016. Location: Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, 100 Academy Way, Irvine, CA 92617. Purpose of Meeting: The purpose of the meeting is for all members of the Board and its subcommittees to meet and present five of six Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) studies to the voting members for their consideration, deliberation, and vote. Agenda: The board will present findings and recommendations for deliberation and vote on the following five FY16 studies: The Military Benefits and Risks of the Internet of Things. This study is not classified and will be presented during the open portion of the meeting. The purpose of this study is to determine the advisability of the Army applying the commercial practice of networking civilian physical systems into a military analog of the internet of things (IOT). As IOT moves beyond the exchange of information in cyber space to the networking of operating systems of physical objects. It will apply and extend relevant findings and recommendations of the Army Science Board studies on cyber vulnerability and electronics countermeasures, the Navy Studies Board network vulnerability study, and the Defense Science Board cyber vulnerability study and autonomy study. Robotic and Autonomous Systems-of-Systems Architecture. This study contains classified and unclassified material and will be presented in the open and closed portions of the meeting. The objective of this study is to identify the Army formations with the greatest potential to benefit from adoption of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) technology in both the near term (7-10 years) and the long term (10-25 years). For each selected application, the study will define the benefits of RAS, considering such factors as cost, manpower reduction, survivability, and mission effectiveness. The study team will make maximum use of existing platforms available in the Army, other Services, or commercially. Countering Enemy Indirect Fires, Target Acquisition Using Unmanned Aerial Systems, and Offensive Cyber/Electronic Warfare Capabilities. This study is classified and will be presented in the closed meeting. The purpose of this study is to conduct a thorough threat assessment of capabilities, both today and in the future, of various adversaries; examine existing and potential means to counter each element of indirect fire systems, to include target acquisition using unmanned aerial systems, and direction finding technologies; develop means to counter each element of the indirect fire systems and determine the effect of countering each element; determine the cost (manpower and materiel) and effectiveness of the counter to each element of the threat system; determine if modern means of engineering and manufacturing can correct the problems in many of today's munitions that cause them to become treaty prohibited; determine the cost-effectiveness of combining various counter means to threat systems; and propose the most cost-effective set of actions necessary to counter future enemy indirect fire capabilities. Future Armor/Anti-Armor Competition. This study is classified and will be presented in the closed meeting. The study objective is to provide an independent assessment of current and future anti-armor weapons versus armored vehicles. Army Efforts to Enhance Soldier and Team Performance. This study contains classified and unclassified material and will be presented in the open and closed portions of the meeting. This study will provide an independent assessment of current and future Soldier enhancement techniques the Army may adopt as long-term practices. It will look at the advances in biological, biomedical, and pharmaceutical technologies as they apply to the Army. The study will also analyze trends in the broader area of human enhancement for relevant application to future force capabilities, and consider individual, organizational, and cultural risks of application within the military. Finally, it may consider whether and how cultural values of foreign nations may facilitate the development and application of enhancements that the U.S. Government would see as more extreme or unethical.

Start Further Info FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Don Hagen at 703-605-6142, or by email at dhagen@ntis.gov . End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction/Background NTIS, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is seeking proposals from potential joint venture partners (JVPs) that can work with NTIS to assist Federal agencies to improve access, data interoperability, search, or use of Federal data and data services to drive innovation and business outcome. Activities conducted by joint ventures may include: (1) Designing, testing, analyzing, or demonstrating the application of Federal data and data services, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data; (2) leveraging the private sector's knowledge and expertise in managing data and data sets, including data collection by the Federal government; (3) facilitating the creation, based on Federal data or the use of Federal data in some combination with non-Federal data, of suites of products, platforms, and services that meet the needs of businesses, innovators, government agencies, and others; or (4) otherwise enhancing data discovery and usability, data interoperability and standards, data analytics and forecasting, or data infrastructure and security. These activities support several federal priorities for the Data Economy such as Big Data, Open Data, Open Access, Cyber-Physical Systems, Smart Cities, and Internet-of-Things. The business opportunities described in this notice are joint ventures, which require investments by partners and may provide a revenue-sharing opportunity. NTIS has statutory authority to operate as a permanent clearinghouse of scientific, technical, and engineering information and to collect and disseminate such information, codified in chapter 23 of title 15 of the United States Code ( 15 U.S.C. 1151 -1157), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1152 . Section 1153 of this chapter provides NTIS' authority to charge fees for its products and services and to recover all costs through such fees to the fullest extent feasible. The authority was restated and expanded in the National Technical Information Act of 1988, codified at 15 U.S.C. 3704 b. This act gave NTIS the authority to enter into joint ventures and declared the clearinghouse to be a permanent federal function that could not be eliminated or privatized without Congressional approval. The National Technical Information Act of 1988 was amended by the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-245), which directed NTIS to focus on developing new electronic methods and media for information dissemination. In addition, following a rigorous review of NTIS mission and operations, the Secretary of Commerce set a new strategic direction for NTIS in May 2015 that will meet a 21st Century national need: To promote the Commerce Department's and Federal data priorities, including Open Access and Open Data. The new strategic direction for NTIS is aligned with the Commerce Department's Data Goal, which is one of five goals in the Department's Strategic Plan. The Department collects, stores, and analyzes a wealth of information, including data on the Nation's economy, population, and environment. These data are at the core of the Department's mission, and are used to protect life and property and to grow the economy. Businesses use the Department's data to make investment and hiring decisions. State and local governments mine the Department's data to warn of coming danger, position first-responders, and construct high-tech classrooms. The Federal Government uses the Department's data to allocate funds and to make critical decisions on fiscal and monetary policy. As America's Data Agency, [ 1 ] the Department of Commerce is using its data to spur innovation inside and outside the Federal Government and promote greater prosperity across the country. The potential economic value of Federal Government data is significant. In a 2014 report, [ 2 ] the Department of Commerce's Economics and Statistics Administration estimated that Federal Government data have the potential to guide up to $3.3 trillion in investments in the United States annually. The report estimated that the Decennial Census and American Community Survey data alone guide $400 billion in federal spending annually. The report also states that 28 Federal Government programs which distribute more than $300 billion annually use regional income and product estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, derived from Department data. Further the report finds that government data-intensive private firms generate annual revenues with an upper estimate as high as $221 billion. There are different data types, standards, methodologies, Web sites, architectures, platforms, and formats that make it difficult to access, analyze, and use data. Few people know the extent of Commerce's or other Federal Government data sets, and even fewer know how to build innovative, useful tools from them. Partnering with the private sector will allow NTIS to leverage industry knowledge and expertise in delivering data to end users. Joint venture partnerships will also increase the capacity of NTIS to develop and disseminate data in common standards and architectures that will make it easier for the public to access, analyze, and use the data, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data. It is at the intersection between the Federal agencies and the private sector where NTIS will deliver exceptional value by serving as a center of excellence in meeting a 21st Century national need. NTIS may enter into Joint Ventures to enable partnerships involving the Commerce Department or its Bureaus, or other Federal agencies. Start Printed Page 39027 Specifically, NTIS will accelerate (1) private sector use of government data, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data, to develop and use new and improved data products and services, and (2) government use of data to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs. NTIS will remain a self-supporting agency without federal appropriations that recovers its operating costs from fees and the use of the NTIS Revolving Fund. 15 U.S.C. 1153 and 3704b note. II. General Scope Technical Requirements Proposals must address at least one of the following areas of innovation. The proposer must explicitly state in the proposal which area(s) are addressed. 1. Providing innovations in the use of data and data services. The proposal must include a description of how the proposer would contribute innovations in the use of data and data services and the resources, such as staff, partnerships, contracts, other technologies, they would use to achieve these innovations. The proposal should also provide examples of prior instances of similar innovative work conducted by the proposer. The scope of this area includes data science and engineering innovations associated with (a) making it easier to use data, and (b) combining, analyzing and using data, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data, in new ways, and (c) data infrastructure and security such as advancements for data inventories, data capture, cloud-based data solutions, cybersecurity, and assistive technologies. 2. Providing new, more effective and/or efficient methods for sharing data. The proposal must include a description of how the proposer would improve data sharing and provide examples where applicable. The proposal must include a description of the resources, such as staff, partnerships, contracts, and other technologies, the proposer would use to achieve these innovations. The scope of this area includes data science and engineering innovations associated with (a) data discovery and usability such as search engine optimization, interactive visualization and query management, and user analytics, (b) data interoperability and standards such as data cleansing, metadata practices, application programming interfaces, and developer platforms, and (c) simplifying and streamlining delivery of data services. 3. Advancing ways to analyze, interpret, and understand data as well as apply it in meaningful ways. The proposal must describe how the proposer would use technologies, processes and techniques to improve the analysis, interpretation, understanding, and application of data and provide examples where applicable. The proposal must include a description of the resources, such as staff, partnerships, contracts, and other technologies, the proposer would use to achieve these innovations. The scope of this area includes data science and engineering innovations associated with data analytics and forecasting such as data visualization, geospatial analysis, comparative and predictive analytics, and statistical methods. 4. Developing technologies, techniques, and processes that can lead to deep understanding from and new insights into data. The proposal must include a description of how the proposer would significantly improve the value of data, how such deep understanding and new insights may be applied and the potential benefits and impacts of these innovations. The proposal must include a description of the resources, such as staff, partnerships, subcontracts, and other technologies, the proposer would use to achieve these innovations. The scope of this area includes data science and engineering innovations associated with data analytics and forecasting such as machine learning, cognitive analytics, artificial intelligence, and other computer science advancements. The proposal may focus on data from the Federal Government alone, or in combination with non-Federal data. NTIS pursues joint ventures as a means of improving access to, or analysis, collection, or use of Federal data and data services, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data, that can be best developed and delivered through the combined resources of NTIS and one or more joint venture partners. The NTIS joint venture program is focused on (1) making it easier to collect, access, analyze, and use data; (2) combining and using data in new ways; (3) leveraging advances in data science, software development, and standards; and (4) simplifying and streamlining delivery of data services. NTIS joint venture projects involve innovation, speedy execution, and one or more of the following attributes: (a) First or early use of emerging technology, (b) complexity of solution architecture, interoperability, and/or security; (c) agile applications development and systems operations which require adaptive scoping; and/or (d) custom solutions to meet unique requirements without commercial-off-the-shelf solutions. The NTIS joint venture partnership program enables NTIS to structure joint venture partnership agreements and Federal agency agreements that offer the best combination of speed and performance for delivering innovative data services or systems. NTIS manages joint venture projects in a highly flexible, interactive, and collaborative manner with its customer Federal agencies and joint venture partners. As NTIS operates on a cost-recovery basis, proposals should address proposed business terms for revenue sharing between NTIS and the proposed joint venture partner. Proposals should demonstrate the benefits of collaboration between the proposed joint venture partner and NTIS. Joint ventures are not procurements and do not result in contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Joint ventures involve the investment of resources by NTIS and its partners, with a formal agreement for the sharing of resources associated within the venture. Both the joint venture partner and NTIS will share opportunities for potential returns in the form of revenue from projects with other Federal agencies. NTIS envisions separate joint venture partnership(s) with multiple organizations. The joint venture partnership(s) will provide data services that allow customer federal agencies to further their missions rapidly in innovative and creative ways by enabling businesses, government agencies, and the public to access, analyze, collect, synthesize, disseminate, or use data. NTIS will provide data services that support the development of solutions with its joint venture partners. NTIS will also provide technical guidance and oversight for joint venture partnerships. NTIS will enter into joint venture agreements in accordance with all relevant provisions of applicable federal laws. Any proposal that has the appearance of circumventing FAR or other agency acquisition requirements will be determined to be non-responsive to this Opportunity Announcement during the initial phase of the selection process and will not be considered further. Proposers must acknowledge and address the following in their proposals: Data received from a Federal agency and from non-Federal organizations as part of a project performed by NTIS with a joint venture partner may only be accessed and utilized for project purposes consistent with all applicable statutory and regulatory protections and all relevant agreements. Start Printed Page 39028 Federal agencies and private sector organizations that provide data as part of a project performed by NTIS with a joint venture partner will retain ownership of the data rights. Federal agencies and private sector organizations may be requested to provide licenses to use the data for the purposes of a project. Systems, programs and applications included in the proposal must comply with the documented security assessment and authorization (A&A) policies issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), standards and guidance issued by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) before the systems, programs and applications are offered to Federal agencies under a joint venture partnership. Proposers must have the ability to accept electronic fund transfers. NTIS will not guarantee that any revenue will be generated for the joint venture partner merely by entering into a joint venture partnership with NTIS. Proposers must have the ability to fund their portion of any projects commenced pursuant to a joint venture partnership agreement for a period of time, which may differ on individual projects, due to federal accrual accounting practices. NTIS does not allow (and has never offered) financial incentives in entering into joint venture partnership agreements. NTIS will not provide advance payments to joint venture partners. III. Requested Response NTIS seeks to enter into joint venture partnerships with one or more partners to assist Federal agencies further their missions in innovative and creative ways by enabling businesses, government agencies, and the public with improved access to, or analysis, collection, or use of Federal data and data services, either alone or in combination with non-Federal data. NTIS provides data services for speedy execution of innovative projects, typically involving one or more of the following attributes: (a) First or early use of emerging technology; (b) complexity of solution architecture, interoperability, and/or security; (c) agile applications development and systems operations which require adaptive scoping; or (d) custom solutions to meet unique requirements without commercial-off-the-shelf solutions. Proposers are encouraged to include proposed teams of more than one private sector organization, including small and medium enterprises and start-ups. Proposals should describe any proposed teaming arrangements, including the relationships among the parties, how the team would function, and how the team may be augmented to fill missing capabilities. NTIS will evaluate each proposal and may solicit oral presentations from some or all proposers. Upon entering into a JVP agreement, NTIS expects the proposed services to be available solely to Federal agencies and only through agreements between NTIS and the customer Federal agencies.

S"Start Preamble AGENCY: Bureau of Industry and Security, Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding forty-four persons under forty-nine entries to the Entity List. The forty-four persons who are added to the Entity List have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. These forty-four persons will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). This final rule also removes five entities from the Entity List under the destinations of Ukraine and the U.A.E., as the result of requests for removal received by BIS, a review of information provided in the removal requests in accordance with the procedure for requesting removal or modification of an Entity List entity and further review conducted by the End-User Review Committee (ERC). Finally, this final rule modifies two existing entries in the Entity List, both under the destination of China. These entries are being modified to reflect additional aliases and addresses for these persons. BIS implements this rule to protect U.S. national security or foreign policy interests and to ensure entries on the Entity List are accurate and up-to-date. DATES: This rule is effective March 21, 2016. Start Further Info FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chair, End-User Review Committee, Office of the Assistant Secretary, Export Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, Phone: (202) 482-5991, Fax: (202) 482-3911, Email: ERC@bis.doc.gov . End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Entity List (Supplement No. 4 to part 744) identifies entities and other persons reasonably believed to be involved, or to pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The EAR imposes additional license requirements on, and limits the availability of most license exceptions for, exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to those listed. The license review policy for each listed entity or other person is identified in the License Review Policy column on the Entity List and the impact on the availability of license exceptions is described in the Federal Register notice adding entities or other persons to the Entity List. BIS places entities and other persons on the Entity List pursuant to sections of part 744 (Control Policy: End-User and End-Use Based) and part 746 (Embargoes and Other Special Controls) of the EAR. The ERC, composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, where appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the Entity List. The ERC makes all decisions to add an entry to the Entity List by majority vote and all decisions to remove or modify an entry by unanimous vote. ERC Entity List Decisions Additions to the Entity List This rule implements the decision of the ERC to add forty-four persons under forty-nine entries to the Entity List. These forty-four persons are being added on the basis of 744.11 (License requirements that apply to entities acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States) of the EAR. The forty-nine entries added to the entity list consist of eight entries in China, four entries in Germany, three entries in Hong Kong, one entry in India, two entries in Iran, five entries in Malaysia, two entries in the Netherlands, one entry in Singapore, one entry in Switzerland and twenty-two entries in the U.A.E. There are forty-nine entries for the forty-four persons because four persons are listed in multiple locations, resulting in five additional entries. Start Printed Page 14954 The ERC reviewed 744.11(b) (Criteria for revising the Entity List) in making the determination to add these forty-four persons under forty-nine entries to the Entity List. Under that paragraph, persons for whom there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that they have been involved, are involved, or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in, activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and those acting on behalf of such persons may be added to the Entity List. Paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of 744.11 include an illustrative list of activities that could be contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Pursuant to 744.11 of the EAR, the ERC determined that forty-four persons, located in the destinations of China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Malaysia, Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.A.E., be added to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Specifically, the ERC determined that Frank Genin, Skylinks FZC, All Industrial International, Beaumont Trading AG, Behover General Trading/Information Technologies, Complete Freight Solutions, Cybernet MEA, Innovative Technology Solutions, Joinus Freight Systems HK Ltd, Syarikat Penghantaran TWW Sdn Bhd, Teofila Logistics, Amanda Sng, Beverly Apigo, Rose Ann Apigo, Hamideh Ghayour, Kapil Raj Arora, Mehdi Jafariyeh, T.V. Joe Ouseppachan, and Donna Lynn Ocampo be added to the Entity List on the basis of their attempts to procure items, including U.S.-origin items, for activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. Specifically, Frank Genin used the aforementioned companies and employees thereof to supply U.S.-origin items to an Iranian party associated with the Iranian defense industry. Additionally, two Skylinks managing directors, Seyed Amin Ghorashi Sarvestani and Peyman Manoucher Azimi were convicted in the United States in 2013 for International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) violations carried out through Skylinks and its parent company, Innovative Technology Systems (ITS). Three of these entities (Beaumont Trading AG, Frank Genin, and Skylinks FZC) are located in multiple locations, resulting in a total of twenty-three entries added under the destinations of Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.A.E. The ERC determined that Industrio GmbH, Peter Duenker, Martin Hess and Wilhelm Bill Holler attempted to procure items, including U.S.-origin items, for activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. Specifically, Industrio GmbH and its associates have been involved in supplying U.S.-origin items to an Iranian party associated with the Iranian defense industry. The Iranian party's customers include companies designated by the Department of the Treasury as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs). Pursuant to 744.11(b) of the EAR, the ERC determined that the conduct of these twenty-three entities raises sufficient concern that prior review of exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR involving these persons, and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denials on shipments to the persons, will enhance BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR. In addition, the ERC determined that that there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that Mahmood Akbari; Reza Hajigholamali; Patco Group Ltd.; Managed Systems and Services (MSAS)(FZC); and TGO General Trading LLC were involved in the illegal diversion of U.S.-origin items to Iran via the U.A.E. One of these persons (Reza Hajigholamali) is located in both Iran and the U.A.E., resulting in six entries added under the locations of Iran and the U.A.E. The ERC also determined that for eight entities located in ChinaJereh International; Jinan Tongbaolai Oilfield Equipment Co. Ltd.; Yantai Jereh Oilfield Services Group Co., Ltd.; Chen Qu; Edward Fan; Gala Wang; Sharon Yang; and Tan Weithere is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that they unlawfully diverted U.S.-origin oilfield equipment to Iran without the required Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licenses, actions that violate the EAR. Pursuant to 744.11(b)(2) of the EAR, the ERC determined that the conduct of these thirteen entities raises sufficient concern that prior review of exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR involving these persons, and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denials on shipments to the persons, will enhance BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR. Therefore, these thirteen entities are being added to the Entity List. The ERC determined that four entities, EEZ SDN, Mohamad Sadeghi, Mohsen Torabi, and Muhamad Fazil bin Khalid, be added to the Entity List under Malaysia. These persons are involved, or have previously been involved, in an illicit procurement scheme to divert items subject to the EAR to prohibited end uses and end users in Iran. The actions of these persons have supported persons engaged in acts of terror and enhanced the military capability of Iran, which has been designated by the Secretary of State as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. Pursuant to 744.11(b)(1), (2) and (5) of the EAR, the ERC determined that the conduct of these four entities raises sufficient concern that prior review of exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR involving these persons, and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denials on shipments to the persons, will enhance BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR. Finally, the ERC determined that four entities located in the U.A.E., AdCom Systems, Advanced Targeting Systems Company, LLC (ATS), Gulf Eagle Contracting (GEC), and Gulf Eagle Industrial and Metal Profiles (GEIMP), be added to the Entity List. AdCom Systems and its three affiliated companies are seeking to export Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Category I unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to non-MTCR member countries. All Category I systems are inherently capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction, and the proliferation of such systems by AdCom and its affiliates undermines the international missile nonproliferation objectives that the United States relies on to promote its national security and foreign policy interests. Pursuant to 744.11(b) of the EAR, the ERC determined that the conduct of these four entities raises sufficient concern that prior review of exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR involving these persons, and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denials on shipments to the persons, will enhance BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR. For the forty-four persons under forty-nine entries added to the Entity List, BIS imposes a license requirement for all items subject to the EAR and a license review policy of presumption of denial. The license requirements apply to any transaction in which items are to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to any of the persons or in which such persons act as purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, or end-user. In addition, no Start Printed Page 14955 license exceptions are available for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to the persons being added to the Entity List in this rule. The acronym a.k.a. (also known as) is used in entries on the Entity List to help exporters, reexporters and transferors to better identify listed persons on the Entity List.

Pursuant to 744.11(b)(5) of the EAR, Ukrspetsexport was found to have exported military equipment to a country on the State Department's State Sponsors of Terrorism List and was subsequently added to the Entity List on March 28, 2013 ( 78 FR 18811 ). The ERC's decision to remove this entry from the Entity List was based on information received by the BIS and further review conducted by the ERC. Zener One Net, Zener Marine, Ivan Desouza, and Girish Purushotham were added to the Entity List on June 5, 2014 ( 79 FR 32441 ), pursuant to 744.11(b)(1) of the EAR. The removal of Zener One Net, Zener Marine, Ivan Desouza, and Girish Purushotham is based on the information provided in their appeal request, information provided by the companies and persons in cooperative exchanges, and further reviews conducted by the ERC. In accordance with 744.16(c), the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration has sent written notifications informing these persons of the ERC's decisions to remove them from the Entity List. This final rule implements the decision to remove the following five entities located in the Ukraine and the U.A.E. from the Entity List. Ukraine (1) Ukrspetsexport, 36 Degtiarivska Blvd., Ukraine 04119 Kyiv. United Arab Emirates (1) Girish Purushothama, P.O. Box 389, Dubai, U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 3905, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E.; and Plot S20206, Dubai, U.A.E.; (2) Ivan Desouza, a.k.a., the following one alias: Ivan D'Souza, P.O. Box 389, Start Printed Page 14957 Dubai, U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 3905, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E.; and Plot S20206, Dubai, U.A.E.; (3) Zener Marine, P.O. Box 389, Dubai, U.A.E.; and Al Quoz Warehouse, Dubai, U.A.E.; and (4) Zener One Net, P.O. Box 389, Dubai, U.A.E. The removal of the five persons referenced above, which was approved by the ERC, eliminates the existing license requirements in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 for exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) to these entities. However, the removal of these five persons from the Entity List does not relieve persons of other obligations under part 744 of the EAR or under other parts of the EAR. Neither the removal of an entity from the Entity List nor the removal of Entity List-based license requirements relieves persons of their obligations under General Prohibition 5 in 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR which provides that, you may not, without a license, knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user or end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR. Additionally, these removals do not relieve persons of their obligation to apply for export, reexport or in-country transfer licenses required by other provisions of the EAR. BIS strongly urges the use of Supplement No. 3 to part 732 of the EAR, BIS's `Know Your Customer' Guidance and Red Flags, when persons are involved in transactions that are subject to the EAR. Modifications to the Entity List This final rule implements the decision of the ERC to modify two existing entries on the Entity List, under the destination of China. The ERC made determinations to make the following modifications: Add one alias and three additional addresses to the entry of Chengdu GaStone Technology Co., Ltd. (CGTC) and add four aliases and nine additional addresses to the entry of PRC Lode Technology Company. This final rule makes the following modifications to two entries on the Entity list: China (1) Chengdu GaStone Technology Co., Ltd. (CGTC), a.k.a., the following one alias: Chengdu Jiashi Technology Co., 31F, A Tower, Yanlord Square, No. 1, Section 2, Renmind South Road, Chengdu China; and Internet of Things Industrial Park Economic Development District Xinan Hangkonggang (Southwest Airport), Shuangliu County, Chengdu; and 29th Floor, Yanlord Landmark, No. 1 Renmin South Road Section 2, Chengdu; and 29/F Yanlord Landmark Tower A, Chengdu, China; and (2) PRC Lode Technology Company, a.k.a., the following the following four aliases: Lode Technology Company; Beijing Lode Technology Company, Ltd.; Beijing Nuodian Keji Youxian Gongsi; and Beijing Nuodian Technology. Room 8306 Kelun Building, 12A Guanghua Road, Chaoyang, Beijing 100020, China; and Room 801, Unit 1, Building 8 Caiman Street, Chaoyang Road, Beijing 100025, China; and Building 1-1, No. 67 Caiman Str., Chaoyang Road, Beijing 100123, China; and Room A407 Kelun Building, 12A Guanghua Road, Chaoyang, Beijing 100020, China; and Rm 602, 5/F, No. 106 NanHu Road, ChaoYang District, Beijing, China; and Suite 801, Unit 1, Building 8 Caiman Street Finance & Economics Center, Chaoyang Road, Chaoyang Disrict, Beijing; and Suite 306, Lianhua Building No. 159 Tianzhou Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai 200233; and Suite 6B3, Building 15, No. 300 Tianlin Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai 200233; and Suite 1901, Unit 1, Block 8, District E, Ziwei Garden City, Chang'an Technological Garden, Xi'an, 710119; and Suite 2002, Unit 4, Building 1 Zhongda Junyue Jinsha Phase 3 No. 15 Jinxiang Road, Qingyang District, Chengdu, 610031; and Suite 1506, Building 4, Dachengxiaoshi, No. 10 Qingjiang Zhong Road, Qingyang District, Chengdu, 610072; and Suite 904, Building A6, Shunfeng Emerald Garden, No. 168 Zhaofeng Road, Shijing, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, 510410; and No. 1263 Airport Road, Baiyun District, Guangzhou; and Suite 201, Tower A, Building 14, Qianxihe Garden Center, Nanchang, 330002 (See alternate addresses under Hong Kong). Savings Clause Shipments of items removed from eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR) as a result of this regulatory action that were en route aboard a carrier to a port of export or reexport, on March 21, 2016, pursuant to actual orders for export or reexport to a foreign destination, may proceed to that destination under the previous eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR). Export Administration Act Although the Export Administration Act expired on August 20, 2001, the President, through Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783 (2002), as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013, 78 FR 16129 (March 13, 2013) and as extended by the Notice of August 7, 2015, 80 FR 48233 (August 11, 2015), has continued the Export Administration Regulations in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. BIS continues to carry out the provisions of the Export Administration Act, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, pursuant to Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 . Rulemaking Requirements 1. Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to nor be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ( 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This regulation involves collections previously approved by OMB under control number 0694-0088, Simplified Network Application Processing System, which includes, among other things, license applications and carries a burden estimate of 43.8 minutes for a manual or electronic submission. Total burden hours associated with the PRA and OMB control number 0694-0088 are not expected to increase as a result of this rule. You may send comments regarding the collection of information associated with this rule, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Jasmeet K. Seehra, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by email to Jasmeet_K._Seehra@omb.eop.gov , or by fax to (202) 395-7285. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined in Executive Order 13132 . 4. For the forty-four persons under forty-nine entries added to the Entity List in this final rule, the provisions of Start Printed Page 14958 the Administrative Procedure Act ( 5 U.S.C. 553 ) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment and a delay in effective date are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. (See 5 U.S.C. 553 (a)(1)). BIS implements this rule to protect U.S. national security or foreign policy interests by preventing items from being exported, reexported, or transferred (in country) to the persons being added to the Entity List. If this rule were delayed to allow for notice and comment and a delay in effective date, the entities being added to the Entity List by this action would continue to be able to receive items without a license and to conduct activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. In addition, publishing a proposed rule would give these parties notice of the U.S. Government's intention to place them on the Entity List and would create an incentive for these persons to either accelerate receiving items subject to the EAR to conduct activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, and/or to take steps to set up additional aliases, change addresses, and other measures to try to limit the impact of the listing on the Entity List once a final rule was published. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553 , or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared. 5. For the five entries removed from the Entity List in this final rule, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B), BIS finds good cause to waive requirements that this rule be subject to notice and the opportunity for public comment because it would be contrary to the public interest. In determining whether to grant removal requests from the Entity List, a committee of U.S. Government agencies (the End-User Review Committee (ERC)) evaluates information about and commitments made by listed persons requesting removal from the Entity List, the nature and terms of which are set forth in 15 CFR part 744 , Supplement No. 5, as noted in 15 CFR 744.16 (b). The information, commitments, and criteria for this extensive review were all established through the notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment process ( 72 FR 31005 (June 5, 2007) (proposed rule), and 73 FR 49311 (August 21, 2008) (final rule)). These five removals have been made within the established regulatory framework of the Entity List. If the rule were to be delayed to allow for public comment, U.S. exporters may face unnecessary economic losses as they turn away potential sales to the other entity removed by this rule because the customer remained a listed person on the Entity List even after the ERC approved the removal pursuant to the rule published at 73 FR 49311 on August 21, 2008. By publishing without prior notice and comment, BIS allows the applicant to receive U.S. exports immediately since the applicant already has received approval by the ERC pursuant to 15 CFR part 744 , Supplement No. 5, as noted in 15 CFR 744.16 (b). The removals from the Entity List granted by the ERC involve interagency deliberation and result from review of public and non-public sources, including sensitive law enforcement information and classified information, and the measurement of such information against the Entity List removal criteria. This information is extensively reviewed according to the criteria for evaluating removal requests from the Entity List, as set out in 15 CFR part 744 , Supplement No. 5 and 15 CFR 744.16 (b). For reasons of national security, BIS is not at liberty to provide to the public detailed information on which the ERC relied to make the decisions to remove these five entities. In addition, the information included in the removal request is information exchanged between the applicant and the ERC, which by law (section 12(c) of the Export Administration Act), BIS is restricted from sharing with the public. Moreover, removal requests from the Entity List contain confidential business information, which is necessary for the extensive review conducted by the U.S. Government in assessing such removal requests. Section 553(d) of the APA generally provides that rules may not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after they are published in the Federal Register . BIS finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness under 5 U.S.C. 553 (d)(1) because this rule is a substantive rule which relieves a restriction. This rule's removal of five persons under five entries from the Entity List removes a requirement (the Entity-List-based license requirement and limitation on use of license exceptions) on these five persons being removed from the Entity List. The rule does not impose a requirement on any other person for these five removals from the Entity List. No other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this final rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required under the APA or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act ( 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) are not applicable. As a result, no final regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.

VThis rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding forty-four persons under forty-nine entries to the Entity List. The forty-four persons who are added to the Entity List have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. These forty- four persons will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). This final rule also removes five entities from the Entity List under the destinations of Ukraine and the U.A.E., as the result of requests for removal received by BIS, a review of information provided in the removal requests in accordance with the procedure for requesting removal or modification of an Entity List entity and further review conducted by the End-User Review Committee (ERC). Finally, this final rule modifies two existing entries in the Entity List, both under the destination of China. These entries are being modified to reflect additional aliases and addresses for these persons. BIS implements this rule to protect U.S. national security or foreign policy interests and to ensure entries on the Entity List are accurate and up-to-date.

S"Start Preamble AGENCY: International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA) is organizing an Executive-led Smart Cities Infrastructure Business Development Mission to India (New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, with an optional spin off site visit to Vizag) from February 8-12, 2016. Today, India's cities account for approximately 60% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By 2030, that share is expected to reach 75% and the urban labor force is expected to increase by nearly 200 million workers. The new Indian Government led by Prime Minister Modi assumed office in June 2014 with an overwhelming mandate to focus on economic development. To capture the popular imagination and motivate the people of India, the new government has proposed a dramatic nationwide program to build 100 smart cities. In practice this will mean a wide variety of major infrastructure projects across the country that will be funded by the central and state governments over the next few years along with private sector capital. Infrastructure needs in India are estimated to be in the $1.5-$2 trillion range. The recently launched initiative Start Printed Page 46244 will move to define and implement reforms that drive the growth of smart cities. At this stage, the government has highlighted resource management, 24 hour water and power supply, world class transportation systems, state of the art education systems, advanced e-government, and environmental sustainability as pillars of India's smart cities. This initiative offers excellent opportunities for U.S. companies to participate in these projects in selected areas and sectors. In recognition of cutting-edge U.S. technologies, products and services, the Government of India is encouraging the U.S. Government (USG) and U.S. companies to take the lead in developing smart city projects in three major urban areas: Ajmer in the state of Rajasthan, Allahabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Vishakhapatnam (aka Vizag) in the state of Andhra Pradesh. With the support of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, U.S. companies will be involved in planning and technical assistance for each of these cities. However, U.S. participation is not limited to these three cities. CS India, in partnership with the American Chamber of Commerce and other local commercial chambers, has been staging events throughout the country in cities with additional public and private smart city projects. Schedule Day of week Date Activity Sunday Feb. 7 Participants arrive in Delhi. Monday Feb. 8 Country briefing by U.S. Embassy staff on programs and opportunities in the infrastructure sector. B-2-B Business Meetings for delegates in New Delhi. \n               Evening Reception. Tuesday Feb. 9 Government meetings.

Friday Feb. 12 Optional smart city site visit to Vizag.* Return to the United States on own itinerary. *Vizag (aka Vishakhapatnam) has made the most progress in terms of planning for physical infrastructure upgrades and implementation of smart city technologies. Additionally, the US Trade and Development Agency recently awarded a master planning contract to a consortium of US companies to facilitate smart city implementation in Vizag. A spin off visit to Vizag will provide an opportunity for mission participants to visit an up and coming smart city in India and to market their technologies directly to decision makers in Vizag as well as to the US consortium that has the master planning contract.
