Because KCATA may decide to seek FTA New Starts funding for transit improvements in the corridor, this work will also satisfy the FTA requirement for an Alternatives Analysis through the development of a combined Alternatives Analysis/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (AA/DEIS). Possible transit improvements in the corridor are intended to improve access to the major employment center located in the central portion of the region, especially for that segment of the population that does not have access to the auto-oriented transportation system. Additionally, new transit facilities would support sustainable development patterns in the corridor. Alternatives proposed to be considered for accomplishing these purposes include (1) The Future No- Build Alternative, (2) a Transportation System Management (TSM) alternative that includes improvements to bus services, and (3) various fixed-guideway transit alternatives, including the light rail transit (LRT) line developed by the Citizens' Light Rail Task Force. Scoping of the EIS will be accomplished through meetings and correspondence with interested individuals, organizations, Federal, State, and local governmental agencies, and Native American tribes.","document_number":"E8-1510","html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/01/30/E8-1510/preparation-of-an-environmental-impact-statement-on-transit-improvements-in-the-north-south-corridor","pdf_url":"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2008-01-30/pdf/E8-1510.pdf","public_inspection_pdf_url":null,"publication_date":"2008-01-30","agencies":[{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","name":"Transportation Department","id":492,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json","parent_id":null,"slug":"transportation-department"},{"raw_name":"Federal Transit Administration","name":"Federal Transit Administration","id":193,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/federal-transit-administration","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/193.json","parent_id":492,"slug":"federal-transit-administration"}],"excerpts":" &#8230; , new transit facilities would support <span class=\"match\">sustainable</span> <span class=\"match\">development</span> patterns in the corridor.

ETTAC will also be briefed on current World Trade Organization issues including an update on responses to the Office of Environmental Technologies Industries' (ETI) Survey of Non-Tariff Barriers to trade in environmental technologies. The meeting is open to the public. ETTAC is mandated by Public Law 103-392. It was created to advise the U.S. government on environmental trade policies and programs, and to help it to focus its resources on increasing the exports of the U.S. environmental industry. The ETTAC operates as an advisory committee to the Secretary of Commerce and the interagency Environmental Trade Working Group (ETWG) of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). The ETTAC was originally chartered in May of 1994. It was most recently rechartered until May 30, 2002.

On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum requesting that NHTSA and EPA develop through notice and comment rulemaking a coordinated National Program to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions of light-duty vehicles for model years 2017-2025, building on the success of the first phase of the National Program for these vehicles for model years 2012-2016. This final rule, consistent with the President's request, responds to the country's critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption. NHTSA is finalizing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for model years 2017-2021 and issuing augural standards for model years 2022-2025 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act. NHTSA will set final standards for model years 2022-2025 in a future rulemaking. EPA is finalizing greenhouse gas emissions standards for model years 2017- 2025 under the Clean Air Act. These standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, and represent the continuation of a harmonized and consistent National Program. Under the National Program automobile manufacturers will be able to continue building a single light-duty national fleet that satisfies all requirements under both programs while ensuring that consumers still have a full range of vehicle choices that are available today. EPA is also finalizing minor changes to the regulations applicable to model years 2012-2016, with respect to air conditioner performance, nitrous oxides measurement, off-cycle technology credits, and police and emergency vehicles.","document_number":"2012-21972","html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/10/15/2012-21972/2017-and-later-model-year-light-duty-vehicle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-corporate-average-fuel","pdf_url":"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-15/pdf/2012-21972.pdf","public_inspection_pdf_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-21972.pdf?1350046732","publication_date":"2012-10-15","agencies":[{"raw_name":"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY","name":"Environmental Protection Agency","id":145,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json","parent_id":null,"slug":"environmental-protection-agency"},{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","name":"Transportation Department","id":492,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json","parent_id":null,"slug":"transportation-department"},{"raw_name":"National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","name":"National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","id":345,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/345.json","parent_id":492,"slug":"national-highway-traffic-safety-administration"}],"excerpts":" &#8230; , the Institute for Governance &amp; <span class=\"match\">Sustainable</span> <span class=\"match\">Development</span> (IGSD), and the Environmental Investigation &#8230; "},{"title":"Announcement of the Award of Two Single-Source Program Expansion Supplements to Grantees Under the Pathways to Responsible Fatherhood Grants","type":"Notice","abstract":"The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family Assistance (OFA), Division of State and Territory TANF Management (DSTTM) announces the award of single-source program expansion supplement grants of $131,666 each to Kanawha Institute for Social Research & Action (KISRA) in Dunbar, WV, and Connections to Success in Kansas City, MO.
