"Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on Transit Improvements in the North-South Corridor of Kansas City, MO",Notice,Transportation Department; Federal Transit Administration,"The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to assess the environmental and community impacts of transit improvements proposed by KCATA and the City of Kansas City, Missouri in a 12-mile North/South travel corridor in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Because KCATA may decide to seek FTA New Starts funding for transit improvements in the corridor, this work will also satisfy the FTA requirement for an Alternatives Analysis through the development of a combined Alternatives Analysis/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (AA/DEIS). Possible transit improvements in the corridor are intended to improve access to the major employment center located in the central portion of the region, especially for that segment of the population that does not have access to the auto-oriented transportation system. Additionally, new transit facilities would support sustainable development patterns in the corridor. Alternatives proposed to be considered for accomplishing these purposes include (1) The Future No- Build Alternative, (2) a Transportation System Management (TSM) alternative that includes improvements to bus services, and (3) various fixed-guideway transit alternatives, including the light rail transit (LRT) line developed by the Citizens' Light Rail Task Force. Scoping of the EIS will be accomplished through meetings and correspondence with interested individuals, organizations, Federal, State, and local governmental agencies, and Native American tribes.", E8-1510,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/01/30/E8-1510/preparation-of-an-environmental-impact-statement-on-transit-improvements-in-the-north-south-corridor,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2008-01-30/pdf/E8-1510.pdf,01/30/2008

We divide the globally listed endangered species into 14 distinct population segments (DPS), remove the current species-level listing, and in its place list four DPSs as endangered and one DPS as threatened. Based on their current statuses, the remaining nine DPSs do not warrant listing.

The changes reflect the passage of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The MAP-21 continues many provisions related to transportation planning from prior laws; however, it introduces transformational changes and adds some new provisions. The FAST Act makes minor edits to existing provisions. The changes make the regulations consistent with current statutory requirements and implement the following: A new mandate for State departments of transportation (hereafter referred to simply as ``States'') and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) to take a performance-based approach to planning and programming; a new emphasis on the nonmetropolitan transportation planning process, by requiring States to have a higher level of involvement with nonmetropolitan local officials and providing a process for the creation of regional transportation planning organizations (RTPO); a structural change to the membership of the larger MPOs; a new framework for voluntary scenario planning; new authority for the integration of the planning and environmental review processes; and a process for programmatic mitigation plans.", 2016-11964,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/27/2016-11964/statewide-and-nonmetropolitan-transportation-planning-metropolitan-transportation-planning,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11964.pdf,05/27/2016

2017 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency; Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are issuing this joint proposal to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017-2025. This proposal extends the National Program beyond the greenhouse gas and corporate average fuel economy standards set for model years 2012-2016. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum requesting that NHTSA and EPA develop through notice and comment rulemaking a coordinated National Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of light-duty vehicles for model years 2017- 2025. This proposal, consistent with the President's request, responds to the country's critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption. NHTSA is proposing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act, and EPA is proposing greenhouse gas emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. These standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium- duty passenger vehicles, and represent a continued harmonized and consistent National Program. Under the National Program for model years 2017-2025, automobile manufacturers would be able to continue building a single light-duty national fleet that satisfies all requirements under both programs while ensuring that consumers still have a full range of vehicle choices. EPA is also proposing a minor change to the regulations applicable to MY 2012-2016, with respect to air conditioner performance and measurement of nitrous oxides.", 2011-30358,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/12/01/2011-30358/2017-and-later-model-year-light-duty-vehicle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-corporate-average-fuel,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-12-01/pdf/2011-30358.pdf,12/01/2011

Endangered and Threatened Species; Proposed Threatened Status for Subspecies of the Ringed Seal,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review of the ringed seal (Phoca hispida) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the ringed seal as a threatened or endangered species. Based on consideration of information presented in the status review report, an assessment of the factors in the ESA, and efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined the Arctic (Phoca hispida hispida), Okhotsk (Phoca hispida ochotensis), Baltic (Phoca hispida botnica), and Ladoga (Phoca hispida ladogensis) subspecies of the ringed seal are likely to become endangered throughout all or a significant portion of their range in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we issue a proposed rule to list these subspecies of the ringed seal as threatened species, and we solicit comments on this proposed action. At this time, we do not propose to designate critical habitat for the Arctic ringed seal because it is not currently determinable. In order to complete the critical habitat designation process, we also solicit information on essential physical and biological features of Arctic ringed seal habitat.", 2010-30934,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/12/10/2010-30934/endangered-and-threatened-species-proposed-threatened-status-for-subspecies-of-the-ringed-seal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-12-10/pdf/2010-30934.pdf,12/10/2010
Endangered and Threatened Species; Proposed Threatened and Not Warranted Status for Subspecies and Distinct Population Segments of the Bearded Seal,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review of the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the bearded seal as a threatened or endangered species. The bearded seal exists as two subspecies: Erignathus barbatus nauticus and Erignathus barbatus barbatus. Based on the findings from the status review report and consideration of the factors affecting these subspecies, we conclude that E. b. nauticus consists of two distinct population segments (DPSs), the Beringia DPS and the Okhotsk DPS. Moreover, based on consideration of information presented in the status review report, an assessment of the factors in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, and efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined the Beringia DPS and the Okhotsk DPS are likely to become endangered throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges in the foreseeable future. We have also determined that E. b. barbatus is not in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are now issuing a proposed rule to list the Beringia DPS and the Okhotsk DPS of the bearded seal as threatened species. No listing action is proposed for E. b. barbatus. We solicit comments on this proposed action. At this time, we do not propose to designate critical habitat for the Beringia DPS because it is not currently determinable. In order to complete the critical habitat designation process, we solicit information on the essential physical and biological features of bearded seal habitat for the Beringia DPS.", 2010-30931,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/12/10/2010-30931/endangered-and-threatened-species-proposed-threatened-and-not-warranted-status-for-subspecies-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-12-10/pdf/2010-30931.pdf,12/10/2010

Coral Reef Conservation Program Implementation Guidelines,Notice,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"This document provides NOAA's revised Grant Program Implementation Guidelines (Guidelines) for the Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP or Program) under the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 (Act). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), through the NOAA Administrator (Administrator) and subject to the availability of funds, to provide matching grants of financial assistance for coral reef conservation projects under the Act. NOAA revised the Implementation Guidelines for the Grant Program, which were originally published in 2002, to be applicable to Fiscal Years (FY) 2011 through FY 2015 and published a draft of the revision in the Federal Register notice of January 19, 2010 (75 FR 3114-3120) for review and comment.

Notice of Funding Availability for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Challenge Planning Grants and the Department of Transportation's TIGER II Planning Grants,Notice,Housing and Urban Development Department; Transportation Department,"This notice announces the availability of funding and requests proposals for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (``HUD's'') Community Challenge Planning Grants (``Community Challenge Planning Grants'') in conjunction with a portion of the Department of Transportation's (``DOT's'') National Infrastructure Investments Grants that can be used for transportation planning grants. On December 16, 2009, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-117) that provided $40 million for HUD's Community Challenge Planning Grants and up to $35 million for DOT's transportation planning grants to be awarded as part of the National Infrastructure Investments program. The National Infrastructure Investments program is similar, but not identical to, the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or ``TIGER Discretionary Grant Program.'' Because of the similarity in program structure, DOT is referring to the grants for National Infrastructure Investments under the FY 2010 Appropriations Act as ``TIGER II Discretionary Grants'' and the transportation planning grants as ``TIGER II Planning Grants.'' HUD's $40 million Community Challenge Planning Grant Program will foster reform and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital, and sustainable communities. Such efforts may include amending or replacing local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes, either on a jurisdiction-wide basis or in a specific neighborhood, district, corridor, or sector to promote mixed-use development, affordable housing, the reuse of older buildings and structures for new purposes, and similar activities with the goal of promoting sustainability at the local or neighborhood level. HUD's Community Challenge Planning Grant Program also supports the development of affordable housing through the development and adoption of inclusionary zoning ordinances and other activities such as acquisition of land for affordable housing projects. The Community Challenge Planning Grant Program differs from HUD's Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program, a $100 million program also created in the FY2010 Appropriations Act. While the latter program is designed to support regional planning efforts, the Community Challenge Planning Grant Program focuses on individual jurisdictions and more localized planning. HUD will publish a separate NOFA for the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program. DOT is authorized to use up to $35 million of the funds available for TIGER II Discretionary Grants for TIGER II Planning Grants to fund the planning, preparation, or design of surface transportation projects that would be eligible for funding under the TIGER II Discretionary Grant program. DOT and HUD have decided to issue this NOFA jointly in order to better align transportation, housing, economic development, and land use planning and to improve linkages between DOT and HUD's programs. HUD's funding is designed to target housing, economic development, and land use planning strategies that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a related transportation project being planned. Therefore, DOT and HUD believe this joint effort has the potential to encourage and reward more holistic planning efforts that result in better projects being built with Federal dollars. The effort is also consistent with the Obama Administration's priority on removing artificial barriers between Federal programs and barriers to State and local governmental level innovation. On April 26, 2010 (75 FR 21695), DOT published an interim notice announcing the availability of funding for TIGER II Discretionary Grants. Because the TIGER II Discretionary Grant program is a new program, the interim notice requested comments on the proposed selection criteria and guidance for awarding TIGER II Discretionary Grants. In the interim notice, DOT specifically requested comments on its intention to conduct a multi-agency evaluation and award process with HUD for the Community Challenge Planning Grants and the TIGER II Planning Grants. DOT indicated that this multi-agency approach for the planning grants would be consistent with DOT and HUD's participation in the ``Partnership for Sustainable Communities'' with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') to help American families in all communities--rural, suburban and urban--gain better access to affordable housing, more transportation options, lower transportation costs, and a cleaner environment. HUD and DOT have considered the comments that were submitted in accordance with the interim notice and decided to conduct a multi-agency evaluation and award process. The details of this multi-agency planning grant program, including information about eligibility, selection criteria, and pre-application and application requirements are included in this joint notice. The final notice for the TIGER II Discretionary Grant program (the ``TIGER II Discretionary Grant NOFA'') was published on June 1, 2010 (75 FR 30460). Interested parties are encouraged to review the TIGER II Discretionary Grant NOFA for more information about that program.", 2010-15353,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/06/24/2010-15353/notice-of-funding-availability-for-the-department-of-housing-and-urban-developments-community,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-06-24/pdf/2010-15353.pdf,06/24/2010

"Environmental Impact Statement for the Expanded Moynihan/Penn Station Redevelopment Project, New York, NY",Notice,Transportation Department; Federal Railroad Administration,"FRA is issuing this notice to advise the public that it will jointly prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) with the New York State Urban Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) to assess the proposed Expanded Moynihan/Penn Station Redevelopment Project (the project) in New York City. The project is a comprehensive public/private development initiative to adaptively reuse the historic James A. Farley Building and the Western Annex (collectively referred to as the Farley Complex) as a new train station (Moynihan West) and relocated Madison Square Garden, to reconstruct critical station and circulation elements at the existing Pennsylvania Station (Penn Station) referred to herein as Moynihan East, and to implement transit-oriented private development. FRA is issuing this notice to solicit public and agency input into the development of the scope of the EIS and to advise the public that outreach activities conducted by ESDC and its representatives will be considered in the preparation of the EIS. The EIS will be prepared in accordance the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and the applicable regulations implementing NEPA as set forth in 40 CFR 1500-1508, FRA's Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts found at 64 FR 28545 (May 26, 1999), and the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and its implementing regulations found at 6 New York Code of Rules and Regulations Part 617. The EIS will also address as necessary Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 4(f) of the U.S. Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (49 U.S.C. 303) (DOT Act) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The EIS will evaluate a ``Preferred Alternative,'' a ``No Action Alternative'' and various build alternatives that modify elements of the Preferred Alternative. There are two options under consideration for the Preferred Alternative. Under either of these options, the development of the Project would occur at the Farley Complex (Block 755) owned by ESDC and bounded by Ninth Avenue to the west, Eighth Avenue to the east, West 31st Street to the south and West 33rd Street to the north; the Penn Station Block (Block 781) bounded by Eighth Avenue to the west, Seventh Avenue to the east, West 31st Street to the south and West 33rd Street to the north; the Railroad Service Building (Block 780, Lot 60) located mid-block on West 31st Street across the street from Penn Station; the eastern and western portions of the One Penn Plaza Block (Block 783) bounded by Eighth and Seventh Avenues and West 33rd to West 34th Streets; and the United States Postal Service (USPS) Morgan Facility and Annex located on two full blocks (Blocks 726 and 727) bounded by Tenth Avenue to the west, Ninth Avenue to the east and between West 28th and West 30th Streets ESDC may also acquire properties on one or more blocks immediately adjacent to the Penn Station Block to facilitate the construction of a loading dock and other support facilities for Moynihan Station, and to otherwise further the goals of the project. In addition, under one of the two options being considered, the City of New York would establish a new zoning subdistrict (the Subdistrict Option). This Subdistrict Option would allow development rights from the Penn Station Block to be transferred under certain specified conditions to receiving sites located within the subdistrict and at prescribed maximum floor areas. It is anticipated that the boundaries of the proposed subdistrict would include approximately 20 city blocks surrounding the Penn Station Block, extending as far south as West 28th Street, as far north as West 36th Street, as far east as within 200 feet west of Fifth Avenue, and as far west as 200 feet west of Ninth Avenue. In a related zoning action to be examined in the EIS, the City, in connection with the Subdistrict Option only, has proposed to change the underlying zoning classifications for a number of lots or blocks within the proposed subdistrict from manufacturing and commercial uses (M1-5, M1-6, C6-3X, C6-4X and C6-4M) to C6-4. This zoning change, if adopted by the City, would allow residential uses in certain areas where such uses are not currently permitted by zoning.", E7-22069,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2007/11/09/E7-22069/environmental-impact-statement-for-the-expanded-moynihanpenn-station-redevelopment-project-new-york,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2007-11-09/pdf/E7-22069.pdf,11/09/2007

West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan,Uncategorized Document,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS establishes a program, the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan (NEAP), that will provide $12 million of assistance to salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest who have been affected by a fishery resource disaster during 1992 through 1994, while providing conservation benefits to salmon resources. These disaster relief funds, which were made available under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), will be applied toward the following three programs, administered by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program--Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and a habitat restoration jobs program--Soil Conservation Services (SCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); and a data collection jobs program-- Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC).
