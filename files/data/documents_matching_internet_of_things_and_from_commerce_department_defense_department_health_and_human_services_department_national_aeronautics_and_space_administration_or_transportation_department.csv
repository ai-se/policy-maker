"Smart Cities Infrastructure Business Development Mission to India; February 8-12, 2016",Notice,Commerce Department; International Trade Administration,"The United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA) is organizing an Executive-led Smart Cities Infrastructure Business Development Mission to India (New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, with an optional spin off site visit to Vizag) from February 8-12, 2016. Today, India's cities account for approximately 60% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By 2030, that share is expected to reach 75% and the urban labor force is expected to increase by nearly 200 million workers. The new Indian Government led by Prime Minister Modi assumed office in June 2014 with an overwhelming mandate to focus on economic development. To capture the popular imagination and motivate the people of India, the new government has proposed a dramatic nationwide program to build 100 smart cities. In practice this will mean a wide variety of major infrastructure projects across the country that will be funded by the central and state governments over the next few years along with private sector capital. Infrastructure needs in India are estimated to be in the $1.5-$2 trillion range. The recently launched initiative will move to define and implement reforms that drive the growth of smart cities. At this stage, the government has highlighted resource management, 24 hour water and power supply, world class transportation systems, state of the art education systems, advanced e-government, and environmental sustainability as pillars of India's smart cities. This initiative offers excellent opportunities for U.S. companies to participate in these projects in selected areas and sectors. In recognition of cutting-edge U.S. technologies, products and services, the Government of India is encouraging the U.S. Government (USG) and U.S. companies to take the lead in developing smart city projects in three major urban areas: Ajmer in the state of Rajasthan, Allahabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Vishakhapatnam (aka Vizag) in the state of Andhra Pradesh. With the support of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, U.S. companies will be involved in planning and technical assistance for each of these cities. However, U.S. participation is not limited to these three cities. CS India, in partnership with the American Chamber of Commerce and other local commercial chambers, has been staging events throughout the country in cities with additional public and private smart city projects.", 2015-19123,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/08/04/2015-19123/smart-cities-infrastructure-business-development-mission-to-india-february-8-12-2016,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-08-04/pdf/2015-19123.pdf,08/04/2015
