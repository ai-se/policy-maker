<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div>
<p>The impact of technology is accelerating, making the perceived size of the world smaller and smaller.&nbsp; Industries can draw upon human talent anywhere in the world to support their enterprises.&nbsp; As the physical importation into the United States of scientific talent from abroad becomes increasingly competitive, the importance of developing home-grown talent increases.&nbsp; These pressures are predicted to have a profound effect on the American economy and the scientific leadership position of the United States in the world.&nbsp; Concern about continued American competitiveness has led the Federal government to take measures to address the underlying issues.&nbsp; These steps include the President's American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) and Congress' passage of the America COMPETES Act. </p>
<p>The Chemistry Division has co-organized a number of workshops that deal with these same issues, including one focused on American competitiveness in the chemical sciences and related industries.&nbsp; Entitled "Sustaining America's Competitive Edge: Enhancing Innovation and Competitiveness through Investments in Fundamental Research," the workshop report is available at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://enhancinginnovation.wustl.edu/">http://enhancinginnovation.wustl.edu/</a>.&nbsp; Other Chemistry Division workshops have highlighted the need to improve the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the chemical sciences, with an emphasis on academia: "Building Strong Academic Chemistry Departments Through Gender Equity" and &#147;Excellence Empowered by a Diverse Workforce: Achieving Racial and Ethnic Equity in Chemistry.&#148;&nbsp; The report for the former is available at:<br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.chem.harvard.edu/groups/friend/GenderEquityWorkshop/">http://www.chem.harvard.edu/groups/friend/GenderEquityWorkshop/</a>.</p>
<p>Some excerpts from these reports are illustrative of the pressures described above.</p>
<p>"Because of its central position bridging physics, materials, and life sciences, chemistry plays a crucial role in a broad range of technologies...&nbsp; As emerging nations' technologists climb the learning curve, our global economic position is becoming ever more competitive.&nbsp; Yet, in times of increasing needs for scientists and engineers, the workforce pipelines within the United States are woefully inadequate.&nbsp; According to the National Science Board Companion to Science and Engineering Indicators in 2006, there is a troubling decline in the number of U. S. citizens who are training to become scientists and engineers, whereas the number of jobs requiring science and engineering training continues to grow." <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://enhancinginnovation.wustl.edu/"> http://enhancinginnovation.wustl.edu/</a></p>
<p>"Vigorous and imaginative efforts are needed to attract more U. S. citizens to science, engineering, and mathematics. Women and members of minority groups are underutilized human resources of great importance. The talented people drawn to science and technology must be team players, innovators, problem-solvers, doers, and comfortable bridging different areas of research&#133; Academicians and industry leaders should carefully review the graduate education enterprise and consider innovations in the education experience to optimize the prospects for success in today&#146;s highly competitive world of science- and technology-based industry&#133;&nbsp; Policymakers should support a cooperative system of training for academic and industrial researchers across the physical and chemical sciences, allowing researchers from industry to spend time working in a university setting, and vice versa."<br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.chem.harvard.edu/groups/friend/GenderEquityWorkshop/">http://www.chem.harvard.edu/groups/friend/GenderEquityWorkshop/</a></p>
<p>With this community input in mind, the goal of the American Competitiveness in Chemistry-Fellowship program is to support the training of beginning, independent chemical scientists who are proficient at research that straddles the academic-industrial-national laboratory interfaces and at developing untapped pools of scientific talent that exist in this country.</p></div>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a></h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p><div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
</blockquote>
</div><div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p><p>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p></div><p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p><div>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Partnership: How will the collaboration with the partner enrich the research of the applicant?&nbsp; Are there additional methods/techniques/infrastructure/materials available to the applicant through the collaboration that would not otherwise be available?&nbsp; Will the collaboration contribute positively to the postgraduate educational experience of the applicant?&nbsp; Will the collaboration help build lasting ties between the applicant's institution and the partner?</li>
    <li>Broadening Participation Plan:&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the plan reasonable for the time commitment that the applicant proposes?&nbsp; Is the plan expected to have lasting, meaningful results?&nbsp; Will the activities be self-sustaining?&nbsp; How will the applicant determine the success of her/his broadening participation plan?&nbsp;</li>
</ul></p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p></p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter.

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong><span>
                                        &nbsp;American Competitiveness in Chemistry-Fellowship applicants will be notified if they will be offered a Fellowship.&nbsp; The applicant must accept the Fellowship (via email to the cognizant program officer) or withdraw their application within 30 days of notification.&nbsp; Fellowships must begin in September 2008.
<p>Unaffiliated applicants must affiliate with a host organization in order to receive the Fellowship.&nbsp; A Fellows Award will not be finalized until a host organization provides to NSF a revised cover sheet and budget for the proposed activity signed by an authorized organizational representative.&nbsp; Guidance regarding this process will be provided by the NSF Program Officer.</p>
<p>Fellowships are made to the organization on behalf of the Fellow.&nbsp; If the Fellow chooses to affiliate with another organization during the Fellowship and receives approval from the NSF Program Officer, the current awardee organization must allow the fellowship to be transferred.</p></span><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.
