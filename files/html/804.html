          <p class="MsoNormal">The CBC Program is designed to support the formation
            of centers that can address major, long-term basic chemical research
            problems.&#160; Appropriate research problems are high-risk but potentially
            high-impact because they will attract broad scientific and public
            interest.&#160; Centers are expected to be agile structures that
            can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities and make full use of
            cyber infrastructure to enhance collaborations.&#160; Center teams
            may include researchers from other disciplines and from academia,
            industry, government laboratories and international organizations.&#160; Centers
            will be selected through a multi-phase peer-review process.&#160; Phase
            I consists of a preliminary proposal that will be peer reviewed,
            followed by an invited&#160;full proposal to explore development
            of a center.&#160; Success at both&#160;steps of Phase I is an eligibility
            criterion for participation in Phase II. Phase II consists of proposals
            seeking full-scale implementation of a CBC in FY 2007.</p>

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>The Division of Chemistry&#160;is initiating a new program, called
          Chemical Bonding Centers (CBCs), to nurture&#160;innovative approaches
          to addressing major intellectual challenges in basic chemical research
          and education with the potential for broad societal impact. As the
          name implies, CBCs will leverage a deeper understanding of the most
          fundamental of chemical concepts &#8211; the chemical bond &#8211; through
          research partnerships that benefit the scientific enterprise and society.&#160;&#160;CBCs
          will provide the opportunity for especially able and ambitious groups
          of investigators to share a commitment toward solving a "big problem" in
          an atmosphere having a high tolerance for risk and within a structure
          permitting considerable agility.&#160; A recent workshop at NSF explored
          mechanisms for encouraging and supporting such initiatives.&#160; A
          report of the workshop can be obtained at <a href="http://www.mrl.uiuc.edu/docs/nsfgmwfinal.pdf">http://www.mrl.uiuc.edu/docs/nsfgmwfinal.pdf</a></p>
        <p>The Division of Chemistry expects to make awards in Fiscal Year (FY)
          2004 to support activities in the Chemical Bonding Centers (CBC) Program.&#160;&#160;The
          CBC Program competition comprises three peer-reviewed&#160;steps and
          requires success in all three steps.&#160; The first&#160;two steps
          will occur in Phase I in the initial year of competition.&#160; The
          first step&#160;consists of a Preliminary Proposal&#160;that describes
          a center concept, a schematic model for the research to be carried
          out, and a group of initiating participants (PI and&#160;other senior
          personnel who&#160;may or may not be&#160;co-PIs but have agreed to
          participate on the project); there is no funding associated with this
          step.&#160; Those proposals judged meritorious by peer review&#160;will
          be invited&#160;to compete for funding in the second step, which requires
          submission&#160;of a&#160;Full Proposal to explore development of a
          center.&#160;&#160;Full Proposals outline center goals, a developmental
          plan for forming and&#160;mobilizing the center&#8217;s team, and benchmarks
          for producing key proofs of concept within an award duration of three
          years at a level of about $500,000 per year.&#160;&#160;These development
          teams will be&#160;eligible to participate in the third step&#160;of
          the competition, by submitting a&#160;proposal for the establishment
          of a CBC in Phase II.&#160; It is anticipated that, assuming availability
          of funds and appropriate quality of proposals, there will be two CBC
          awards in Phase II.&#160; Each Phase II award is expected to have a
          duration of five years, at a level averaging $3M per year,&#160;with
          possible renewal for a second five-year period at the same average
          level of $3M per year.&#160; The specific program&#160;solicitation
          for the CBC proposals in Phase II will be available approximately&#160;October
          2006 (for funding in FY 2007).&#160; The CBC competition for Phase
          I is anticipated to take place quadrennially, with the next solicitation
          for Phase I Preliminary Proposals to occur approximately September
          2007.&#160;</p>

      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>The CBC Program is designed to support the formation of centers that
          can address major, long-term basic chemical research problems.&#160; Appropriate
          research problems are high-risk but potentially high-impact because
          they will attract broad scientific and public interest.&#160; Centers
          are expected to be agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging
          opportunities and make full use of cyber infrastructure to enhance
          collaborations.&#160; Center teams may include researchers from other
          disciplines and from academia, industry, government laboratories and
          international organizations.&#160; Centers will be selected through
          a process comprising three peer-reviewed&#160;steps spanning three
          years and requiring success in all three steps.&#160; Team sizes will
          reflect the needs of the problem to be studied, but a minimum of three
          investigators is required.&#160;</p>
        <p>All participants must follow the three-step process that involves
          in Phase I the submission of a Preliminary Proposal that will be peer
          reviewed,&#160;followed by an invited Full Proposal that provides resources
          for preliminary organization of the center and implementation of proof-of-concept
          activities. The third step, Phase II, is submission of a CBC proposal
          in FY 2007 for establishment of a full-scale CBC. All&#160;steps of
          the competition will involve comprehensive peer review and require
          success at each&#160;prior step of the process to be eligible to compete
          in the next step.</p>
        <p>Although&#160;basic chemical research and education is the focus of
          the Program, it is anticipated that successful centers will involve
          unconventional multidisciplinary research centered in the chemical
          sciences and aimed at solving high-risk, long-term problems of large
          scope and impact.&#160; Because it is often not possible to provide
          compelling preliminary results in such circumstances,&#160;a major
          goal of the CBC Program is to afford a framework that still allows&#160;rigorous
          and constructive use of peer review to select appropriate CBC projects. &#160; It
          is anticipated that this framework will foster the establishment of
          new areas of research and new communities of scientists and engineers.&#160; These
          communities&#160;will bring common and complementary interests into
          productive contact to develop a culture of risk-taking and innovation
          around structures that are agile and take full advantage of cyber infrastructure
          for fostering collaborations. Further, the awards made under the CBC
          Program will be expected to put in place innovative plans to make chemistry
          and chemists more visible&#160;to the broader scientific community
          and to the public.</p>
        <p>Examples of possible CBC outcomes are:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li class="MsoNormal">The emergence of new areas of chemical inquiry;</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">The solution of problems in basic chemical research
            beyond the scope of individual&#160; investigators and/or single
            disciplines that have broad scientific impact;</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">The development of a model for innovative, high-risk,
            cyber-enabled science;&#160;</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">An enhanced favorable perception of chemistry
            and chemists by the broader scientific community and by the public.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prior to submission of a Preliminary Proposal, investigators are strongly
          urged to discuss ideas with a cognizant Program Officer listed at the
          end of this document. &#160;In both Preliminary and&#160;Full Proposals,&#160;investigators
          contemplating the involvement of industrial, government&#160;&#160;and/or
          international team members&#160;will need to provide an institutional
          letter of collaboration from the partner organization that confirms
          the participation of a co-investigator. This letter should be included
          in the Supplementary Documents Section&#160;of the&#160;Preliminary
          and Full Proposals. (See Section V, below). The letter should describe
          the plan of interaction with the U.S. academic institution, the time
          commitment of the researcher(s), and the nature of the collaborative
          research activities. Letters of general support or recommendation are
          inappropriate and may cause a proposal to be returned without review.&#160; Cost
          sharing is not required for Phase I proposals.&#160; Any commitments
          detailed in this section will not be auditable.</p>
        <p>For Full&#160;Proposals, support for collaborations with international
          scientists is provided through the NSF grant to the submitting U.S.&#160;institution. &#160; No&#160;Full
          Proposal award funds may go directly to foreign institutions. The proposal
          may include up to $100,000 in participant support&#160;costs, over
          the duration of the grant, for international collaborative research
          activities. Travel and incidental research costs may be included; salaries
          may not. These international interactions must feature a joint scientific
          work plan and should be clearly described in the Project Description.
          If, after review, a proposal is recommended for funding, the cognizant
          Program Officer will work with Program Officers from the NSF Office
          of International Science and Engineering and the key project personnel
          to develop a detailed plan consistent with applicable international
          arrangements.</p>
        <p>Co-investigators associated with entities such as industry, state
          agencies and national laboratories (Federally Funded Research and Development
          Centers (FFRDCs)) must be supported by their own organization. However,
          it is appropriate for students supported through universities to work
          at a partner industrial laboratory, FFRDC or comparable site, or for
          universities to fund research expenses incurred when scientists from
          such entities work at university sites. Federal employees may not receive
          salaries or in other ways augment their agency's appropriation through
          grants made by this program, and no funds for major equipment at FFRDC's
          are allowed.</p>
        <p>Principal Investigators should ensure that their proposed project
          does not overlap with ongoing Federally funded research.&#160; Proposals
          in topical areas covered by FY 2004 competitions in Information Technology
          Research (ITR), Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE), Biocomplexity
          in the Environment (BE), Environmental Molecular Science Institutes
          (EMSIs)&#160;or Collaborative Research in Chemistry (CRC) will not
          be considered in the CBC Program. Additional information is available
          through the the NSF Guide to Programs ( <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/pub.cfm?gp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/pub.cfm?gp</a> ).&#160;&#160; NSF
          reserves the right to return without review proposals that are not
          appropriate for the CBC Program.</p>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

        <A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></A> <B>Additional Review Criteria</B>:
        <p>In addition to the National Science Board merit review criteria, reviewers
          will be asked to apply the following criteria when reviewing CBC proposals:</p>
        <p>Preliminary Proposals (Phase I, Step One)</p>
        <ul class="noindent">
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal describe&#160;research focused
            on a "big problem"&#160;in basic chemical research that involves
            innovation, high risk, and requires a long timeline?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal present evidence that chemistry
            will be&#160;the driver in&#160;addressing&#160;the problem?&#160;</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal make a compelling case that
            the project will engage the broader scientific community and the
            public?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal have the potential for building
            a research team with the appropriate agility, skills, and tools,
            including cyber infrastructure, to attack the problem successfully?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal&#160;suggest a reasonable scientific
            goal for&#160;a&#160;Phase I Full&#160;Proposal&#160;and a cogent
            preliminary plan to begin work on it (Step Two of the competition)?</li>

          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the project have the potential for a major
            advance in chemistry or at the interface&#160;of chemistry and other&#160;sciences?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Are the scientific goals of&#160;Step Two&#160;appropriate
            for the&#160;development of&#160;a CBC?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Is the schematic model for the work to be carried
            out in Step Two sound?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Is there capacity&#160;for agility and creativity
            in the context of an evolving center?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the project have the potential to attract
            broad scientific and public interest and support?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Are there plans&#160;to&#160;develop the groundwork
            for an effective educational, dissemination, and management plan
            in&#160;Phase II (Step Three) and effective use of cyber infrastructure?</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Does the proposal have the potential to lead

      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc and/or
        panel review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
        special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
        thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
        expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
        any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
        the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
        conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal
        Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement
        or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements. </p>
      <p> *These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
