<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>
<p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding opportunity. Proposers who opt to submit prior to January 18, 2011, must also follow the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG has been revised to implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing.&nbsp; Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal.&nbsp; The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information.&nbsp; Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director.&nbsp; See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) </em>Chapter II.C.2.g(xi) for further information about the implementation of these&nbsp;recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG contains a clarification of NSF's long standing data policy.&nbsp; All proposals must describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans.&nbsp; FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan.&nbsp; The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as appropriate.&nbsp;Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>. See <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter II.C.2.j</a> of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.&nbsp; Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter II.C.2.j</a> of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the <em>Cyberlearning: Transforming Education</em> program, NSF seeks to integrate advances in technology with advances in what is known about how people learn to </p>
<ul>
<li>better understand how people learn with technology and how technology can be used productively to help people learn, through individual use and/or through collaborations mediated by technology;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>better use technology for collecting, analyzing, sharing, and managing data to shed light on learning, promoting learning, and designing learning environments; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>design new technologies for these purposes, and advance understanding of how to use those technologies and integrate them into learning environments so that their potential is fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest are technological advances that allow more personalized learning experiences, draw in and promote learning among those in populations not currently served well by current educational practices, allow access to learning resources anytime and anywhere, and provide new ways of assessing capabilities. It is expected that Cyberlearning research will shed light on how technology can enable new forms of educational practice and that broad implementation of its findings will result in a more actively-engaged and productive citizenry and workforce.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Amplifying, expanding, and transforming opportunities people have for learning, and better drawing in, motivating, and engaging young learners are among society's central challenges. Engaging actively as a citizen and productively in the workforce requires understanding a vast variety of concepts and the ability to collaborate, learn, solve problems, and make decisions. Whether learning is facilitated in school or out of school, and whether learners are youngsters or adults, to develop such knowledge and capabilities, learners must be motivated to learn, actively engage over the long term in learning activities, and put forth sustained cognitive and social effort.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Research supported by the <em>Cyberlearning</em> program will explore the opportunities for learning made possible by new technologies, how to help learners capitalize on those opportunities, new practices that are made possible by learning technologies, and ways of using technology to promote deep and lasting learning of content, practices, skills, attitudes, and/or dispositions needed for engaged and productive citizenship. Cyberlearning research will marry what is known about how people learn with advances in information and communications technologies to advance understanding of how to cultivate a citizenry that engages productively in learning both in and out of school and throughout a lifetime; and that possesses the knowledge, knowledge building, collaboration and reasoning capabilities to make informed decisions and judgments about problems ranging from their immediate lives to ethics, privacy, and security concerns to global challenges such as war and peace, economics, health and wellbeing, and the environment.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>The goals of the Cyberlearning program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To better understand how people learn with technology and how technology can be used productively to help people learn, through individual use and/or through collaborations mediated by technology;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To better use technology for collecting, analyzing, sharing, and managing data to shed light on learning, promoting learning, and designing learning environments; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To design new technologies for these purposes, and advance understanding of how to use those technologies and integrate them into learning environments so that their potential is fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program will fund projects that explore opportunities for learning made possible by new technologies, how to help learners capitalize on those opportunities, new practices that are made possible by learning technologies, and ways of using technology to promote deep and lasting learning of content, practices, skills, attitudes, and/or dispositions needed for engaged and productive citizenship.&nbsp;Every project should therefore seek to answer questions about how to better promote learning, how to promote better learning, or how learning happens in technology-rich environments (including exploring relationships between people and technology that result in productive learning and access provided with technology to learning resources, such as data and scientific information). Each project should also focus, concurrently, on innovative technology design, ways of coherently integrating technologies for learning, and/or the integration of such technology into targeted learning environments. Especially sought are projects in which technology allows the tailoring of learning experiences to special needs and interests of groups or individuals, as well as ways in which technology allows expanding education beyond classroom settings. Proposed research and innovations should be grounded in theories of and the literatures on learning and education.</p>
<p>Proposed cyberlearning technological innovations cannot be explored - much less effect transformations on learning - without being substantively integrated into authentic learning environments, taking into account the affordances (opportunities offered) and constraints of the environment, including the capabilities, needs, and goals of agents in the environment, the resources that are available, and the physical space. &nbsp;Concomitantly, integration of technologies into learning environments may change those environments, prompting a need to understand, predict, and design for those changes. Indeed, it is expected that some technology designs and some ways of integrating technology into learning environments may challenge conventional educational practices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Research should be situated in one or more of the real-world contexts in which people can learn (including formal or informal environments, traditional and non-traditional environments for learning, and individual and collaborative learning settings). Projects should take into account both theoretical and practical issues, focusing on new directions while, at the same time, taking into account a future in which research outcomes inform implementations on broader and larger scales.&nbsp; It is expected that all projects will advance understanding about how people learn with technology, how to use technology to help people learn, and/or how to use technology to enhance assessment or education practices. A significant amount of effort in all projects will also go into design and implementation of technological innovations that will be iteratively refined over the course of the project based on systematic analysis of formative data. </p>
<p>Projects should make clear the learning domain to be explored (e.g., content, subject matter, topics, skills, practices) and make a research-based case for the promise of the particular technological innovation for promoting learning in this domain. Data should be collected and analyzed to produce evidence of learning outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>PROJECT TEAMS</strong></p>
<p>Projects funded through Cyberlearning will typically&nbsp;be interdisciplinary, with the research team including members with the full range of expertise needed for success, in areas such as human learning, engagement, technology design, technology integration, education, and human-centered computing, as well as expertise in the nature of the targeted learning environment, the technologies being investigated, and carrying out data collection and analysis. The integrated contributions of the members of each proposal team should clearly be greater than the sum of the contributions of each individual member of the team.&nbsp; Since successful collaborative research depends on thoughtful coordination mechanisms, a Collaboration Plan is <strong>required </strong>for all proposals involving multiple investigators. The length of and level of detail provided in the Collaboration Plan should be commensurate with the complexity of the collaboration. Please see <em>Proposal Preparation Instructions </em>Section V.A for additional submission guidelines.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;project team should be appropriate for addressing proposed implementation and research goals. Each team is expected to carry out the data collection and analysis necessary to evaluate and refine their innovation and answer their research questions. Teams should be formed accordingly. It is important that proposers establish teams that will help them address issues they anticipate as being important for success. Proposals should make clear the roles of all team members (PIs, supporting investigators, advisors, and others), why the proposed team is an appropriate one, and what expertise each team member brings. Teams should include members who have experience with the learners and environments being targeted and who are expert at relevant engagement and learning issues. Proposers should make clear the challenges associated with assessment and evaluation, robustness and broader usability that they anticipate, and the team members that will help with each of these.</p>
<p>Project proposers should also include on their teams people who can help them plan towards fulfilling the transformational potential of their work,&nbsp;including, as appropriate, those who can&nbsp;help them transition their technology to&nbsp;broad use and those from stakeholder groups who will need to be integrated into the project as innovations move towards scalability, broad dissemination, and continuation over time.&nbsp; As appropriate to the proposed work, project teams should include members who will help in building bridges between communities, helping to make sure the proposed work is appropriate for targeted stakeholders, helping stakeholders and researchers participate in design together, and helping stakeholders understand and come to enthusiastically embrace proposed innovations. It will be appropriate for some projects to include representatives of private-sector or non-profit companies who might&nbsp;be involved&nbsp;with technology transfer.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT CLASSES</strong></p>
<p>Cyberlearning awards will be made in three categories:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Exploration Projects (EXP projects)</em> explore the proof-of-concept or feasibility of a novel or innovative technology or use of such technology to promote learning. &nbsp;EXP projects might explore how existing technologies can be used to promote learning or explore the affordances of a new or existing technology for learning purposes (the opportunities for engaging in learning that it makes possible).<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em>Project characteristics:</em> EXP projects should take into account what we know about how people learn and the affordances (opportunities offered) of the technology being investigated.</li>
<li><em>Formative analyses</em>: At a minimum, formative analyses should focus on the usability of the technology and effective ways of using the technology to learn and should explore pathways towards engaging learners in the technology's sustained use. </li>
<li><em>Project team:</em> Project teams should include, at a minimum, partners with expertise in how people learn, the targeted domain, the technology/ies being investigated, how to engage and sustain the engagement of learners, and how to collect and analyze data that can inform about usability and effectiveness. Such expertise may reside in a single PI and his/her advisory committee or may be distributed across co-PIs and&nbsp;an advisory committee.</li>
<li><em>Duration and funding</em>: EXP awards will be funded over a 2 or 3 year period for up to $550,000 total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Design and Implementation Projects (DIP projects)</em> will conduct research in the everyday environments in which people spend their lives, e.g., schools, homes, museums, parks, and the workplace. These projects might advance understanding about how to more broadly or productively use technology that holds promise or how to coherently integrate several technological innovations that hold promise.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em>Project characteristics: </em>Innovations should take into account not only what is known about how people learn but also how to sustain engagement over long periods of time, and proposers should make clear how their innovation addresses the needs and capabilities of targeted learners (or users). Innovations should also be designed taking into account real-world affordances (opportunities offered) and constraints of the targeted learning environment, including the people and resources that might be available. By later years of the project, leadership roles should be carried out by those who would naturally carry them out in the chosen learning environment. </li>
<li><em>Formative analyses</em>: DIP project formative analyses should focus, at a minimum, on the usability of the technology, its effects on learning and/or engagement, and effective ways of integrating use of the technology into activities in the learning environment, including good practices for promoting learning and means of engaging learners in the technology's sustained and effective use.&nbsp; Data collection and analysis should answer questions about the design and efficacy of the proposed innovation as well as questions about learning with technology and the practicality and sustainability of using the technology within the targeted environment.</li>
<li><em>Project team</em>: The project team should include the types of partners required for EXP projects and also partners with expertise in the capabilities of the targeted learners, the targeted learning domain, and the constraints and affordances (opportunities offered) of the targeted learning environment. As appropriate, the team should include representatives of stakeholder groups, to help the team plan towards broader use and deployment and/or organizations that&nbsp;will help with technology transfer. The team should also include teachers and/or mentors who would normally take on leadership responsibilities in targeted environments. </li>
<li><em>Duration and funding: </em>DIP projects will be funded over a 4 or 5-year period up to a total of $1,350,000 total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Integration and Deployment Projects (INDP Projects)</em> should also be carried out in the everyday environments in which people spend their lives, and like other types of projects, they will answer questions about learning and about design of technology. These projects will build on research that has already shown the promise of some technology or set of technologies for promoting learning or advancing our understanding of learning. These projects might advance understanding of how to more broadly or productively use technology that holds promise or how to coherently integrate several technological innovations that hold promise.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em>Project characteristics: </em>Proposed innovations should take into account the broad range of issues important to successful learning <em>and deployment</em>, including what is known about how people learn, how to engage and sustain engagement among learners, characteristics of the learner population and the targeted learning environments, and the preparation of those who will introduce and take on leadership responsibilities in promoting learning with the technology (e.g., teachers and mentors). These projects may be of several different types:<br>
<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>They may advance understanding of how to productively integrate a variety of established technologies to better promote learning or promote better learning in a target population and environment.</li>
<li>They may provide guidelines on extending the usage of some promising technology or technologies over a larger variety of learner populations, advancing understanding of how to better address learning needs of different populations.</li>
<li>They may provide guidelines on extending the usage of some promising technology or technologies over a larger variety of learning contexts, advancing understanding of learning processes that underlie disciplinary areas or the constraints and affordances (opportunities offered) of different environments for learning.</li>
<li>They may combine advances in two or more of these areas.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is expected that technologies will be deployed and evaluated in a large variety of learning environments, that by the end of the project, the technology will be ready for technology transfer and commercialization, and that the guidelines proposed will be broadly applicable beyond the particular technology being deployed. By later years of the project, facilitation of technology use should be done by those who would naturally be the facilitators in the chosen learning environment (e.g., teachers, scout leaders, parents, peers).</li>
<li><em>Formative analyses</em>: As for DIP projects, formative analyses should answer questions about usability, learning, effective and sustained use, as well as issues associated with scale-up, sustainability, workforce development, and long-term efficacy (as appropriate).</li>
<li><em>Project team</em>: Of necessity, these projects will require broad partnerships, including the types of collaborators listed above and also collaborators who can advise about scale-up and sustainability issues. The team should also include collaborators who can provide guidance in helping facilitators learn to integrate the technology into learning activities.&nbsp; Planning toward scale up will require, for many projects, partnerships with school systems and other potential stakeholder groups. The project team should include the full range of partners needed to consider issues in all relevant areas. These teams should include representatives of stakeholder groups, and it is expected that PIs will negotiate formal collaboration relationships with school districts, museums, or other organizations that would potentially deploy the technology. It will&nbsp;usually be appropriate for these teams include representatives of organizations that will&nbsp;aid technology transfer.</li>
<li><em>Duration and funding</em>: INDP awards will be for up to 5 years and up to $2,500,000 total. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cyberlearning program will fund a portfolio of projects representing exciting, potentially transformative research with potential for high impact and significant advancement of the state of the art. Proposals should demonstrate that their innovation will offer rich learning experiences for a diverse population of learners. It will be appropriate for many proposals to include the development of innovative curricula or educational materials in addition to proposing technological innovations. Interdisciplinary (including collaborators from the arts and humanities), international, and/or academic-industry collaborations that promise to result in major science or engineering advances are welcome. The program seeks proposals from investigators at a broad range of learning institutions, including faculty at minority-serving and predominantly undergraduate institutions.</p>
<p>A successful research project should be potentially transformative; grounded in existing learning and education research; seek to answer questions about learning with technology; measure learning gains, take into account appropriate elements of the learning ecology in designing its innovation, evaluating its innovation, and answering research questions; include team members with all necessary expertise, including expertise for outreach and dissemination; be aware of potential scalability and sustainability issues; and use appropriate methodologies to evaluate innovations and measure learning gains. Our expectation is that many grants made by this program will seed long-term research enterprises. The transformative potential of proposed projects may be many years out, so proposers should make clear what that potential is and the predicted time horizon.</p>
<p><strong>CYBERLEARNING RESOURCE NETWORK</strong></p>
<p>The Cyberlearning program anticipates creating a future resource network that will provide assessment, technology transfer, dissemination, and evaluation aid to PIs. This resource network will help Cyberlearning PIs collaborate to synthesize findings across the Cyberlearning portfolio, will provide technical assistance to Cyberlearning projects, will help promote national awareness of research contributions from the Cyberlearning portfolio, and will help build the Cyberlearning community through PI and special interest meetings. All Cyberlearning projects will be required to share their proposals and findings with the resource network and other Cyberlearning PIs, to participate in annual PI meetings and synthesis, and to be responsive to requests for information from other Cyberlearning PIs and from the resource network. </p>

<p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
<p>Collaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. Chapter II, Section D.4 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p>
<p>The following information SUPPLEMENTS (not replaces) the guidelines provided in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) and the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal Titles:</strong> Proposal titles must begin with an acronym that indicates the categories in which proposals are being submitted, as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploration Projects - EXP</li>
<li>Design and Implementation Projects - DIP</li>
<li>Integration and Deployment Projects - INDP</li>
</ul>
<p>The acronym should be followed with a colon then the title of the proposed project. If you submit a proposal as one in a set of collaborative proposals, the title of your proposal should begin with the acronym that indicates the project category, followed by a colon, then &quot;Collaborative Research&quot; followed by a colon, and then the project title. For example, if you are submitting an Exploration Project, the title of each collaborative proposal would be <strong>EXP:Collaborative Research: Project Title.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong>&nbsp; The Project Summary must include an explicit description of both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of the activities proposed, preferably in separate paragraphs&nbsp;titled &quot;Intellectual Merit&quot; and &quot;Broader Impacts&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
</h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
</p>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>For Design and Implementation Projects (DIP) and Implementation and Deployment Projects (IMDP) only, reviewers will be asked to comment on the extent to which the project scope       justifies the level of investment requested, and the degree to which the       Collaboration Plan (if required) adequately demonstrates that the       participating investigators will work synergistically to accomplish the       project objectives.<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a></p>
</ul>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review. </p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
</p>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report&nbsp;will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
