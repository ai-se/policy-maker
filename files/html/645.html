<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>
<p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a> apply to INVITED FULL proposals submitted in response to this funding opportunity. Proposers who opt to submit prior to January 18, 2011, must also follow the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG has been revised to implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing.&nbsp; Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal.&nbsp; The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information.&nbsp; Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director.&nbsp; See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) </em>Chapter II.C.2.g(xi) for further information about the implementation of these&nbsp;recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG contains a clarification of NSF's long standing data policy.&nbsp; All proposals must describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans.&nbsp; FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan.&nbsp; The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as appropriate.&nbsp;Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>. See Chapter II.C.2.j of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.&nbsp; Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan. See Chapter II.C.2.j of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Notes:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Solicitation represents a new initiative within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program (STEP).&nbsp; The existing STEP Solicitation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08569">NSF 08-569</a> also remains in effect, with a proposal deadline of September 28, 2010, for Type 1A, Type 1B, and Type 1C proposals that are directed at increasing the number of students receiving associate or baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields, and for Type 2 proposals that support educational research projects on associate or baccalaureate degree attainment in STEM.&nbsp; Further, it is expected that the competition described in STEP Solicitation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08569">NSF 08-569</a> will continue into the future.</p>
<p>Applications to the STEP Centers competition are independent of applications under STEP Solicitation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08569">NSF 08-569</a>.&nbsp; Applications to the STEP Centers competition do not affect the number of proposals that may be submitted by institutions to the competition under STEP Solicitation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08569">NSF 08-569</a>, nor do applications submitted to STEP Solicitation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08569">NSF 08-569</a> affect the number of proposals that may be submitted by an institution to the STEP Centers competition.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Undergraduate education is central to the National Science Foundation's mission in human resource development. Whether preparing students to participate as citizens in a technological society, to enter the workforce with two- or four-year degrees, to continue their formal education in graduate school, or to further their education in response to new career goals or workplace expectations, undergraduate education provides the critical link between the Nation's secondary schools and a society increasingly dependent upon science and technology.  To support the growth and effectiveness of undergraduate education, the America COMPETES Act, H.R.2272, has called for major efforts to increase the number of students completing undergraduate courses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including the number of nonmajors, and to improve student academic achievement in those courses.  This STEP Centers initiative provides an opportunity for the academic community and other stakeholders to work toward these goals.<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
</p>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p><strong>All STEP Centers</strong></p>
<p>The STEP Centers competition allows a group of faculty representing a cross section of institutions of higher education to identify a national challenge or opportunity in undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to propose a comprehensive and coordinated set of activities that will be carried out to address that challenge or opportunity within a national context.&nbsp; Each STEP Center will be awarded jointly by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) and one of the following: the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), or the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Program activities for all STEP Centers should be designed to have a national impact on increasing the number of students, including STEM majors or non-STEM majors or both, enrolling in undergraduate courses in STEM, and to improve student learning and retention in those courses, by developing, evaluating, and disseminating one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational materials for undergraduate courses, laboratories, curricula, or other aspects of the undergraduate experience;</li>
<li>Teaching methods for undergraduate courses; and/or</li>
<li>Professional development to improve the capacity of faculty and teaching assistants to provide effective instruction in undergraduate courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>As examples, a STEP Center might propose a comprehensive effort that uses some combination of the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating model curricula and laboratory programs;</li>
<li>Developing and demonstrating research-based instructional methods and technologies;</li>
<li>Developing methods to train graduate students and/or faculty to be more effective teachers of undergraduates;</li>
<li>Conducting programs to disseminate curricula, instructional methods, or training methods to faculty across the nation; or</li>
<li>Other approaches to achieving the goals of the proposed Center. </li>
</ul>
<p>The intent of a STEP Center should be to make a significant and national impact on the challenge or opportunity being addressed with the expectation that major portions of the impact will be sustained after NSF funding ends.&nbsp; The design of the project should reflect an awareness of the diversity of institutions and curricula that constitute the STEM undergraduate education community in the United States, and the project should include mechanisms for impacting a significant proportion of this community.&nbsp; Projects are expected to encourage broadening the participation of underrepresented students in STEM. All STEP Center proposals should be grounded in the relevant background literature and should show an awareness of relevant prior work in the area.</p>
<p>The STEP Center initiative offers an opportunity for exploring&nbsp;unique efforts&nbsp;in undergraduate STEM education.&nbsp; Thus, projects that are appropriate for existing programs at the National Science Foundation should not be submitted to the STEP Centers competition.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes for all STEP Centers</strong></p>
<p>The outcomes expected of all STEP Centers include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant progress toward addressing the national challenge or opportunity defined in the proposal;</li>
<li>A contribution or potential contribution to expanding the number of students who enroll in undergraduate courses in STEM and to the enhanced learning and retention of&nbsp; students in the courses;</li>
<li>A description of the activities that have been completed and are being sustained by a significant number of academic institutions or other relevant entities;</li>
<li>A description of continued efforts that are expected to occur across the nation as outgrowths of activities undertaken by the project;</li>
<li>A comprehensive evaluation, using the indicators and methods defined in the proposal, that informs the undergraduate STEM community and others about the effectiveness of the project; and</li>
<li>Effective dissemination of the results and products of the project to the academic institutions and other entities that comprise the STEM undergraduate education community.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional expectations and outcomes</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the expectations and outcomes given above for all STEP Centers, more specific information pertains to each of the three categories of STEP Centers.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTORATE FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (EHR-BIO)</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the expectations under <strong>All STEP Centers</strong> and <strong>Outcomes for all STEP Centers</strong>:</p>
<p>Proposals submitted to the EHR-BIO STEP Center competition are expected to focus on current issues that are central to fostering improvement in undergraduate biology education. Many of these issues were the subject of a recent national meeting of stakeholders in undergraduate biology education (&quot;Transforming Undergraduate Biology Education: Mobilizing the Community for Change,&quot; also known as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.visionandchange.org/">Vision &amp; Change meeting</a>).&nbsp; All proposals submitted to the EHR-BIO STEP Center competition should be designed to acknowledge the breadth of the subdisciplines biology encompasses, the rapid changes in the discipline itself, and the diverse aspirations, interests and career goals of both STEM majors and the uniquely large numbers of non-STEM majors populating introductory and, to an extent, upper level biology courses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Specifically, the&nbsp;EHR-BIO STEP Center should focus on either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing the pedagogical skills of higher education faculty; or</li>
<li>Facilitating the work of teams of faculty and administrators to effect departmental or higher-level institutional improvements in undergraduate biology education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cohesive projects addressing both of these areas in a coordinated plan that will result in a significant, national impact will be considered as well.</p>
<p>Although projects including other relevant skills will be considered, projects that include one or more of the following areas are particularly encouraged in proposals focused on the development of pedagogical skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Development of teaching approaches based on an understanding of current knowledge of how students learn; </div>
</li>
<li>Use of assessment of student learning to document student progress toward learning goals, identification of conceptual areas or skills that are particularly challenging to students, followed by appropriate changes in instructional approaches, documenting improvements in student learning across a curriculum, and identifying ways to redesign curricula to meet goals for student learning and competencies;</li>
<li>Use of course content and teaching approaches that reflect ongoing changes in biology including the increasing reliance on sophisticated instrumentation, and interdisciplinary, theoretical, quantitative, modeling, simulation, data integration, and systems approaches in biological discovery and analysis; or</li>
<li>Design of curricula around overarching and unifying concepts, skills and competencies, including innovative ways to integrate scientific research experiences across undergraduate biology curricula.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals focused on faculty-administrator teams acting as institutional agents of change should describe creative, innovative mechanisms for facilitating the work of teams to identify barriers to improvement in undergraduate biology education, and develop and implement mechanisms to overcome the barriers. </p>
<p><strong>DIRECTORATE FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING (EHR-ENG)</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the expectations under <strong>All STEP Centers</strong> and <strong>Outcomes for all STEP Centers</strong>:</p>
<p>Proposals submitted to the EHR-ENG STEP Center competition are expected to address the national imperative to create next generation engineers who are entrepreneurs and innovators. Innovation is crucial to maintaining the dynamism and resilience of the economy, and to harnessing science and technology to address the grand challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs are responsible for a large fraction of new job creation.&nbsp; How can the next generation of engineers be encouraged to be innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders who improve the quality of life and establish the industries and jobs of the future in the United States? </p>
<p>Proposals for the EHR-ENG STEP Center should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw upon the current research literature on the process of innovation, and the process of how people learn to become more innovative;</li>
<li>Demonstrate that students will become more innovative through systematic instruction in innovation and through authentic opportunities that challenge their ability to imagine the future, and develop creative new products, services and processes which will improve that future.&nbsp; Proposals should explain how such opportunities can be offered to large numbers of engineering students throughout their undergraduate experience, and how a large cadre of faculty members functioning as a community will sustain and extend these opportunities. These efforts should go well beyond the traditional curriculum development and implementation effort. </li>
<li>Include plans for dissemination, especially through new strategies for faculty development, widespread implementation and &quot;commercialization&quot; of materials and techniques, which will result in significant adoption in the majority of engineering schools in the United States. New types of partnerships among students, faculty, publishers, media, private foundations, companies, product designers, and venture capitalists are encouraged. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional outcomes for the EHR-ENG STEP Center:</p>
<ul>
<li>More innovative engineers graduating from our universities; </li>
<li>More knowledge about the process of educating innovative engineers; and</li>
<li>A set of instruments and processes for assessing students' innovation skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DIRECTORATE FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES (EHR-GEO)</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the expectations under <strong>All STEP Centers</strong> and <strong>Outcomes for all STEP Centers</strong>:</p>
<p>Projects submitted to the EHR-GEO STEP Center competition should be focused on essential concepts in Earth System Science and its foundational importance in areas such as the interplay of environment, energy, and economics.&nbsp; Global climate change and its attendant socio-economic impacts, contaminated and depleted fresh water systems, depleted energy and mineral resources, ocean acidification, declining fish stocks, and loss of biodiversity are among the important threats to sustainability and global economic stability.&nbsp; Difficult decisions that will require full understanding of the unintended consequences for the planet and its societies lie ahead. Undergraduate students majoring in STEM areas as well as students majoring in economics, business, finance, urban planning, political science and other programs need opportunities to gain a thorough understanding of Earth System Science and its relationship to non-STEM fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Proposals for the EHR-GEO STEP Center should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw upon current research and literature on STEM learning, particularly as it relates to understanding complex, interdisciplinary content and geosciences-relevant concepts such as deep time and evolution;</li>
<li>Seek to incorporate authentic geoscience data in the learning process and illustrate that our understanding of Earth Systems comes through a combination of observation, theoretical studies, and modeling; and,</li>
<li>Serve to educate students about the essential principles and fundamental concepts in the geosciences.&nbsp; These &quot;big ideas&quot; have been&nbsp;articulated in several community-developed framework documents, including&nbsp;&quot;Ocean Literacy: The Essential Principles of Ocean Sciences&quot;; &quot;Climate Literacy: The Essential Principles of Climate Science&quot;; &quot;Earth Science Literacy&quot;; and &quot;Atmospheric Science Literacy&quot; [available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/adgeo/education.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/geo/adgeo/education.jsp</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected components for the EHR-GEO STEP Center include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development and testing of new, and scalable, model programs that provide undergraduate students and faculty with substantial exposure to core concepts within the Earth, Atmospheric, and Marine sciences; </li>
<li>Creation and evaluation of learning materials that link the fundamental concepts of Earth System Science to core theories and information in non-STEM fields; </li>
<li>Evaluation of appropriate pedagogies for teaching Earth System Science linked to other non-STEM disciplines; and, </li>
<li>Professional development opportunities to improve the capacity of faculty and teaching assistants in STEM and non-STEM areas to fully understand the linkages between Earth System Science and other non-STEM fields. </li>
</ul>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
</h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
</p>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>In considering the above criteria, reviewers will be asked to comment on the following for all STEP Center proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>How significant is the national challenge or opportunity that is being addressed? </li>
<li>To what extent are the proposed project activities likely to successfully impact the national challenge or opportunity?</li>
<li>To what extent is the proposed project addressing the diversity of institutions and curricula that constitute the STEM undergraduate education community?</li>
<li>How realistic are the expectations for the courses that are expected to see expanded enrollments of students, enhanced learning by students in the courses, and increased retention of students in the courses?&nbsp; </li>
<li>To what extent is the proposed project encouraging broadening the participation of underrepresented students in STEM?</li>
<li>How likely are the project activities and outcomes to be sustained by a significant number of academic institutions or other relevant entities?</li>
<li>To what extent are continued efforts likely to occur across the nation as outgrowths of activities undertaken by the project? </li>
<li>Is the management plan appropriate to accomplish the goals of&nbsp;the proposed project?</li>
<li>Are the proposed indicators and methods appropriate for measuring the success of the project and informing the undergraduate STEM community and others about the effectiveness of the project?</li>
<li>To what extent is the plan for dissemination likely to spread the results and products of the project to the academic institutions and other entities that comprise the STEM undergraduate education community?</li>
</ul>
<p>For only those proposals being submitted to the EHR-ENG STEP Center competition, in addition to addressing the questions above, the reviewers will be asked to comment on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent is the project likely to lead to the graduation of more innovative engineers?</li>
<li>How likely is information to be learned about the process of educating innovative engineers? </li>
<li>How appropriate are the types of instruments and processes that are expected to be developed for assessing students' innovation skills?</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;Panel Review. </p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
</p>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report&nbsp;will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
<p>Principal Investigators will be required to participate in evaluation activities related to NSF's program evaluations.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
