        <blockquote>
          <P>NSF is supporting construction
              of the Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), a scalable, distributed,
              heterogeneous grid computing-communication-information system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled
              for commissioning in the fall of 2004, the&nbsp;ETF will provide
              for the seamless integration of high end computing platforms, large
              archival science and engineering data resources, cutting-edge visualization
              facilities, and research-enabling instruments and sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
              the resulting state-of-the-art digital knowledge environment, researchers
              and educators will collaborate, create and promulgate new science
          and engineering knowledge across distance, time and fields of expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
          The ETF is being implemented through
          a series of coordinated NSF investments that began in FY 2000 with
          the Terascale Computing System(TCS) and continued in FY 2001 with support
          of the Distributed Terascale Facility (DTF).&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2002,
          TCS and DTF resources were integrated via an extensible, high-speed
          optical backbone, thereby creating the Extensible Terascale Facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
          the NSF ETF activity, current partners include Argonne National Laboratory,
          the Center for Advanced Computing Research (CACR) at the California
          Institute of Technology, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
          (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, the Pittsburgh
          Supercomputing Center (PSC) and the San Diego Supercomputing Center
          (SDSC).&nbsp;
          <P>In this announcement, NSF is
              seeking proposals from organizations wishing to join the current
              partners in realizing the ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
              partner organizations will share their existing science and engineering
              computing-communication-information resources with users via high
              bandwidth network connections to the ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources
              provided for sharing must clearly contribute to the ETF vision
              and must provide added scientific value to the national ETF user
              community. Examples of such resources include, but are not limited
              to, large shared data repositories or digital libraries, science
              and/or engineering research instruments, computational resources,
              and sensor networks that are engaged in collecting, archiving,
          and analyzing large quantities of experimental data.</P>
          <P>Awards made will fund the high-speed
              networking connection of resources provided for sharing by new
              ETF partner organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding will&nbsp;<B>not</B>&nbsp;be
              provided for the creation and/or enhancement of resources to be
              connected to ETF.</P>

      <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <P>NSF is committed to exploiting
            the potential of computing, communication and information technologies
            to revolutionize the conduct of science and engineering research
            and education. As described in the recently-released report of the
            NSF <A href="http://www.cise.nsf.gov/evnt/reports/atkins_annc_020303.htm">Advisory
            Committee for Cyberinfrastructure</A>, this revolution promises discoveries
            currently unrealizable, a greatly enhanced understanding of the universe
            in which we live, and technological innovation in areas of great
            consequence to society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through ubiquitous, persistent
            communication networks, scientists and engineers throughout the nation
            will have instantaneous access to a range of state-of-the-art computing-communication-information
            resources such as computational engines, data repositories, digital
            libraries, sensors and field-specific instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,

      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <P>NSF is supporting construction of the
            Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF) as one of the first demonstrations
            of a state-of-the-art, widely-shared, grid-enabled, computing-communication-information
            system. The ETF architecture permits the seamless integration of
            computing platforms, large archival science and engineering data
            resources, visualization facilities, and research-enabling instruments
            and sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;ETF architectural details are described in <A href="http://www.teragrid.org/TeraGrid-Primer-Sept-02.pdf">The
        TERAGRID: a Primer</A><I>.</I></P>
        <P>The ETF is being implemented through
            a series of coordinated NSF investments that began in FY 2000 with
            the Terascale Computing System (TCS) and continued in FY 2001 with
            support of the Distributed Terascale Facility (DTF).&nbsp;&nbsp;In
            FY 2002, TCS and DTF resources were integrated via an extensible,
            high-speed optical backbone, thereby creating the Extensible Terascale
            Facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the NSF ETF activity, current partners
            include Argonne National Laboratory, the Center for Advanced Computing
            Research (CACR) at the California Institute of Technology, the National
            Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
            Illinois at Urbana Champaign, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
        (PSC) and the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC).</P>
        <P>The ETF currently comprises the following
        computing-communication-information resources and services:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>compute engines: over 20 teraflops of computing capacity at PSC,
            SDSC and NCSA;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>storage: almost 1 petabyte of managed disk storage at NCSA and
            SDSC;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>remote rendering and visualization: provided by a 180-node visualization
            cluster at Argonne National Laboratory;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>data collection and analysis: centered around a data server at
            CACR; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>a high-speed optical backbone: a 40 Gbit/s backbone runs between
            Chicago and Los Angeles. Large extensible hubs located in Chicago
            and Los Angeles connect to ETF resources at five partner sites (Argonne
            National Lab, CACR, NCSA, PSC and SDSC) over 30 Gb/sec connections
            so that the bandwidth between any two sites is at least 30 Gb/sec.&nbsp;</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>In this announcement, NSF is soliciting
            proposals from organizations seeking to become partners in the ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposing
            organizations must commit to share a portion of their existing science
            and/or engineering computing-communication-information resources
            with ETF users to enhance the utility of ETF. &nbsp;In return, the
            ETF will provide researchers and educators currently utilizing new
            partner resources with high bandwidth connectivity to and seamless
            integration with a wide range of ETF computational, data and visualization
        resources, including those described above.&nbsp;</P>
        <P>New ETF partners might contribute existing:</P>

            when made broadly available, promise breakthroughs at the science
            and engineering frontier;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>digital libraries, where the digital content contained therein
            promises unique contributions to discovery, learning and innovation;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>computational resources or existing wide-area, grid-enabled computational
            facilities that further enhance the computational capacity and/or
            heterogeneity of ETF;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>large distributed sensor networks, unique research instruments
            and/or large-scale research facilities that will provide experimental
            and/or computed data of significant interest to a community of scientists
            and engineers; and/or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>other significant computing-communication-information resources
            and services that enhance the utility of ETF and contribute to realization
            of a state-of-the-art, heterogeneous digital knowledge environment.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>Through funding available in FY 2003, the awardee resources to be
          shared will be integrated with existing ETF resources. NSF funding

      <P>Proposals submitted in response
          to this solicitation must include the following information in the
      15 page project description:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The Scientific Opportunity:&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide
            detailed information on the nature of the resource(s) to be connected&nbsp;to
            the ETF and the extent to which this resource will be shared with
            ETF users.&nbsp;&nbsp;Describe how the shared resource(s) will enhance
            or complement the resources currently available within the ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Describe
            how integration of the resource(s) into the ETF will provide the
            science and/or engineering research and education community with
        a unique opportunity to promote discovery, learning and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
        <LI>Connecting to and Integrating
            with ETF: Provide detailed plans that describe how the resource(s)
            to be shared will be connected to and integrated with current ETF
            resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;ETF connections will require: 1) equipment
            to connect to one of the two ETF hub routers located in Chicago and
            Los Angeles; 2) a high bandwidth connection consisting of single
            or multiple 10 Gb/s links from either of the two ETF hubs to the
            resource site; and 3)&nbsp;border routers located at the resource
            site to connect the resource local area network to ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections
            can be made either by purchasing dedicated fiber or by negotiating
            a multiple year lease through a commercial service provider. ETF
            partner site connections must be compatible at all levels with the
            existing ETF architecture and grid-enabled operating environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide
            technical specifications of the networking hardware requested, a
            timetable for the implementation, and a justification for any FTEs
        that will be required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
        <LI>Maintenance and Operations Plan:
            Describe how the current resource(s) is(are) maintained and operated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide
            evidence that you have sufficient local area network and grid-enabled
            computing expertise to manage and operate the ETF-shared resource(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
            NSF anticipates that ETF partners will participate in ETF for a minimum
            of 5 years following ETF commissioning, provide a five-year estimate
            of the maintenance and operations support necessary to maintain the
            ETF connection and to maintain and operate the portion of the resource(s)
            allocated for sharing on ETF.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <P>All proposers are urged to thoroughly
              study and understand the implications and compatibility requirements

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
      <p>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsb9772">NSB
        97-72</a>). All NSF proposals
        are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances,
        however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight
        the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </p>
      <p>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</a>, Implementation
        of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts
        Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing
        both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted
        to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure
        that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding
        decisions.</p>
      <p>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
      <p>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>
      <p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p>
      <ul>
        <b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </ul>
      <p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br />
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br />
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <span class="user_input"> <a name="rev_addl_crit_txt"></a> <b>Additional
        Review Criteria</b><P>As part of their consideration
            of the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposed projects,
            reviewers will be directed to address the following issues in their
            reviews.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>To what extent will the resource(s) to be connected
              enhance or complement the resources currently available within
              the ETF for the benefit of the science and engineering research
              and education community?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>What are the anticipated benefits to the organization
              proposing to share existing resource(s) on the ETF?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Does the proposing organization have the demonstrated
              networking and grid expertise to implement and maintain the proposed
              connection to the ETF?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Does the proposal contain a well-reasoned work
              plan and timeline for implementation of the proposed connection
              and integration?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Is the five-year maintenance
              and operation plan consistent with the scientific value-added the
              resource(s) will bring to ETF users?</LI>
        </UL>
        </span>
      </ul>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <span class="user_input"> <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a> Panel
        Review. </span></p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</p>
      <p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer,  Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</p>
