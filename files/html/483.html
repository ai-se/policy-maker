            <p>Proposals are solicited to manage and operate the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). NOAO is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and operated by a managing organization under cooperative agreement with NSF.  NOAO is a national center for research in ground-based, nighttime, optical and infrared (O/IR) astronomy for the U.S. astronomical community.  </p>
            <p>NOAO's core mission is to facilitate access for all qualified professional researchers to state-of-the-art observational capabilities and data bases in O/IR astronomy, and to enable the U.S. research community to pursue a broad range of modern astrophysical challenges from small bodies within the Solar System, to the most distant galaxies in the early Universe, to indirect observations of dark energy and dark matter. </p>
            <p>The awardee will work closely with NSF and the scientific community to ensure that NOAO continues to support, sustain and advance frontier science as enabled by unique research capabilities and as promoted through a culture of excellence. In cooperation with NSF and within available resources, NOAO will plan and execute a viable, coherent and inclusive program to facilitate research and education, consistent with the objectives and priorities of the scientific community. The awardee will manage facilities and equipment provided by NSF in accord with the scope and funding described in this solicitation.  NOAO is a multidisciplinary and multiuser resource, and its programs will be carried out in collaboration with its stakeholder communities. </p>
            <p>Proposals should describe how the proposing organization(s) will provide access to observing capabilities and scientific data; facilitate an integrated program of research, education, training and outreach; maintain instruments, facilities and infrastructure; manage and develop a skilled and diverse workforce; and establish appropriate partnerships with academic institutions, industry, private organizations and the international community to support the NOAO mission.</p>
            <p>Within available resources and as consistent with the expectations and criteria identified in this solicitation, the successful proposal will present a compelling, sustainable vision for NOAO that supports an optimal suite of community-driven research and education activities through effective structures for management and operations.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National Science Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF supports facilities that provide research capabilities in various scientific disciplines. One such facility, the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) provides services and facilities to support research in ground-based optical and infrared (O/IR) astronomy. </p>
          <p>
            NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) has determined that in order to implement its strategic programmatic goals for supporting O/IR astronomy in the next decade, to accommodate the changing needs of the astronomical community, to preserve high priority components of its portfolio, and to do this under constrained budget projections, there must be a funding reduction at NOAO that results in a re-baselined scope, and the mission adjusted accordingly. Anticipated NSF funding for future management and operations of NOAO is reduced relative to recent levels. NSF intends to fully fund the baseline scope as defined in Section II.A.3 in this solicitation. Proposing organizations are encouraged to present creative, but realizable, plans to deal with the budget exigencies imposed on the baseline scope. </p>
          <p>This solicitation is solely for the management and operation of NOAO.  Management and operation of the International Gemini Observatory and management of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) construction project are not included in this solicitation.  The concept of LSST operations and its management will be an evolving effort during LSST construction. Hence, LSST operations is not a component of this solicitation.     </p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
   
          <p><strong>A</strong><strong>. Description of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory</strong></p>
          <p>1.     Overview </p>
          <p>NOAO is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), sponsored by the NSF and operated by a managing organization under cooperative agreement with NSF.  NOAO is a national center for research in ground-based, nighttime, optical and infrared astronomy for the U.S. astronomical community.  </p>
          <p>NOAO's<em> </em>core mission is to facilitate access for all qualified professional researchers to state-of-the-art observational capabilities and data bases in O/IR astronomy, and to enable the U.S. research community to pursue a broad range of modern astrophysical challenges from small bodies within the Solar System, to the most distant galaxies in the early Universe, to indirect observations of dark energy and dark matter.  </p>
          <p>NOAO serves as a national resource for the scientific community. NOAO operates administrative, laboratory, and O/IR facilities at locations in Arizona and in Region IV (Coquimbo) of northern Chile, and manages observatory sites at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. It is the gateway for the U.S. astronomical community to the International Gemini Observatory through the U.S. National Gemini Office (US-NGO), and to other U.S. O/IR telescopes that offer public access.  It coordinates community access to telescopes throughout the U.S. O/IR system, and it facilitates connecting the scientific user to the data repository by developing and maintaining data management capabilities. NOAO integrates community planning for facilities and instrumentation under a national organization. It manages national community involvement in the development of potential future facility and infrastructure projects.  NOAO has participated in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project from its inception and is currently involved in the design, development, and future construction of LSST. </p>
          <p>A large number of U.S. colleges and universities operate their own astronomical facilities at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in Arizona and at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile with contracted supporting services provided by NOAO.  Development of new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques by NOAO is carried out in partnership with universities and with industry through subawards to aerospace, optical fabrication, and information technology companies.  NOAO leverages NSF support with funding from other federal agencies and non-federal sources.  In FY 2012, in addition to NSF base operations and maintenance funding, NOAO received $10,300,000 for reimbursed services from partnerships and tenant observatory support, from the Kitt Peak Visitors' Center, from NSF grants for the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, and grants from other federal agencies. </p>
          <p>In addition to facilitating research by the scientific community, the NOAO Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program promotes public understanding of science, education, and training at all levels, especially within groups that have been historically underrepresented in the U.S. physics and astronomy science enterprise.  NOAO has a diverse education program, visitor centers, and a web-based information portal at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.noao.edu/">www.noao.edu</a>. Many of the education and outreach activities are funded from sources outside of the NOAO base operations and maintenance budget, such as public donations and grants from other NSF programs.  Much of the public visitor program is self supporting through visitor fees. </p>
          <p>In the new award period, NOAO should focus on its role as a national-level resource for the community. As a national center, NOAO is expected to integrate service to the community into its mission and to add value to the U.S. astronomy enterprise through facilitating community access to observational capabilities, post-observational services, and management of data bases.  NOAO may retain on-staff technical and engineering expertise that is made available to the community. The cost of work for others must be fully and equitably allocated to those cost objectives.  This contract expertise may assist the community in developing instrumentation and supporting resources for facilities that they own and operate.  </p>
          <p>Through this solicitation, NSF intends to define a basic framework for NOAO on which to build during the award period as funding opportunities might materialize and as various projects that are in planning or construction become operational.  In this solicitation, NSF provides a guidance level of funding for the baseline scope. Responders to this solicitation should propose to manage the baseline scope for NOAO as described in Section II.A.3. There may be opportunities during the award period for increasing the NSF-funded scope of NOAO as planned U.S.-led facilities progress toward operation, if these include a compelling vision for an NOAO role in facilitating community participation. </p>
          <p>2.  Transformation from Current NOAO (NOAO-2013) to New NOAO (NOAO-2016)</p>
          <p>The FY 2013 NOAO operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) budget from NSF/AST is $25,500,000. The budget target for FY 2016 is $17,500,000.  This section outlines the process for the transformation of NOAO-2013 to NOAO-2016.</p>
          <p>With guidance from NSF, AURA will finalize an NOAO transformation plan that is to be carried out in FY 2014 and 2015.  The Program Plan for the transformation is to be submitted to NSF in October 2013.  It will be posted in the Resource Library for this solicitation and updated as needed.  The transition should be substantially complete by the end of FY 2015.  The primary consequence of the decreased funding for NOAO is a reduction or discontinuance of activities which results in a significant reduction from current levels in personnel carried on NSF funds for NOAO O&amp;M.  Since the guidance budget level for NOAO is such a significant reduction from current levels, proposing organizations should take great care in matching staffing in their proposed operation to available funding.  Current staffing levels will be reported in the Resource Library that NSF will maintain for prospective proposers.  </p>
          <p>The one exception to the transformation schedule given above is with regard to the Mayall telescope on Kitt Peak.  Mayall operations costs are not included in the baseline NOAO budget for FY 2016 (Sec. 3). However, NSF anticipates that it may be necessary to continue NSF funding for Mayall operations through FY 2016 and possibly FY 2017 in order to facilitate a smooth transition to an anticipated new funding source.  In this event, NSF will add supplementary funds to the Kitt Peak operations budget in 2016 and possibly 2017 that are targeted specifically to continue Mayall operations at a constant level of effort and to bridge the Mayall from NSF support to a new source of operating funds.  If these NSF funds are necessary, they will be an addition to the baseline O&amp;M funding for NOAO. The amount of NSF funds needed may not be known until 2015.  Proposers should not include operation of the Mayall in the baseline scope of their proposal. Nevertheless, they should describe how they would handle continued operation of the Mayall as an add-on from NSF in the first two years of the award for continuing the current operations model, and then in subsequent years providing contracted NOAO technical services in support of operating the Mayall with a non-NSF source of funding. The status of the Mayall will be kept up-to-date in the Program Plan for the transformation that is posted on the Resource Library. </p>
          <p>3.  Baseline Scope for NOAO </p>
          <p>This section describes the scope for NOAO that NSF intends to fund through this solicitation and to which responders to this solicitation should propose to manage, and provides guidance on the allocation of the budget.  In defining the baseline scope, NSF considers NOAO to be comprised of three major administrative units: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NOAO Core - scientific, technical, administrative integration &amp; coordination (currently at NOAO headquarters in Tucson, AZ) </li>
            <li>Kitt Peak Operations - Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO); all responsibilities on the mountain </li>
            <li>Chilean Operations (CO) - La Serena labs and administrative offices; Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO); Cerro Pach&oacute;n facilities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposers are welcome to describe other organizational structures for NOAO as long as they are consistent with and support the NOAO mission.  </p>
          <p>NSF/AST anticipates providing $17,500,000 total O&amp;M funding for NOAO for FY 2016.  As guidance for distributing these funds across the organization, proposers should limit the allocation of funding for Kitt Peak Operations to a target of about $1,000,000 per year and for Chilean Operations to a target of about $7,500,000 per year. Within the NOAO Core, approximately $700,000 must be budgeted for the U.S. National Gemini Office (US-NGO). </p>
          <p><strong>NOAO Core. </strong> NSF has determined that within a total NOAO annual O&amp;M budget of $17,500,000, a target of approximately $9,000,000 is an appropriate allocation to maintain the basic core, central observatory functions, and operate as a national resource for consolidated services to the community.  </p>
          <p>The NOAO Core performs the integration of the scientific, technical, and administrative support functions that serve the organization as a whole, as well as provide services to the community.  NOAO Core functions are at present co-located with the NOAO headquarters offices and labs in Tucson, AZ, but that need not be the case in the new award period.  The Tucson facilities are located in buildings owned by the NSF on the campus of the University of Arizona. The National Solar Observatory (NSO), Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST), and LSST project share office and laboratory space with NOAO, and each pays its share of the building operating costs.  </p>
          <p>NOAO Core functions should include items such as central administration and business services, including human resources and management costs and fees; environment, safety, &amp; health (ES&amp;H); physical plant (building) operating costs; information transfer and communications (ITC) systems; central instrumentation labs; and community support services, such as the US-NGO.  Other NOAO Core functions that proposers might consider include community/system science and data center, including data management; facilitating community access to current and future facility and instrument capabilities; community/system technology and instrumentation development; covering the costs of public access time on telescopes on Kitt Peak; engagement with, and coordination of, the O/IR system; strategic and long-range planning for the field; and education and public outreach (EPO).  With due consideration of the guidance provided, potential managing organizations are free to propose to allocate the budget to cover the core functions as they believe to be most effective. Proposers are encouraged to (re)define the services to be provided to the community within the available budget.  </p>
          <p>No NOAO base funds are targeted for the LSST project in 2016.  There are currently funds in the NOAO Core for LSST design and development.  However, FY 2014 or 2015 is expected to be the last year for that funding line, provided that LSST enters the NSF MREFC line during one of those years. Continuing funding for LSST design and development is provided by NSF through a separate funding stream to the LSST Project Office through AURA. </p>
          <p>It is unlikely that the budget for the Core will be sufficient to accommodate an in-house scientific research staff.  Proposing organizations are encouraged to provide creative ideas on ways and means of engaging community scientists in NOAO planning and operations. </p>
          <p>The US-NGO provides services to U.S. astronomers who propose to use one or both of the Gemini Observatory 8.2-meter telescopes located on Mauna Kea, HI, and Cerro Pach&oacute;n in Chile. The US-NGO is a unit within NOAO, and the funding for the service functions is included in the NOAO base budget.  The scope of the US-NGO and the funding for that scope are determined through discussion among Gemini management, NOAO, and NSF.  It is expected that the US-NGO will continue to be supported at a level between $500,000 and $700,000 per year (to be determined between NSF and the managing organization) out of the NOAO base budget.  The services currently include assisting community members with all phases of proposal preparation, understanding instrumental capabilities, planning observations, awarding of telescope time for the U.S. community, data acquisition, and data reduction. </p>
          <p>O/IR system support activities are to be included in the NOAO Core. NOAO facilitates access to other U.S. ground-based O/IR telescopes whereby time on non-federal telescopes is made available to the community, most recently through NSF funding via the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP) and the Renewing Small Telescopes for Astronomical Research (ReSTAR) program.  While both the TSIP and ReSTAR program are not currently active, a number of public access nights on non-federal telescopes made available through these programs remain to be assigned because of still pending instrumentation or telescope development.  NOAO conducts merit reviews of proposals for such telescope time and assigns the time via their Time Allocation Committee (TAC) process. </p>
          <p><strong>Kitt Peak Operations </strong>are expected to be administered through the NOAO subunit Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO).  KPNO is located approximately 56 miles (90 km) southwest of Tucson, Arizona, and situated on approximately 2,308 acres (935 hectares) of land on Kitt Peak leased to NSF by the Tohono O'odham Nation for as long as the &quot;premises are used for astronomical study and research or related scientific purposes.&quot;  NSF reaffirms a need to maintain the Kitt Peak infrastructure for astronomical research and public outreach for the foreseeable future.  </p>
          <p>NSF expects KPNO to be the steward of all astronomical research and public outreach activities on Kitt Peak that are within the geographic area of the lease that NSF has with the Tohono O'odham.  In this capacity, KPNO will maintain the basic infrastructure for the tenants to carry out astronomical research on their facilities, be responsible for implementing environmental, safety, and health practices on the mountain, and maintain a working relationship with the Tohono O'odham.  Services include water supply, utilities, telecommunications (including internet), physical plant and roads maintenance. To the extent practicable, the costs of these services will be reimbursed to KPNO through tenant fees.  NOAO is currently preparing a Kitt Peak Mountain Operations Model in which all telescope facilities on the mountain will be considered to be tenants. The Model fully describes and costs all of the services to be provided to tenants. Tenant agreements for services will be posted on the Resource Library. The Mountain Operations Model will be part of the NOAO Transformation Plan, and it will be posted on the Resource Library.  KPNO may also maintain a basic pool of on-staff engineering and technical expertise to be contracted to tenants, but only to the extent that full costs are recovered from tenant contracts.  Although NSF/AST will not provide base operations support for any telescopes on Kitt Peak, it will retain title to telescopes it currently owns while their operating costs may be paid by non-NSF sources.  If funds are available in the NOAO budget or from other sources and if the demand is adequately justified, NOAO may arrange to cover the incremental operating costs to obtain observing time on any tenant telescope to be made available to the community as open access time. The Awardee will oversee KPNO's role in managing the Mountain Operations Model.  </p>
          <p>NSF estimates that funding at a target of $1,000,000 should be sufficient to carry out KPNO's baseline stewardship responsibilities, in which all facilities on Kitt Peak are considered to be tenants. There is one caveat to the funding target for KPNO.  As described in section II.A.2, NSF may need to add some funding in support of Mayall operations through FY 2016 and possibly FY 2017 as a bridge to a non-NSF source of funding. The level of funding may not be known until 2015.</p>
          <p>KPNO currently hosts the facilities of consortia which operate more than 20 telescopes (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.noao.edu/kpno/tenants">www.noao.edu/kpno/tenants</a>).  These tenants reimburse NOAO, on a cost-recovery basis, for infrastructure support as well as technical services.</p>
          <p>The 4-m Mayall telescope is owned by NSF, but after 2016 it will no longer be operated solely as a community access telescope. NSF has received a letter from the Department of Energy (DOE) indicating that the Mayall telescope is their preferred site for hosting a Mid-Scale Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. NSF and DOE currently are working to determine the terms and conditions under which the Mayall telescope may be made available for the DOE project. In this event, NSF would retain ownership of the telescope, the non-NSF funds would be used to provide support to NOAO for maintenance and operation of the telescope, and the Mayall would be treated as a tenant facility on Kitt Peak.  NOAO may retain scientific and technical involvement in projects conducted on the Mayall and other telescopes on the mountain and in data obtained from projects, depending on availability of telescope time and funding (from NOAO or otherwise) and on community driven interest in open access time.  </p>
          <p>The other major telescope on Kitt Peak is the WIYN 3.5-m.  The WIYN telescope is operated by a consortium comprising University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, Yale University, and NOAO.  WIYN delivers excellent image quality, and its performance benefits from newer technology in telescope and dome design, and mirror support.  Currently NOAO directly supports WIYN operations and has a 40% share in the WIYN telescope time, which is made available for community access through the NOAO Time Allocation Committee (TAC) process.  However, it is expected no NSF funds will be used to support the base operation of WIYN during the new award period.  </p>
          <p>The 2.1-m telescope on Kitt Peak is owned by NSF and is currently operated for community access by NOAO with NSF funds. It is expected that during FY 2014 or 2015 the telescope will either be closed or operations taken over by non-NSF funding sources. NSF expects to retain ownership of the 2.1-m even if there is a non-NSF source of funding for operations.  </p>
          <p><strong>Chilean Operations (CO)</strong> include a complex of astronomical telescopes, instruments, labs, and administrative offices. The facilities include offices and labs in La Serena, Chile (about 300 miles (500 km) north of Santiago), as well as astronomical observing sites on Cerro Tololo (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, CTIO) and on Cerro Pach&oacute;n, approximately 37 miles (60 km) from La Serena.  NOAO operates in Chile under Chilean law, through an Agreement with the University of Chile and under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile. The Agreement is posted in the Resource Library.  </p>
          <p>All of the land on which NOAO's Chilean facilities reside is owned by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), a U.S. non-profit corporation.  The La Serena compound is approximately 32 acres (13 hectares), and the properties on Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pach&oacute;n total approximately 91,500 acres (37,000 hectares).  The current Cooperative Agreement (CA) between NSF and AURA stipulates: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>In the event that AURA ceases to be the managing organization for the NOAO Project, AURA agrees that it shall enter into a lease agreement with a successor managing organization(s) designated by NSF . . . Such lease arrangement will be made available to the successor organization(s) at a rate of $1 per year for as long as such property is used and maintained for astronomical research.</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>NSF anticipates an annual budget at a target of approximately $7,500,000 for Chilean Operations should be sufficient for NOAO's stewardship and telescope operations responsibilities in Chile.  Chilean Operations is responsible for operating the 4-m Blanco Telescope on Cerro Tololo and the 4.1-m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope on Cerro Pach&oacute;n, about 9 miles (15 km) from Cerro Tololo and the office and laboratory infrastructure in La Serena.  The stewardship responsibilities are to maintain basic infrastructure and support services for the tenants.  The costs to Chilean Operations of providing this support will be reimbursed by the users in the form of fees and contracts for services to the extent practicable, all according to agreements in place between NOAO and the tenants.  Gemini Observatory and LSST project facilities are also located on the AURA owned property in La Serena and on Cerro Pach&oacute;n, and NOAO Chilean Operations provides services on a cost reimbursable basis.  </p>
          <p>The Blanco telescope is primarily available for community open access time.  Beginning in late 2013, 105 nights per year on the Blanco will be dedicated to the Dark Energy Survey for a five-year period. Outside of the time dedicated to the survey, there is community time available using the Dark Energy Survey camera and other instrumentation designed to exploit the capabilities of the telescope. </p>
          <p>The SOAR telescope is operated by a partnership comprising NOAO, Michigan State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Minist&eacute;rio da Ci&ecirc;ncia e Tecnologia, e Inova&ccedil;&atilde;o of the Federal Republic of Brazil.  NOAO has a 30% share of the time on SOAR, which is made available to the astronomical community through the NOAO Telescope Allocation Committee (TAC) process. The SOAR partnership agreement runs through 2018.  According to the provisions of the agreement, approximately $2,000,000 per year of the NOAO Chilean Operations budget goes to the operation of SOAR.  The future of the SOAR partnership beyond 2018 will be the subject of discussions and negotiations among the current partners and NSF.  </p>
          <p>In addition to the telescopes it operates directly, NOAO's Chilean Operations provides services to more than 10 other telescopes and astronomical projects as tenants on a cost reimbursable basis. The list is included in the Resource Library. NOAO receives a modest amount of telescope time for community access on some of these telescopes. NOAO also hosts non-astronomical activities such as a seismic station of the University of Chile.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Description of Awardee Responsibilities</strong></p>
          <p>1. Responsibilities </p>
          <p>The Awardee shall be responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) in accordance with the proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and according to Annual Program Operating Plans submitted to NSF.  The Awardee shall be responsible for the overall welfare of NOAO and for maximizing the benefits to the astronomical community of NOAO resources. Note that, as described below, the Awardee shall be the employer of NOAO base operations staff, including Chilean employees, in accordance with the labor laws of the country or state of the site of employment.   </p>
          <p>The Awardee shall be responsible for the planning, initiation, and execution of programs and activities designed to optimally serve the interests of the U.S. scientific community involved in ground-based O/IR astronomy. The Awardee will work closely with NSF and the astronomical and broader science community to ensure that the activities carried out at and by NOAO strongly reflect community needs and priorities. In discharging these responsibilities, the Awardee shall ensure that the character and reputation of NOAO as a national resource are maintained, and that it enables first-rate visitor and archival research, while also pursuing leading community-based initiatives in the relevant disciplines. </p>
          <p>More specifically the Awardee is responsible for: </p>
          <p>a. Operating and maintaining the NOAO buildings and facilities, developing and incorporating new facilities, planning for future new initiatives, supporting a skilled and diverse work force and sustaining an innovative and vigorous program of basic and applied research in support of the astronomical and related sciences. </p>
          <p>b. The overall performance of NOAO and for ensuring that, within the resources available, NOAO fulfills all aspects of its mission with a visionary and productive program of world-class services, infrastructure and research support in the interests of the U.S. astronomical and broader science community. </p>
          <p>c. Activities at NOAO facilities that are funded by both NSF and NOAO's other program funding agencies and organizations. Non-NSF programs managed by the Awardee must be consistent with the NOAO mission, and complement and enhance activities funded and approved by NSF. </p>

          </ul>
          <p>4. Important Considerations in Preparation of a Proposal</p>
          <p>The Awardee is expected to implement a business plan for the management and operation of NOAO, that is described in the proposal and that will adhere to the highest standards for managing the general operations and workforce of a complex scientific organization. The business plan is expected to include descriptions of:  the organizational structure and the lines of authority and responsibility within the organization; provisions for business and human resources services; staffing policies and the staffing required to operate the organization within the funding provided; a workforce management plan; procedures for budgeting within the organization; the accounting system with the procedures for auditing and oversight; and the process for planning future operations and initiatives.  </p>
          <p>Within the context of presenting a business plan for the management and operation of NOAO, proposers should give special consideration to the following areas of awardee responsibility. The Project Description section of the proposal should be structured to map the following  items a. through e.  Items a. through e. map to the Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria 1. through 5.  in Section VI.A.2.</p>
          <p>a.  Management.  The Awardee will define and implement an organizational structure for NOAO that will provide vision, leadership and service to manage NOAO as a vibrant, community-serving, multi-user facility that is an effective national resource.  Models and approaches for observatory management should be consistent with the goals of serving the needs of the scientific community and meeting the requirements described in this solicitation. Organizational structures for NOAO management may include the establishment of new institutions, corporations or consortia, provided that the proposing organization(s) provide materials in support of the financial capability of the awardee(s), as required in Section V.B. The Awardee will establish and maintain business services procedures that adhere to best practice standards and that satisfy NSF review.  </p>
          <p>The Awardee will establish and maintain an effective governance and advisory structure to provide guidance, advice and oversight for all NOAO activities, consistent with its vision, goals, and objectives. The Awardee's advisory structure should enable diverse representation from all sectors served by NOAO, and should include mechanisms to assess and advise on all aspects of NOAO including management, research, education and outreach, technical capabilities, project management, and human resources. </p>
          <p>The Awardee will establish processes within a structured framework for planning, review and performance management, including the development and use of appropriate mechanisms to aid both the managing organization and NOAO's stakeholders in assessing performance and identifying areas for improvement. </p>
          <p>b.  Operations, maintenance, environmental, safety, health, and security. The Awardee will be responsible for staffing and managing NOAO to ensure that community service functions, and NOAO telescope, instruments, and data facilities are able to operate in response to high-priority scientific research conducted by qualified scientists. To this end the Awardee will articulate a strategic plan for maintaining a viable, community-driven scope of observatory operations and will employ mechanisms for reviewing and scheduling user access through an open, merit-based process. </p>
          <p>The Awardee will provide a data management plan that describes the acquisition, analysis, archiving and accessibility of all NOAO data, including the definition of proprietary periods and appropriate cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity. </p>
          <p>All parts of the NOAO infrastructure that are necessary to meet the proposed operations activities will be competently maintained to enable the attainment of program objectives and for the safety and security of staff and visitors. The Awardee will be responsible for budgeting, scheduling and tracking a comprehensive safety, environmental compliance, and maintenance plan for all parts of the NOAO infrastructure, including plans, as appropriate, to remove or dispose of those parts of the infrastructure deemed unnecessary for the proposed level of operations. </p>
          <p>c.  Budgeting, staffing, and workforce management.  The Awardee will demonstrate competence in managing the budget of a complex organization through the business plan for managing and operating NOAO, a description of which is to be included in the proposal.  </p>
          <p>The Awardee will demonstrate the capability and authority to conduct operations in Chile, including employment of Chileans. Recognizing that obtaining the necessary authority may require an extended time period, the proposer must demonstrate knowledge of what is required to obtain the necessary authorities, if they do not already have such authority.  </p>
          <p>NOAO offers significant potential to enable the participation of traditionally underrepresented and underserved communities in the research and education mission of the Observatory and to strengthen the strategic growth of a scientific and technically trained workforce in the regions in which it operates. The Awardee will demonstrate leadership in employing best practices for broadening participation in science and engineering at all levels within NOAO's activities.</p>
          <p>d.  Science and facility planning.  The Awardee will define a Long-Range Plan (typically 5-yr) and an annual Program Operating Plan for NOAO that demonstrates responsiveness to community-based scientific objectives, an innovative vision built on existing and potential capabilities of NOAO and O/IR system resources that NOAO coordinates, a well defined scope of high-priority activities, and a credible plan within available resources to support the proposed suite of activities. </p>
          <p>As described by the proposed program and within available funds, the Awardee will ensure that NOAO has sufficient internal or external expertise to (1) support community users, (2) help guide decisions relating to current and future instrumentation and operating modes, (3) develop and maintain data acquisition, data management, and data processing systems, (4) develop and implement policies and strategies for data accessibility and data archiving, and (5) validate data of on-going research programs. </p>
          <p>e.  Education and Public Outreach.  NOAO currently operates a vigorous program of education and community development activities that include collaborative partnerships with undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, student involvement in research, and a significant base of public visitors. The Awardee will be responsible to plan an integrated and dynamic program of research and education that is based in and builds evidence about learning in the context of frontier science, and that incorporates citizen science.  The program should build on NOAO's programmatic and scientific strengths and on its local context to advance NSF strategic goals, and should be an exemplar of innovative and cutting-edge approaches to education and community involvement that draw on the unique scientific assets of the facility. </p>
          <p>Other areas proposers should consider:</p>
          <p>a.  Partnerships.  As appropriate, the Awardee may develop partnerships, collaborations, or arrangements with universities/colleges, national laboratories, research museums, private sector research laboratories and observatories, state and local government laboratories, and international collaborations that would enable NOAO to attain or exceed its strategic goals. Partner institutions may work collaboratively with the Awardee and NSF to ensure that non-NSF programs managed by the Awardee are consistent with the NOAO mission and are subject to prior approval by NSF.  Partnership agreements that dedicate blocks of user time in exchange for financial or personnel contributions to NOAO must be consistent with the NOAO mission and justified in their overall benefit to the NOAO user community and the broader scientific research community and must be approved by NSF. </p>
          <p>b.  Open Skies.  U.S. national telescope facilities are open to all astronomers regardless of institutional or national affiliation. Observing time is available on a competitive basis to qualified scientists after evaluation of research proposals on the basis of scientific merit, the capability of the instruments to do the work, and the availability of the telescope during the requested time. Proposers are cautioned about partnership agreements that may conflict with Open Skies provisions.  During the course of this award, it is possible that the open skies or &quot;open access&quot; practices may be changed, upon instruction from the NSF.</p>

The visits are expected to take place in September 2013, and will be guided and managed by NSF staff. The visits are voluntary for proposers, but they will be an opportunity for potential proposers to view the facilities and to acquire information relevant to the development of a proposal. Attendees will be responsible for their own expenses. Additional detail about the site visits, such as dates, times, locations, number of participants, may be obtained from the Cognizant Program Officer. </p>

          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
     
          <p>Estimated program budget and award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds. </p>
          <p>The successful proposal will be awarded as a cooperative agreement with an expected ten year duration. The initial award commitment will be for five years with continuation for an additional five years contingent on a successful performance review in the fourth year.  NSF funding for NOAO baseline operations and management is anticipated at an initial level of $17,500,000 in FY 2016 with a projected escalation by 3% each year for the duration of the award.  The escalation factor was derived from consideration of projections for U.S. inflation and including the complexities of planning operating costs in Chile with Chilean inflation, legal requirements for employee salary increases, and currency conversion. The escalation is intended to maintain a constant level of effort; it is not intended to accommodate any changes in scope. </p>
          <p>The budgets for each year derived from the escalation formula are for planning purposes only. Actual annual funding increments will be determined on the basis of annual program operating plans submitted by the Awardee to NSF and approved by NSF, subject to the availability of appropriated funds and to the performance of both the Awardee and NOAO. </p>
          <p>As described in the Program Description of the solicitation, NSF anticipates that it may be necessary to continue NSF funding for Mayall telescope operations through FY 2016 and possibly FY 2017 in order to facilitate a smooth transition to a new funding source.  In this event, NSF will add supplementary funds to the Kitt Peak operations budget in 2016 and possibly 2017 that are targeted specifically to continue Mayall operations at a constant level of effort and to bridge the Mayall from NSF support to a new source of operating funds.  If these funds are necessary, they will be an addition to the baseline O&amp;M funding for NOAO.</p>
          <p>If a new awardee is selected to replace the incumbent, NSF will fund appropriate transition costs through a cooperative support agreement with the new awardee for a transition period of up to four months preceding the main cooperative agreement. Relevant transition activities include interviewing and hiring personnel, assigning subcontracts, transferring data and property, and obtaining permits and licenses. During this transition period, the new awardee will have appropriate access to NOAO personnel and facilities. </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

        <p>For Full Proposals, reviewers will be asked to identify and analyze the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strengths and weaknesses of the proposed management approach; </li>
          <li>Strengths and weaknesses of the proposed budgeting and financial plans;</li>
          <li>Opportunities and potential benefits that the proposed approach presents for NOAO;</li>
          <li>Risks to the future success of NOAO in the proposer's approach that are not satisfactorily addressed;</li>
          <li>Cost reasonableness and cost efficiency of the proposed approach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the process of formulating an overall assessment of the viability of the proposer's management and operations plan for NOAO, reviewers will consider each of the areas below. </p>
        <p>1. Management: overall management and financial plans</p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>

          <li>the role of the managing organization in relation to NOAO, NSF and the stakeholders; </li>
          <li>the relevance of proposed methods to support and reinforce the NOAO mission and programmatic scope with primary stakeholders;</li>
          <li>the extent and quality of the plan to engage the  multidisciplinary and multi-user community served by NOAO, with clear lines of communication, understanding of community needs and issues, and the means to engage the community in planning, research, education and development of relevant instruments and technology;</li>
          <li>the suitability, credibility and risks of proposed partnerships and their added value to NOAO and to NSF-supported science, education and outreach;</li>
          <li>the applicability of proposed methodologies for identifying, estimating and prioritizing future requirements, including demonstrated awareness of potential directions of the relevant sciences and responsiveness to stated community needs and ambitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Operations, maintenance, environmental, safety, health, and security</p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the feasibility, relevance to NOAO stakeholders, and potential for success of the proposed approach, including organizational structure, resource integration, provision of space and equipment, logistics support for scientific initiatives, data management and information technology, and maintenance, safety and security of systems and facilities;</li>
          <li>the sufficiency, and potential for achieving effective results, of the proposed methodology for assessing and improving NOAO performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Budgeting, staffing, and workforce management</p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the adequacy of the proposed methods and processes for managing the budget of a complex organization;</li>
          <li>the adequacy and appropriateness of the organization's named personnel and proposed labor categories for fulfilling the NOAO mission;</li>
          <li>the suitability and potential for success of the proposed methods for recruitment and retention, promoting diversity at all levels in the organization, invigorating and training the workforce, and infusing new ideas and approaches in NOAO programs and administration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. Science and facility planning </p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the ability to respond to and prioritize evolving scientific and engineering needs and opportunities in the community, particularly in response to changing budgetary environments; </li>
          <li>the degree to which the proposed programs, priorities and technical capabilities reflect the needs of NOAO stakeholder communities and utilize the unique research capabilities provided and facilitated by NOAO; the scope, feasibility and innovation of the planned activities;</li>
          <li>the extent to which planning targets critical goals relevant to the NOAO strategic vision, identifies challenging scientific and technical questions or barriers to be overcome, identifies performance measures for the planning and delivery process, and reflects appropriate and effective use of resources where possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5. Education, public outreach, and open access </p>
        <p>With due consideration of the funding limitations, reviewers will consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the extent and quality of the proposed education and outreach programs, their potential for success, and the resulting impacts on identified target audiences;</li>
          <li>the relevance of the proposed plan to engage and develop intellectual talent, including groups underrepresented in the sciences, mathematics and engineering, in the conduct of NOAO research, education and operational support activities;</li>
          <li>the suitability of proposed mechanisms to ensure broad and equitable access to NOAO among the relevant scientific research communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>6. Transition Plan: The Transition Plan will be evaluated to assess the proposing organization's ability to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of NOAO upon completion of the transition period without degradation of high-quality services, research efforts and facilities.</p>
        <p>In addition, NSF will assess the organization's budgetary and financial information as requested as part of the merit review and as outlined under Section V.B of this solicitation. The organization will be assessed for the adequacy of its internal accounting and operational controls (including human resources, property control and procurement systems), potential for attracting qualified employees, and the adequacy of its financial resources for managing NOAO. The proposed fee (if any) and proposed total costs will be evaluated by NSF for reasonableness and potential impact on funding available for science and related activities. The impact of total costs and any proposed fee will be evaluated relative to other organizations' proposed total costs and fees. The business evaluation will be used to help inform the Program Officer's recommendation for award. </p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>Proposals will be reviewed with a combination of ad hoc reviews, panel review meetings, and reverse site visits.  The panel review will have access to the ad hoc reviews, and with its own deliberations will formulate an overall evaluation of each proposal.  The panel membership will include experts in business practices and management of scientific organizations. </p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.  The proposal submitted in response to this solicitation that is recommended for award also must be approved by the National Science Board, and that may require additional processing time.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>The managing organization will be required to provide planning documents such as annual program plans and long-range plans, for all programs at NOAO, along with reports as may be required by NSF. Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), NSF is required to report on the Federal Performance Goals for Facilities. Any and all facilities with an annual budget exceeding a specific threshold must report on their operations activities; and any and all construction/upgrade projects that exceed a total project cost of a specific threshold must report on their construction/upgrade activities. Therefore, the awardee will be required, upon request of the cognizant NSF program officer, to submit annual reports related to the GPRA performance goals. This may include the collection and submission of specific data related to the NSF GPRA <a id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1" href="/#_msocom_1" title="_msoanchor_1"></a>requirements.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism.

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
