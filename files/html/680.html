<li>
<p><a name="imiet" id="imiet"></a><strong>Is my institution eligible to  submit proposals to the PIRE competition?</strong> <br />
The submitting &nbsp;institution must be a university that has  granted at least one Ph. D. in a science or engineering field since January 1,  2006, be accredited in, and have a campus located in the U.S.&nbsp; In almost all cases the data from<br /> 
<em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/pire-2006-se-docs-by-inst.xls">The Survey of  Earned Doctorates, 2006</a> </em>table which is listed on the PIRE webpagewill be used to determine eligibility.  Institutions that have awarded such degrees since 2006 but are not included in  the <em>Survey</em> list as having done so should  read the next question for more information regarding eligibility.</span><a name="miini" id="miini"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My  institution is not included in <em>The Survey  of Earned Doctorates, 2006</em> list that is posted on the PIRE webpage, but we  have many Ph.D. students conducting research here. Is my institution eligible  to apply?<br />
</strong>If your university is  included in the <em>The Survey of Earned  Doctorates, 2006 </em>tablethatislisted on the PIRE webpage<em>,</em> it is  eligible to submit proposals to PIRE. If not, you must contact PIRE program  staff before submission and provide evidence demonstrating the eligibility of  your university entity. </span><a name="wcbap" id="wcbap"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who can be a PI or Co-PI? <br />
</strong>To  be listed as the PI on a PIRE proposal, an individual must beaffiliated with the U.S.-based,  Ph.D.-granting university that submits the proposal (i.e., the lead  institution).&nbsp; Co-PIs will be associated  with the lead institution or with U.S.-based organizations collaborating with  the lead institution.&nbsp; </span><a name="iaiit" id="iaiit"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If an institution is the  submitting institution on three preliminary proposals, is it also able to  participate in other proposals through subawards, assuming all the  investigators are different (so that the limit on individual PI participation  is not an issue)?</strong> <br />
The &quot;three per institution&quot; limit on preliminary  proposal submissions applies only to those preliminary proposals on which the  institution is the submitting or lead institution. Your institution may be a  non-lead partner on proposals over and above those three lead proposals,  assuming no&nbsp;PI, Co-PI or other Senior Personnel is involved in more than  one proposal.</span><a name="dtpht" id="dtpht"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does the PI have to be a U.S. citizen?<br />
</strong>
U.S. citizenship</span>of the  PI and other researchers on the U.S.  team is not required. <a name="ccioc" id="ccioc"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can collaborators in other countries  be PIs, Co-PIs or other Senior Personnel on my proposal?</strong><br />
No, international collaborators should be  listed as Foreign Collaborators.</span><a name="ohmpc" id="ohmpc"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On how many proposals can I  serve as a PI or co-PI or other Senior Personnel?<br />
</strong>One may participate as  PI, co-PI, or other Senior Personnel (including on subawards and as  consultants) on no more than one preliminary proposal and one full proposal  submission.</span><a name="iwaan" id="iwaan"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I work at a non-Ph.D. granting  institution. Is there a way I can participate in the PIRE program?</strong><br />
Individuals  who are affiliated with a non-Ph.D.-granting institution are encouraged to work  with their colleagues at Ph.D.-granting institutions in developing PIRE  projects; such individuals may participate in PIRE projects, as Co-PIs or  Senior Personnel, with their students being supported for research-related  activities, and with their own institutions serving as collaborating  organizations on the PIRE project. </span><a name="iaaal" id="iaaal"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am at a large university and I have a collaborator at a four-year  college. Can I include her and her students in my PIRE project?<br />
</strong>Yes. PIRE  PIs are encouraged to take advantage of their research and education networks  to bring faculty and students from a diverse range of institutions into their  PIRE projects.</span><a name="iaajf" id="iaajf"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am a junior faculty. Am I eligible to be the PI?  Have any untenured professors been PIs on PIRE awards? Is there anything you  would recommend for a junior PI?<br />
</strong></span>Yes, you are eligible to be a PI. Yes, several  untenured faculty members have been PIs on PIRE awards. For any PI, whether  junior faculty or not, one key to success will be to put together a team of PI,  Co-PI(s), other Senior Personnel, international collaborators, administrative  staff, and/or advisory committee members, that provides the project not only  the necessary scientific/engineering and educational expertise, but also the  essential managerial and logistical expertise to be able to coordinate and  integrate all of the pieces of a large international research and education  project.<a name="italo" id="italo"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is there a limit on the number  of full proposals that will be invited from any one institution? On the number  of awards per institution?<br />
</strong>No, there is no limit. We seek to invite, and  fund, those proposals that offer the best opportunity to advance all PIRE  objectives. That being said, portfolio balance will be a consideration in the  invitation and award process.</span><a name="ccpai" id="ccpai"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can current PIRE awardee  institutions receive new awards in the current competition?<br />
</strong>Yes. Those  institutions that have received PIRE awards in the past are eligible to receive  awards in this competition. PIs submitting proposals from such institutions  should be in contact with current PIRE awardees at their institution to discuss  how their projects might have complementary institutional impacts.</span><a name="cisac" id="cisac"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can I submit a collaborative proposal  from multiple organizations for the project I am developing with my colleague  from another U.S.  institution (and with our foreign colleagues)?<br />
</strong>PIRE will accept only one  proposal per project; the proposal for your collaborative partnership should be  submitted as a single proposal in which a single award is requested by the lead  university. The lead university may make subawards to collaborating U.S.  institutions as appropriate. </span></p>

<p><strong class="greybold">PROGRAM DETAILS</strong><br />
<img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="blue line" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/> <br />
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>
<p><strong><a name="hmpps" id="hmpps"></a>How many preliminary proposal  submissions are expected?<br />
</strong>Based on past competitions and newly expanded  eligibility, we expect to receive 550-650 preliminary proposals.</span><a name="hmfpd" id="hmfpd"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many full proposals do you  expect to invite?<br />
</strong>We expect to invite 50-70 PIs to submit full proposals.</span><a name="atomo" id="atomo"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A total of $40 million over five  years for the PIRE program is not a lot of money. How many awards do you expect  to make?<br />
</strong>We estimate that we will fund between 5 and 20 awards, depending  on the budgets of the most highly ranked proposals. The amount of $40 million  represents only funds from NSF&rsquo;s Office of International Science and  Engineering (OISE). Co-funding, which will be sought from other NSF  directorates and offices, would increase the total funding available. </span><a name="waora" id="waora"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What areas of research are  appropriate?<br />
</strong>Proposals</span>may be submitted in any NSF-supported  field of science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM), as well as for  research on STEM education. Please visit NSF&rsquo;s online Guide to Programs for  more information on the fields that NSF supports: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/browse_all_funding.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/browse_all_funding.jsp</a>.  Please see the next question regarding research in medical or health-related  areas.<a name="iiaii" id="iiaii"></a></p>
</li>
<li><strong>If I am interested in conducting  collaborative international research on a health-related or medical topic,  should I apply to PIRE?<br />
</strong>NSF&rsquo;s <em>Proposal  and Award Policies and Procedures Guide</em><br />
 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/nsf091.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/nsf091.pdf</a> ) states that</span>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Research with  disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment  of physical or mental disease, abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or  animals, is normally not supported. Animal models of such conditions or the  development or testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also  are not eligible for support. However, research in bioengineering, with  diagnosis- or treatment-related goals, that applies engineering principles to  problems in biology and medicine while advancing engineering knowledge is  eligible for support.&rdquo; <a name="tptiw" id="tptiw"></a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The project that I want to  propose requires that I bring together scientists and engineers from several  disciplines. Is such research appropriate for PIRE?<br />
</strong>Yes. PIRE welcomes  proposals that cut across disciplinary boundaries, as well as proposals within  a single discipline, as long as in each case the objectives of the PIRE program  are met.</span><a name="wimif" id="wimif"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Which is more important for PIRE,  research or education?<br />
</strong>Both are equally important. Both need to be  addressed in an integrated manner, along with all other PIRE objectives.</span><a name="iawap" id="iawap"></a></p>
</li>
<li><strong>I am writing a proposal for my  regular non-OISE NSF program and I have a foreign collaborator(s) that I can  add. Should I submit it to PIRE instead?<br />
</strong>The PIRE competition is not  intended to fund projects that can be funded by other programs at NSF; every  year NSF disciplinary programs fund the large majority of research projects  that involve international collaborators, such as the one that you describe.  Successful PIRE projects will be different in nature and scope from such  proposals because: </span> </li>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the international collaboration  is at the core of the project, drives the project, and is essential to its  success; </li>
<li>there is a specific focus on significantly  engaging U.S.  students and early-career researchers in the international research  collaborations at foreign sites; and</li>
<li>the PIRE project must address  how it will contribute to institutional changes above the level of the PI&rsquo;s  research program that will strengthen the ability of U.S. students and  researchers to undertake international collaboration. <a name="iauat" id="iauat"></a></li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I am uncertain about the  institutional part of PIRE.&nbsp; I am  interested in putting together a project that involves researchers at multiple U.S.  and foreign institutions.&nbsp; Can I apply to  PIRE?<br />
</strong>Yes. PIRE seeks to support proposals that link people and  institutions together in the manner most appropriate for their PIRE objectives &ndash;  including, but not limited to projects that link two or a few institutions, that  link many groups in a consortia, and that link many researchers in a network. Most  current PIRE projects involve researchers at multiple U.S.  institutions.&nbsp; Many also involve  researchers in more than one foreign country, often at multiple institutions within  a country (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819&amp;org=OISE&amp;from=home">PIRE  homepage</a> for abstracts and/or webpages for many existing PIRE projects). The  key is to find those collaborators who can most contribute to strengthening  your project in an integrated and coordinated way.</span><a name="itaon" id="itaon"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is there an optimal number of  partner institutions or partner countries in a PIRE?<br />
</strong>This will vary with the project. The  existing PIRE projects vary widely in the number of partners and countries  involved (see 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819&amp;org=OISE&amp;from=home">PIRE  homepage</a> for webpages and abstracts for many existing PIRE projects). PIs  are advised to put together teams that work best for the project they propose,  keeping in mind NSF&rsquo;s interest in funding focused research projects (rather  than collections of loosely-related activities) that include well-integrated  education programs and strong management plans. </span><a name="hcpfi" id="hcpfi"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How can partners from industry  be included in my project?<br />
</strong></span>Partnerships with industry participation are  welcome in the PIRE program. Such interactions can take many forms (e.g.,  industry can provide internship opportunities for students, provide access to  research equipment, participate as full research partners, or assist with  technology transfer). PIRE funds should not be used to cover the expenses of  industrial partners in the project, but can be used to support non-industrial  personnel (e.g., U.S.  faculty and students) to work with the industrial partner. PIs are strongly  encouraged to develop Intellectual Property Rights agreements, particularly  with foreign entities, either before the start of the project or very early in  the life of the project.</span><a name="ciiim" id="ciiim"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can I include in my PIRE  partnership a colleague who works at a U.S. government agency or lab?<br />
</strong>Yes,  collaborations with colleagues from U.S. government agencies and labs  are welcome. However, there are strict rules governing the use of NSF funds in  such collaborations. Please consult<br /> 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/nsf091.pdf">NSF&rsquo;s Proposal  and Award Policies and Procedures Guide</a>, Ch 1.E.7, for more information.</span><a name="dmunt" id="dmunt"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does my university need to enter  into a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with our foreign counterparts for the  PIRE to be successful? Will my proposal be strengthened by having an MOU?<br />
</strong>The  nature of many projects may not require any formal agreements between  institutions. In other cases, an MOU may be very important to achieving the  PIRE project&rsquo;s objectives. You should do what makes the most sense for the type  of project you want to propose.</span><a name="miida" id="miida"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My institution is developing an  MOU with a foreign institution and a number of faculty in several departments  want to collaborate with scientists in the corresponding departments overseas.  Should we apply for a PIRE?<br />
</strong>One of PIRE&rsquo;s objectives is to support collaborative  research on a question in a focused, well-integrated project. If the set of  faculty you describe can do this, PIRE might be an appropriate place to seek  funding. If, on the other hand, you are seeking funding to support many  different, unrelated collaborations between the two institutions, your proposal  is unlikely to be successful in the PIRE competition.</span><a name="wdymw" id="wdymw"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What do you mean when you say to  describe the international landscape at my &ldquo;institution&rdquo;? What should be  included?<br />
</strong>First, identify the &ldquo;institution&rdquo; that you  seek to impact with a PIRE award &ndash; your university, school, department or  perhaps a subset of the community of researchers in your field.&nbsp; Then briefly describe the current state of  internationalization within your field and institution &ndash; e.g., the extent to  which your field is internationalized, the distribution of expertise,  equipment, geographically-based phenomena and data around the world, and  countries that are leaders in your field or a part of your field and whose  collaboration is essential. Then describe the challenges that limit  international engagement for U.S.  students, faculty and institutions in your field (e.g., curriculum constraints,  visa problems, language and cultural barriers, IPR issues, teaching  constraints, professional or institutional disincentives, tenure and promotion or  other institutional policy considerations). Finally, describe how a PIRE award  would help overcome these challenges and enhance international engagement.</span><a name="wkotm" id="wkotm"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What kind of things might my  university consider in choosing the three preliminary proposals to submit?<br />
</strong>NSF  expects institutions to select proposals that will strengthen international  engagement beyond the level of the PI&rsquo;s research group, promote optimal use of  institutional resources and capabilities, and align with long-term strategic  international goals of the institution(s). Universities are encouraged to  interpret the &ldquo;institutional&rdquo; framework broadly; many current PIRE awards  involve multiple U.S.  and foreign institutions, enabling the lead institution to become the hub of a  vibrant international network. The PIRE program encourages the submission of a  wide range of proposals in terms of diversity of participating individuals and  institutions, fields of study, scope, budget, and model of institutional  engagement.</span><a name="hwrpb" id="hwrpb"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How will renewal proposals be  handled relative to new proposals?<br />
</strong>Renewal proposals will count as one of  the three preliminary proposal submissions from each institution. PIs of  renewal proposals must explicitly describe in their proposals the significant  achievements of the prior PIRE award and the added value of the proposed effort  beyond that of the previous award. In all other respects, renewal proposals  will be reviewed in the same manner as new proposals.</span><a name="iunhr" id="iunhr"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I understand NSF has recently  signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work with the U.S. Agency for  International Development. What could this mean for my PIRE proposal or  project?<br />
</strong>NSF and USAID are working to develop mechanisms to support  projects that meet the objectives of both agencies, wherein NSF would fund U.S. side costs  and USAID would support related project costs in relevant developing countries.  At the time the PIRE program solicitation was published, no formal mechanism for  USAID to participate in the PIRE program competition had been approved. </span></p>

<p><strong class="greybold">PRELIMINARY PROPOSALS</strong><br />
<img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="blue line" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/> <br />
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>
<p><strong><a name="iaffb" id="iaffb"></a>Is a full FastLane budget  required for a preliminary proposal?<br />
</strong>No, a preliminary budget and budget  justification of no more than two pages is required for a preliminary proposal.  The preliminary budget information should be entered as part of the Project Description.  DO NOT enter the information into the FastLane budget module. Enter $2 in the  Requested Amount box on the FastLane cover sheet. </span><a name="alocr" id="alocr"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are letters of commitment  required for preliminary proposals?<br />
</strong>No. At the preliminary proposal stage,  letters of commitment from the submitting institution or collaborating  institutions should not be included. </span><a name="iopii" id="iopii"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If our proposal is invited into  the full proposal stage of the competition, can the project team or scope of  the project be changed from what was in the preliminary proposal?<br />
</strong>Any  changes in the research team and any major changes in the scope of the original  project as presented in the preliminary proposal must be approved by PIRE staff  in writing before submission of a full proposal</span><a name="dints" id="dints"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I need to submit a conceptual  data management policy in my preliminary proposals?<br />
</strong>No, this will only be  required for the full proposals. In the notification inviting PIs to submit  full proposals, more information about which units at NSF have data management  policies, and links to those policies, will be provided. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong class="greybold">FULL PROPOSALS</strong><br />
<img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="blue line" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/> <br />
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li>
<p><strong><a name="dintb" id="dintb"></a>Do I need to be invited to  submit a full proposal&mdash;i.e., can I submit one anyway, even if I am not invited?<br />
</strong>The decision to Invite or Not Invite full  proposal submission is binding. Full proposal submissions that are not invited  by NSF will be returned without review. </span><a name="hwiki" id="hwiki"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How will I know if I am invited  to submit a full proposal?<br />
</strong>Upon completion of the preliminary proposal  review process, OISE will electronically  notify approximately 50-70 PIs and their organization&rsquo;s Sponsored Projects  Office (SPO) of the &ldquo;Invited to Submit Full Proposal&rdquo; decision.&nbsp;OISE will also electronically notify PIs and their  organization&rsquo;s SPO for proposals that are &ldquo;Not Invited&rdquo; to submit full  proposals.</span><a name="wsstl" id="wsstl"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who should sign the letter of commitment  from my institution and my collaborators&rsquo; institutions? Department Chair? Dean?  Vice President for Research? Provost?<br />
</strong>It  depends on the institutional impact that the project aims to achieve&mdash;and whose  commitment within the institution will be key to achieving the project&rsquo;s  institutional impact objectives. If the PIRE team expects an award to have a  transformative impact of the PI&rsquo;s department, then a letter from the Department  Chair would be essential. For projects that aim to advance a university-wide  effort to strengthen international research engagement, support at the Vice  President for Research or Provost level would likely be more appropriate. For  projects that bring together researchers and students from multiple U.S.  institutions, the several Department Chairs or Deans and/or the Heads of the  relevant professional societies may be most appropriate.</span><a name="aagtg" id="aagtg"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a group, the graduate  students and faculty in my department and discipline are not very diverse. How  do I go about engaging and recruiting colleagues and students from groups  under-represented in science?<br />
</strong>Full proposals must describe strategies and  provisions for creating a diverse team of U.S. researchers and students. Therefore  PIs are encouraged to tap expertise on broadening participation that may be resident  on their own campuses (e.g., PIs of NSF-sponsored programs to enhance diversity  such as AGEP, CREST, ADVANCE, LSAMP, HBCU-UP, TCUP, all described on NSF&rsquo;s <br />
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=HRD">Division of Human Resource  Development (HRD</a>) homepage). PIs are encouraged to build collaborations  with faculty at Minority-Serving Institutions &ndash; thereby establishing strong  research and educational relationships which can enhance a more sustainable recruitment  strategy. PIs are also encouraged to work with their STEM professional  societies, many of which have active programs for enhancing diversity at both  the faculty and student levels, as well as with professional societies  specifically targeting groups underrepresented in science (e.g., the American  Society of Black Physicists, the Society for the Advancement of Chicano and  Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), the Society of Women Engineers).</span><a name="cypeo" id="cypeo"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can you provide examples of the  types of mentoring activities that I should provide a postdoctoral researcher  (and that I must include in my full proposal)?<br />
</strong>As per the 2009 NSF <em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/gpg_index.jsp">
Grant  Proposal Guide</a>,</em> which will take effect on January 5, 2009, if a project  has any support for a postdoctoral researcher, it must include, as a separate  section within the 20-page Project Description, a description of the mentoring  activities. Examples of mentoring activities include, but are not limited to:  career counseling; training in preparation of grant proposals, publications and  presentations; guidance on ways to improve teaching and mentoring skills;  guidance on how to effectively collaborate with researchers from diverse  backgrounds and disciplinary areas; and training in responsible professional  practices. Proposals that do not include a separate section on mentoring  activities for the postdoctoral researcher(s) in the Project Description of a  full proposal will be <strong>returned without  review</strong>! </span><a name="idhme" id="idhme"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t have much experience in  evaluating the impact of my scientific projects. How can I put together a  strong evaluation and assessment plan?<br />
</strong>PIRE requires a strong assessment  plan, so successful projects will need specific expertise to be able to develop  effective techniques, tools and metrics for project evaluation. PIs are  encouraged to tap the evaluation and assessment expertise that is often  resident on their campuses or on the campuses of their U.S. partners. Effective  strategies used in the current PIRE projects include working with faculty and  graduate students in a Department of Education, working with faculty and  students in a Social Science department interested in international research  and education, working with evaluation professionals supported by the  university, and/or hiring outside experts to assist in evaluation activities. &nbsp;</span><a name="hwfpb" id="hwfpb"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow will full proposals be  reviewed?<br />
</strong>Full proposals will undergo both <em>ad hoc</em> and panel review.  The <em>ad hoc</em> review will evaluate each proposal based on the standard  NSF review criteria and the PIRE-specific review criteria from the perspective  of experts in the relevant field(s) of research.&nbsp;The full proposal panel  review will use the same criteria to evaluate the proposals&rsquo; ability to achieve  the multiple objectives of the program, relative to other proposals.</span><a name="wsiua" id="wsiua"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What should I use as the start  date for my PIRE project?<br />
</strong>You may list a starting date as early as November  1, 2009 and as late as September 30, 2010. You should request a starting date  that best fits your project&rsquo;s timetable.</span></p>

<ol start="44" type="1">
<li>
<p><a name="witma" id="witma"></a><strong>What is the maximum award size  for a PIRE project?<br />
</strong>There is no maximum award in the FY09 PIRE  competition. PIs are invited to request the budget they believe they need to  implement their integrated research and education program. </span><a name="wdnrt" id="wdnrt"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why did NSF remove the budget  cap on PIRE proposals?<br />
</strong>In previous  PIRE competitions most proposals had budgets very close to the upper limit,  suggesting that the budget cap may have constrained institutions and PIs in a  variety of ways. Some PIs may have cut out aspects of their projects that would  have been beneficial but could not be included because of the budget limitation.  For projects that required less than the budget cap, PIs may have faced a perceived  incentive to include additional elements to bring the budget up to the limit.  The intent of removing the budget cap is to encourage submission of proposals  of diverse scale and scope, with a wider range of budgets, both large and  small, that are more closely tailored to the needs of the proposed partnership project. </span><a name="cpfbu" id="cpfbu"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can PIRE funds be used to  support the salary or travel-related expenses of foreign participants?<br />
</strong>NSF  funds are intended to support the U.S. side of a research and  education collaboration; the international collaborators should seek funding  for their participation in the project from their own funding sources. NSF&rsquo;s  expectation is that the opportunity to participate in a high-profile,  large-scale, multi-year cutting-edge science or engineering research project  will provide strong inducement to foreign counterparts, and their funding  agencies, to participate in the project without NSF support of their  participation. For projects involving exchanges of researchers and/or students,  please see the next question. In PIRE projects where collaborators are  scientists and engineers from a developing country or from a country whose  currency&nbsp;is not convertible, limited funds may be requested to support  their participation in the project; proposers should consult with the OISE  program officer(s) responsible for the country(ies) in question (listed at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp" title="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp</a>)  before submitting a detailed full-proposal budget.</span><a name="cipsc" id="cipsc"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can I pay some costs for my  foreign partner&rsquo;s researchers or students in the U.S. if they do the same for my  research team members when they are overseas?<br />
</strong>For projects involving  exchanges of researchers and/or students, reciprocal arrangements for provision  of housing and subsistence are allowed and are encouraged, with adherence to  the overall principle that each side supports equivalent costs.&nbsp;</span><a name="cpfss" id="cpfss"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can PIRE funding support  students at U.S. institutions  who are not U.S.  citizens or permanent residents?<br />
</strong>In exceptional cases, PIRE</span>funding  can support students enrolled in degree programs at U.S.  institutions who are not U.S.  citizens or permanent residents, but highest priority should be given to students  who are U.S.  citizens or permanent residents.<a name="dtpaf" id="dtpaf"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does the program allow funding  for travel and subsistence expenses for students and post-docs?<br />
</strong>Yes. In fact, the solicitation states  that &ldquo;It is the expectation that a significant portion of a PIRE award&rsquo;s direct  costs will fund&nbsp;undergraduate students, graduate students, and/or early  career researchers who are U.S.  citizens or permanent residents to conduct collaborative research-related  activities at foreign sites.&rdquo; For more details, please consult the program  solicitation section on Budget and Allowable Costs for full proposals.</span><a name="mipia" id="mipia"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My institution participates in a  large Study Abroad program in the country where my PIRE will be working. Can I  include the cost of Study Abroad programs for undergraduate students in my  budget?<br />
</strong>Inclusion of such Study Abroad costs would only be considered if  the proposal demonstrates that the activity provides an essential and integral  part of the students&rsquo; international research experience.</span><a name="ibiie" id="ibiie"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I believe it is essential that  my PIRE students have at least a basic understanding of the language of the  country in which they will be conducting research. Can I use PIRE funds to  support language training for my students in the U.S. and/or while they are abroad?<br />
</strong>Inclusion of language training costs would be considered if the proposal demonstrates  that the language training activity would be an essential and integral part of  the students&rsquo; international research experience. </span><a name="hmfcb" id="hmfcb"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much funding can be used for  salary support of the PI, co-PI, or other senior project personnel?<br />
</strong>The  solicitation allows salary support for the PI for up to a maximum of two months  per year.&nbsp; For co-PIs or other Senior Personnel  salary support (including as consultants and in subawards), the maximum level  per individual is one month per year. </span><a name="italt" id="italt"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is there a limit to how much  travel can be included in the budget?<br />
</strong>No. PIs are encouraged to request the  level of travel that is necessary to achieve optimal results in the integrated  research and education program. The expectation is that undergraduate and  graduate students and early career researchers will have extensive  opportunities for significant participation in overseas research experiences  under the proposed project. </span><a name="ctpgs" id="ctpgs"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can the PIRE grant support  sabbatical leave for a PI or co-PI?<br />
</strong>PIRE is not intended as a sabbatical  support program. PIRE salary support for the PI is limited to two months per year  and salary for co-PI(s) and Senior Personnel (including as consultants and in  subawards) is limited to one month per year.</span><a name="mwrts" id="mwrts"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Must we request the same level  of budget for each year?<br />
</strong>No. You are  encouraged to request the budget that makes sense for your project. Expanding  the program in stages may make sense in many cases.</span><a name="cwuso" id="cwuso"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can we use some of the budget to  support project coordination? Must a project coordinator be a Co-PI?<br />
</strong>For  some of the current PIRE projects, strong coordination has been a key contributor  to early success. &nbsp;So yes, part of the PIRE  budget may be used to support project coordination, (e.g., part-time salary for  a coordinator, coordination meetings, support for an outside advisory committee)  on a scale commensurate with the complexity of the partnership. The project  coordinator does not have to be a Co-PI. If the project coordinator is a PI,  Co-PI, or other Senior Personnel, the amount of salary that they can receive  from the PIRE award is limited to two months per year for the PI and one month  per year for Co-PI and other Senior Personnel.</span><a name="iacti" id="iacti"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am concerned that in the  review NSF might be biased against projects that partner with distant or  expensive countries, and also against projects that require more equipment or  supplies?</strong> <strong>How will such differences  be handled?<br />
</strong>NSF will work to ensure that the review process does not  introduce a bias due to different costs for travel to and/or subsistence in  different countries, nor due to differential costs of conducting research in  different disciplines. Regarding equipment costs, the &ldquo;Budget and Allowable  Costs&rdquo; section for full proposals notes that &ldquo;PIRE is not intended to support  the purchase, operation or maintenance of moderate to large equipment. Only  limited equipment costs can be included.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong><a name="iansw" id="iansw"></a>I am not sure whether my  international collaboration is ready for PIRE or whether my project will be  chosen by my university for submission. If I don&rsquo;t submit a preliminary  proposal, can I participate in the PIRE program as a panelist or reviewer?<br />
</strong>Yes, the PIRE program welcomes offers to volunteer as a panelist or reviewer.  Please send an e-mail to <br />
<a href="mailto:PIRE-info@nsf.gov">PIRE-info@nsf.gov</a> indicating your interest,  disciplinary expertise, and international experience, and attach a 2-page <em>Curriculum Vitae</em>.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When should my foreign collaborator seek  funding on his/her side?<br />
</strong>PIs are encouraged to be in contact with their  foreign counterparts as they develop their preliminary proposals. However,  because so few PIRE awards will be made relative to the number of preliminary  proposals and because the PIRE awards will not be made until November 2009 at  the earliest, it is advisable that your foreign collaborators wait at least  until a full proposal is invited before they seek parallel funding. At that  time PIs may want to discuss possible mechanisms for foreign collaborators to  seek support in their own countries with the relevant country program officers  in OISE, listed at (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp" title="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp</a>).&nbsp; </span><a name="hwrae" id="hwrae"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow will research and education programs across NSF be involved in  PIRE?<br />
</strong>Research and education  programs across NSF are participating fully in PIRE planning and review. Review  panels will be jointly moderated by program officers from OISE  and from the other directorates/offices. Co-funding of awards will also be  sought from relevant NSF programs.</span><a name="wsisa" id="wsisa"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When should I seek approval from my university for  research involving human or vertebrate subjects?<br />
</strong></span>In general, this  process should be initiated after receiving the invitation to submit a full  proposal. However, you should check with your university&rsquo;s Institutional Review  Board (IRB) for human subject research or your university&rsquo;s Institutional  Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for animal subject research as to their  internal requirements. Note that no National Science Foundation funds can be  released for an award until all research protocol approvals have been granted  by your university.<a name="ihnuf" id="ihnuf"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have never used FastLane  before. How do I get started?<br />
</strong>If you are a new user to FastLane, you should  first consult with the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) at your  institution well in advance of the proposal deadline dates to obtain the  support you will need during the submission process. The NSF home page contains  more details about using FastLane as well as a FastLane demonstration site.</span><a name="ihnug" id="ihnug"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have never used Grants.gov  before. How do I get started?<br />
</strong>If you are a new user to Grants.gov, you  should first consult with the AOR at your institution well in advance of the  proposal deadline dates to obtain the support you will need during the  submission process. The Grants.gov website contains more details about  registering with and using Grants.gov.</span></p>
