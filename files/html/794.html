      <div class="user_input">
        <blockquote>
          <p>The HIAPER (High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for
            Environmental Research) project consists of a highly modified Gulfstream
            V (GV) aircraft capable of high altitude, long duration, large payload
            capability and high speed flight.&#160; The HIAPER aircraft is intended
            to fill an important niche in the national fleet of scientific airborne
            platforms and will readily and regularly allow higher altitude&#160;and
            longer duration science payload missions than those generally available
            to the academic research community.</p>
          <p>An integral part of the HIAPER project is development and flight
            configuration of advanced research instrumentation for the HIAPER
            aircraft. This&#160;solicitation is aimed at acquisition and development
            of&#160;innovative instrumentation, measurement and sensing systems
            and new observational approaches (e.g. using emerging technologies,
            telescience) to complement the platform&#8217;s versatility and flight
            capabilities. Such instrumentation will accommodate scientific investigations
            important to national and international studies of atmospheric sciences,
            climate, hazardous weather, and earth systems science supporting
            societal needs.&#160; In order to achieve its specified flight and
            performance characteristics, HIAPER is not a large airframe.&#160; Accordingly,
            it is desirable that its new instrumentation systems and payload
            modules necessarily be of lower volume and mass, consume less power,
            require less overt operator intervention and generally be more autonomous
            than comparable instrumentation used in current research aircraft
            platforms.&#160; Consideration of these design characteristics is
            encouraged for all airborne platforms and is consistent with National
            Research Council&#160; recognized needs (NRC - Atmospheric Sciences:
            Entering the 21st Century, NAS, 1998) for the atmospheric sciences
            community to devote increased effort to instrument development.&#160;</p>
          <p>This solicitation covers instrumentation acquisition or research
            and development of instrumentation for the HIAPER platform.&#160;&#160;It
            is&#160;a key element of the HIAPER project.&#160; Instrumentation
            acquired and developed under its funding is intended to become part
            of the community&#8217;s core of pool and shared instrumentation
            at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the NSF facility
            that maintains and operates the HIAPER aircraft on behalf of the
            atmospheric and related sciences community.</p>

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>The High Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental
          Research (HIAPER), including provision for its instrumentation and
          research equipment, will be an important addition to the national airborne
          sampling capabilities for the atmospheric and related science&#160;communities.&#160; The
          combination of altitude, range, and payload of the HIAPER platform
          are unique for a jet-powered pressurized aircraft, and will provide
          new capabilities for sampling wide regions of the Earth not previously
          regularly accessible to instrumented aircraft.&#160;</p>
        <p>The design, modification and installation of airborne research equipment
          and instrumentation is a demanding and time consuming aspect of atmospheric
          research. Newly designed, commercially purchased and experimental equipment
          packages must of necessity be evaluated for their structural integrity,
          conformity to design and installation specifications appropriate to
          the airborne platform. Several safety issues may also apply.&#160;</p>
        <p class="body">Common platform specifications for load, construction
          materials, installation power, signal conditioning needs for data acquisition
          and storage systems, together with data systems software must also
          be considered. Guidelines to be followed for the GV HIAPER aircraft
          have been issued and may be consulted in the NSF&#160;<a href="http://www.hiaper.ucar.edu/handbook">GV
          Investigator&#8217;s Handbook</a>. It is expected that investigators
          will make every effort to conform to the system specifications and
          infrastructure requirements applicable to the HIAPER aircraft, as laid
          out in the Investigators Handbook. Several of these requirements are
          specified by relevant Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulations.
          Also, additional guidelines may be required for investigator equipment
          packages that utilize components or subsystems including but not limited
          to: i) lasers, ii) RF sources, iii) cryogen use, iv) compressed gases,
          iv) toxic or combustible gases, v) pressurized vessels and systems,
          vi) batteries, viii) motors and pumps, ix) heaters, x) power distribution
          or conditioning equipment, xi) radioactive sources, xii) flammable
          or potentially noxious materials.</p>
      </div>
      <a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <div>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The overall HIAPER project consists of 4 stages:&#160; (1)
            acquisition of an airframe that meets specified performance requirements;&#160;&#160; (2)
            modification of the basic airframe to accept specialized instrumentation;&#160;&#160; (3)
            systems integration and research infrastructure, which includes data
            display and communications systems together with the necessary project
            management, and;&#160;&#160; (4) outfitting of the platform with
            a complement of research instrumentation through a combination of
            acquisition and development of investigator equipment packages. This
            solicitation is directed towards fulfilling the fourth stage of the
            HIAPER project. Investigator equipment packages funded under this&#160;solicitation
            will eventually become part of the instrumentation suite available
            to the HIAPER user community. At the conclusion of the HIAPER project
            in 2005, future funding for operations, and additional instrument
            development or modifications to the&#160;facility,&#160;may be funded
            by NSF's regular programs as well as&#160;other funding sources (e.g.
            MRI program).&#160;</p>
          <p>This solicitation is based on the outcome of a community instrumentation
            and equipment&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.hiaper.ucar.edu/02workshop">workshop</a>&#160;conducted
            in November 2002. This workshop identified a number of measurement
            areas for which new or improved instrumentation needs to be developed
            to make significant progress in a number of atmospheric science questions
            and disciplines, and for which HIAPER would be the platform of choice.
            Following the workshop, the&#160;<a href="http://www.hiaper.ucar.edu/hac.html">HIAPER
            Advisory Committee</a> (HAC) assessed areas of measurement overlap
            and instrumentation commonality for these identified science focus
            discussion areas.</p>
          <p>Science categories identified by, but not limited to, these discussions&#160;included:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Aerosols
              and Cloud Microphysics</li>
            <li class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Gas
              Phase Chemistry</li>
            <li class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Radiation,
              Clouds and Climate</li>

              Dynamics of Weather Systems</li>
            <li class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sensing
              Systems for Geosciences and Biosciences Applications</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Investigator equipment packages for these science categories are
            encouraged under this solicitation.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Categories of Investigator Equipment Packages</h4>
        <p class="body">Based on discussions at the community workshop, the HAC
          suggested a categorization of measurements by the ease of which they
          could be integrated with the HIAPER platform, as a first step in community
          ranking of desired instrumentation priorities. These instrumentation
          categories are listed below as a guide.</p>
        <p><b>STANDARD USE</b>:&#160; Measurements of &#8216;state&#8217; parameters
          that are likely to be called for on most missions and that do not require
          extensive modification or R&amp;D efforts to implement. Following their
          acquisition, these investigator equipment packages would be maintained
          and operated on behalf of the community by NCAR/RAF and ATD staff,
          who would also be directly responsible for data quality, recording,
          and distribution
          to investigators. <i>The expected level of performance risk (project
          outcome uncertainty) associated with such instrumentation is expected
          to be low.</i>
        </p>
        <p><b>ROUTINE OPERATIONAL:&#160;</b> Existing, proven or attainable technologies
          that could be readily adapted to HIAPER (e.g., by miniaturization,
          repackaging, engineering) following a relatively short R&amp;D effort
          (e.g., 1-2 years) after which the technology could be transitioned
          to NCAR - ATD for maintenance and operation as &#8220;Standard&#8221; instrumentation.&#160; While
          in the development phase (before being declared a &#8220;Standard&#8221; instrument),
          deployment of this category of instrumentation may require additional
          support personnel and funds, and possibly some specialized expertise
          to commission, analyze and interpret the data streams. These investigator
          equipment packages need not fly on every HIAPER mission but would be
          available to community users upon request, could be operated and maintained
          by trained NCAR/ATD staff, with likely some level of involvement of
          the originating Principal Investigator (PIs). <i>The expected level
          of performance risk (project outcome uncertainty) associated with such
          instrumentation is expected to be low to moderate.</i></p>
        <p><b>RESEARCH</b>:&#160;&#160; Developing technologies that require
          a continued R&amp;D effort&#160; (i.e., they are primarily "PI-driven" and
          push the innovation envelope) yet are likely to fulfill community research
          needs. Such instrumentation, requiring extensive PI involvement in
          development and evaluation will likely not be ready to be turned over
          to NCAR - ATD for routine operations for several years after the initiation
          of instrument development.&#160; While under development, these investigator
          equipment packages would likely require continued involvement of a
          PI or research group for a particular mission deployment and during
          data interpretation and analysis. <i>The expected level of performance
          risk (project outcome uncertainty) associated with such instrumentation
          is expected to be moderate to high.</i></p>
        <h4>Geometries of Investigator Equipment Packages</h4>
        <p class="body">Based the community workshop discussions, the HAC further
          suggested an instrumentation categorization according to the engineering
          geometries which could be physically integrated on board the HIAPER
          platform. The instrumentation geometries suggested by the HAC are listed
          below as a guide.</p>
        <p class="body"><b>EQUIPMENT RACK MOUNTING</b>: For standard rack mountable
          instrumentation and subsystems, design attention should be paid to
          rack weight, size, power, cooling, data system connectivity, gas/hydraulic
          (inlet/exhaust) connectivity etc requirements. <i>The expected level
          of aeronautical engineering input associated with such instrumentation
          is expected to be low</i>.</p>
        <p><b>CABIN INTERIOR ATTACHMENT:</b> For non-standard equipment rack
          mounts or specialized instrumentation with non-standard footprints
          or placements, additional attention may be required to consider structural
          stress analyses and load restrictions. <i>The expected level of aeronautical
          engineering input associated with such instrumentation is expected
          to be low</i> <i>to moderate</i>.</p>
        <p><b>WING POD INTERIOR SPECIFICATIONS:</b> &#160; For &#8216;standard&#8217; wing
          pod mounted instrumentation systems, appropriate attention must be
          paid to pod interior specifications, power, connectivity, dimension
          and weight restrictions. <i>The expected level of aeronautical engineering
          input associated with such instrumentation is&#160; expected to be
          low</i> <i>to moderate, given accepted wing pod module design</i>.</p>
        <p><b>EXTERNALLY MOUNTED PROBES:</b> &#160; For externally (fuselage
          or wing mounted) exposed probes and inlets aerodynamic load analyses
          may be required, as will consideration of optimum probe and inlet siting
          in the aircraft&#8217;s aerodynamic skin. <i>The expected level of
          aeronautical engineering input associated with such instrumentation
          is expected to be&#160; moderate to high, given accepted probe design</i>.</p>
        <p><b>FUSELAGE MODIFICATION:</b> For instrumentation systems that require
          access to aperture pads and or plates, optical view ports other than
          those initially specified in the modified HIAPER airframe at time of
          delivery, several design considerations and certification issues accrue. <i>The
          expected level of aeronautical engineering input associated with such
          instrumentation systems is expected to be high and, while not prohibited,
          are not encouraged under this solicitation</i>.</p>
        <h4>Additional Information</h4>
        <p>All proposers are encouraged to contact the HIAPER Project Office
          to obtain information on specific infrastruture requirements of the
          certified Gulfstream V airframe.&#160;&#160;Proposers are also encouraged
          to contact the Design and Fabrication Services Division of the Atmospheric
          Technology Division (NCAR-ATD), through the HIAPER Project Office,&#160;to
          ensure design engineering&#160;will be compatible with the Gulfstream
          V (see Section VIII for contact information).&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Under current FAA and ICAO guidelines, aircraft certification requires
          more stringent design and development processess than a non-certified
          aircraft.&#160; If proposers plan to request the support of&#160;NCAR's
          Design and Fabrication Services these costs should be explicitly&#160;included
          and budgeted for&#160;in the proposal.</p>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc Review
        followed by Panel Review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P> In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after
        his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved
        by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee
        of an eventual award. </P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals

        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants

      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
        special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
        thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
        expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
        any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
        the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
        conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal
        Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement
        or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements. </p>
      <p> *These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a 
  href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm"> https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm</a>.
        Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse,
        telephone (301) 947-2722 or by e-mail from <a 
  href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>. </p>
      <p> More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained
        in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically

      <p><b>Special Award Conditions:</b></p>
      
      <div class="user_input"><a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a>
        <p>Awards will be made as subawards to the Cooperative Support Agreement&#160;with
          UCAR for the management of NCAR.&#160; Otherwise, standard NSF award
          conditions apply.</p>
      </div>
      <a name="reportreq"></a>
      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p><strong>Additional Reporting Requirement</strong></p>
        <p>It is expected that awardees will have regular dialogue and/or status
          reviews with NCAR-ATD technical staff to ensure compatibility and timely
          integration of equipment packages into or onto the HIAPER airframe.&#160; These
          reports will be shared with cognizant NSF Program Officers.</p>
      </div>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
