        <h4>
          General Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) <br>
              Innovative Approaches to Science and Engineering Research on Brain Function
            </p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Computational neuroscience provides a theoretical foundation and a rich set of technical approaches for understanding complex neurobiological systems, building on the theory, methods, and findings of computer science, neuroscience, and numerous other disciplines.</p>
            <p>Through the CRCNS program, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF), the French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR), and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) support collaborative activities that will advance the understanding of nervous system structure and function, mechanisms underlying nervous system disorders, and computational strategies used by the nervous system.</p>
            <p>Two classes of proposals will be considered in response to this solicitation:</p>
            <p><strong>Research Proposals</strong> describing collaborative research projects; and</p>
            <p><strong>Data Sharing Proposals</strong> to enable sharing of data and other resources.</p>
            <p>Domestic and international projects will be considered. As detailed in the solicitation, international components of collaborative projects may be funded in parallel by the participating agencies. Specific CRCNS opportunities for parallel funding are available for bilateral US-German Research Proposals, US-German Data Sharing Proposals, US-French Research Proposals, US-French Data Sharing Proposals, US-Israeli Research Proposals, US-Israeli Data Sharing Proposals, and multilateral proposals involving the United States and 2 or more partnering countries (Germany, France, and/or Israel).</p>
            <p>Appropriate scientific areas of investigations may be related to the interests of any of the participating funding organizations. Questions concerning a particular project's focus, direction and relevance to a participating funding organization should be addressed to the appropriate person in the list of agency contacts found in Section VIII of the solicitation.</p>
            <p><strong>NSF will coordinate and manage the review of proposals jointly with participating domestic and foreign funding organizations, through a joint panel review process used by all participating funders.</strong> Additional information is available in Section VI of the solicitation.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>One of the most exciting and difficult challenges for contemporary science and engineering is to understand complex neurobiological systems, from genetic determinants to cellular processes to the complex interplay of neurons, circuits, and systems orchestrating behavior and cognition. Disorders of the nervous system are also associated with complex neurobiological changes, which may lead to profound alterations at all levels of organization. The computational principles and strategies of the nervous system have implications for biological and engineered systems alike, opening new avenues for discovery, application, and invention.</p>
          <p>Computational neuroscience provides a theoretical foundation and a rich set of technical approaches for understanding the principles and dynamics of the nervous system. Building on the theory, methods, and findings of computer science, neuroscience, biology, the mathematical and physical sciences, the social and behavioral sciences, engineering, and other fields, computational neuroscience employs a broad spectrum of approaches to study structure, function, organization, and computation across all levels of the nervous system. Advances in computational neuroscience are being accelerated by new methods for integrating and analyzing complex data; conceptual frameworks deriving from many different theoretical sources; and new modalities for large-scale data collection, simulation and modeling, and fine experimental manipulation.</p>
          <p>Furthering these advances, collaboration plays a pivotal role. Collaborative research enables close interaction between theory, modeling, simulation and analysis, and experimental neuroscience. This provides a framework for interpretation of empirical data, quantitative hypotheses for empirical testing, and grounding of theories and models in an empirical and evaluation context. International collaborations bring together diverse research perspectives, expand the range of research partnerships, and develop a community of globally engaged scientists and engineers. Sharing of data, software, and other resources provides a powerful modality for larger-scale interaction and collaborative discovery.</p>
          <p>Research and research communities supported by the participating funding organizations encompass complementary approaches and investigator communities whose integrative efforts are needed for the advancement of computational neuroscience; thus, cooperation among agencies in this area is appropriate and essential. Through the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF), the French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR), and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) support collaborative activities that will span the full spectrum of computational neuroscience research, thereby advancing the understanding of nervous system structure and function, mechanisms underlying nervous system disorders, and computational strategies used by the nervous system.</p>
          <p>The participating funding organizations have released parallel documents with further agency-specific information, referenced in Section VIII of this solicitation.</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Two classes of proposals will be considered in response to this solicitation: <strong>Research Proposals</strong> describing collaborative research projects; and <strong>Data Sharing Proposals</strong> to enable sharing of data and other resources. Domestic and international projects will be considered, as detailed in Sections V.A. and VIII of this solicitation.</p>
          <p>In general, appropriate scientific areas of investigations may be related to the missions and strategic objectives of any of the participating funding organizations. Some specific examples are given at the end of this section. Questions concerning a particular project's focus, direction and relevance to a participating funding organization should be addressed to the appropriate person in the list of agency contacts.</p>
          <p>Each of the funding organizations participating in this program has a commitment to developing and supporting computational neuroscience research for the purpose of advancing the understanding of the neuroscience questions relevant to the missions of the organizations. Proposals selected for funding must be responsive to the mission of a participating funding organization.</p>
          <p><strong>Assurance of Innovative Collaborative Research Effort Across Scientific Disciplines: </strong>The driving principle behind this program is the recognition that projects crossing traditional academic disciplinary boundaries often bring about increased productivity, creativity, and capacity to tackle major challenges. Collaborative efforts that bring together investigators with complementary experience and training, and deep understanding of multiple scholarly fields, are a requirement for this program and must be convincingly demonstrated in the proposal. A typical research collaboration might involve a computer scientist and a neurobiologist, for example, though note that this solicitation does not prescribe any particular mix of disciplinary backgrounds or scientific approaches. Proposals for research projects should describe collaborations that bring together the complementary expertise needed to achieve significant advances on challenging interdisciplinary problems. Proposals for data sharing should describe resources that respond to the needs of a broad community of investigators to enable wide-ranging research advances.</p>
          <p>This program emphasizes innovative research and resources, encouraging the application and development of state-of-the-art computational methods by theorists, computational scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and statisticians to tackle dynamic and complex neuroscience problems.</p>
          <p>Computational research supported under this program must relate to biological processes and should lead to hypotheses that are testable in biological studies. It is expected that: (1) research collaborations will build on complementary investigator expertise in computation or modeling, theory, and/or experimental neuroscience; (2) the collaborations should involve a dynamic and possibly protracted period of development and refinement of models, theories, and/or analytical techniques, and intense interactions among scientists and engineers from different disciplines; and (3) the development and testing of new models or theories should provide a framework for the design of experiments and the generation of new hypotheses that can help reveal mechanisms and processes underlying normal or diseased states of the nervous system.</p>
          <p><strong>Sharing of Data, Software, and Other Resources: </strong>Sharing of data and software is highly recommended in all CRCNS projects, to facilitate the translation and dissemination of research results, to accelerate the development of generalizable approaches and tools that can be put to wide use by researchers, and to broaden the scope of collaboration in computational neuroscience and related communities.</p>
          <p>Data Sharing Proposals may relate to any of the scientific topics that would be appropriate for Research Proposals under this solicitation. Data sharing projects should be specifically aimed at the preparation and deployment of data, software, code bases, stimuli, models, or other resources in a manner that is responsive to the needs of a broad community of researchers, for example, by providing a coherent collection of data and other resources covering a set of topics, systems, or methods of interest. The major innovation and intellectual merit of a data sharing proposal could be in the breadth, depth, or importance of the resources being shared. Technical innovation (e.g., to facilitate usability, access, and integration), and thoughtful approaches to community development and continuous improvement, are encouraged as needed to make the proposed resources maximally effective. CRCNS support for data sharing focuses primarily on data and other resources, not more general infrastructure, or research to acquire the data. Proposers of data sharing projects are strongly encouraged to build on existing facilities and services where possible, rather than develop infrastructure from scratch.</p>
          <p>All CRCNS investigators are encouraged to coordinate with other data sharing projects and related activities, including national and international efforts to develop sustainable, extensible neuroscience resources. Further information about resources for data sharing is available on the CRCNS program web site (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crcns/">https://www.nsf.gov/crcns/</a>).</p>
          <p>Innovative educational and training opportunities are highly encouraged, to develop research capacity in computational neuroscience, to broaden participation in research and education, and to increase the impact of computational neuroscience research. Activities at all levels of educational and career development are welcome under this solicitation. International research experiences for students and early-career researchers are highly encouraged in all projects involving international collaborations.</p>

        <h3> 
          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
         
          <p>As in previous years, there will be a minimum of $5 million available each year for this competition, with potentially $15 to $20 million annually, depending on the quality of proposals and availability of funds.</p>
          <p>Award sizes for Research Projects (both domestic and international) are expected to range from approximately $100,000 to $250,000 per year in direct costs, with durations of three to five years. Many awards will be on the smaller end of this range. Proposers are strongly discouraged from requesting greater budgets than are necessary for the activities being proposed. Investigators contemplating four- or five-year projects are advised to discuss their project requirements with the appropriate agency contact(s) before submitting. The expected range of award sizes applies to the combined direct costs, expressed in US Dollars, of all components of a collaborative project for which funding is being sought from participating funders, including components inside and outside of the United States. The expected range of award sizes does not include the costs of foreign travel to international partnering institutions. International travel costs can be expected to vary depending on the countries and specific proposed activities, and could result in combined direct costs that exceed the expected range.</p>
          <p>Awards for Data Sharing Projects will be scaled according to the needs of the project; typically they will be smaller in size than research awards. Investigators are encouraged to discuss their project requirements with the CRCNS Program Coordinator - NSF before submitting.</p>
          <p>Estimated program budget, number of awards, and average award size and duration are subject to the availability of funds.</p>
          <p>Upon conclusion of the review process, meritorious research proposals may be recommended for funding by one or more of the participating funding organizations, at the option of the funders, not the proposer. Subsequent grant administration procedures will be in accordance with the individual policies of the awarding agency.</p>
          <p>Further information about agency processes and agency-specific award information is provided in Section VI.B. and Section VIII of this solicitation.</p>

          VI. PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
       
        <p><strong>NSF will coordinate and manage the review of proposals jointly with participating domestic and foreign funding organizations, through a joint panel review process used by all participating funders.</strong> <strong>  </strong>Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared between the participating organizations as appropriate.  Further information on the processes and requirements of participating funding organizations is detailed in this Section and in Section VIII of this solicitation.</p>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot;  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
              </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
              </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
              </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol>
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
      
        <p>For this solicitation, clinical and technological applications are specifically included among the societally relevant outcomes that could be related to a project's broader impacts, in addition to the potential outcomes listed above.</p>
        <p>The following additional review criterion reflects this solicitation's central goal of enabling high-quality collaborative research. Following are suggested considerations pertaining to the quality and value of collaboration, not all of which will necessarily apply to any given proposal:</p>
        <p><strong><em>Quality and value of collaboration</em></strong><br />
          Is the expertise of the proposers complementary and well-suited to the problems being addressed? Does the collaboration productively bring together new combinations of investigators, approaches, or resources? Are the specific roles of each collaborating investigator clear? Is the collaborative activity coordinated efficiently and effectively? To what extent will it contribute to the advancement of multiple collaborating disciplines? To what extent will it lead to the development of high-quality resources that will be useful to the research community at large? To what extent will it provide unique collaborative research experiences for participating students and early-career researchers?</p>
        <p>For proposals involving international collaborations, reviewers will consider: mutual benefits, true intellectual collaboration with the foreign partner(s), benefits to be realized from the expertise and specialized skills, facilities, sites and/or resources of the international counterpart, and active research engagement of U.S. students and early-career researchers, where such individuals are engaged in the research.</p>
        <p><strong>NIH Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>The mission of the NIH is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life and reduce illness and disability. In their evaluations of <strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>, reviewers will be asked to consider the following criteria that are used by NIH:</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Impact. </strong>Reviewers will provide an overall impact/priority score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following five core review criteria, and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).</p>
        <p><strong><em>Significance.</em></strong> Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?</p>
        <p><strong><em>Investigator(s).</em></strong> Are the PD/PIs, collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?</p>
        <p><strong><em>Innovation. </em></strong>Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?</p>
        <p><strong><em>Approach.</em></strong> Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?</p>
        <p>If the project involves clinical research, are the plans for 1) protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?</p>
        <p><strong><em>Environment. </em></strong>Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?</p>
        <p class="regulartext">Where applicable, the following items will also be considered:</p>
        <p class="regulartext"><strong><em>Protections for Human Subjects. </em></strong>For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.</p>
        <p class="regulartext">For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children. </em></strong>When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed.</p>
        <p class="regulartext"><strong><em>Vertebrate Animals.</em></strong> The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of procedures involving animals including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information, see <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/VASchecklist.pdf">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/VASchecklist.pdf</a>.</p>
        <p class="regulartext"><strong><em>Biohazards.</em></strong> Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Budget and Period of Support. </strong></em>Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>NSF Process: </strong>Those proposals selected for funding by NSF will be handled in accordance with standard NSF procedures. After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p><strong>NIH Process:</strong> For those proposals that are selected for potential funding by participating NIH Institutes or Centers, the PI will be required to resubmit the proposal in an NIH-approved format directly to the Center for Scientific Review (<a href="http://www.csr.nih.gov/">http://www.csr.nih.gov/</a>) of the NIH.  PIs invited to resubmit to NIH will receive further information on resubmission procedures from NIH. An applicant will not be allowed to increase the proposed budget or change the scientific content of the application in the resubmission to the NIH. NIH budgets may not exceed $250,000 in direct costs, and the total direct costs requested for the all years may not exceed the total requested on the NSF application. However, in some cases, NIH Institutes may request that the budget request be reallocated across the years of the grant to conform to NIH modular budget practices.  Indirect costs on any foreign subawards/subcontracts will be limited to eight (8) percent.  Applicants will be expected to utilize the Multiple Principal Investigator option at the NIH (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/multi_PI/">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/multi_PI/</a>) as appropriate.  These NIH applications will be entered into the NIH IMPAC II system. The results of the review will be presented to the involved Institutes' or Centers' National Advisory Councils for the second level of review. Subsequent to the Council reviews, NIH Institutes and Centers will make their funding determinations and selected awards will be made.  Subsequent grant administration procedures for NIH awardees, including those related to New and Early Stage Investigators (<a title="blocked::http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/" href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/</a>), will be in accordance with the policies of NIH.  Applications selected for NIH funding will use the NIH R01 funding mechanism.</p>
        <p>At the end of the project period, renewal applications for projects funded by the NIH are expected to be submitted directly to the NIH as Renewal Applications, rather than as proposals to the CRCNS program.  Principal Investigators should contact their NIH Program Officer for additional information.  For informational purposes, NIH Principal Investigators may wish to consult the NIAID web site, "All About Grants," which provides excellent generic information about all aspects of NIH grantsmanship, including Renewal Applications (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/researchfunding/grant/pages/aag.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/researchfunding/grant/pages/aag.aspx</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>BMBF Process:</strong> On the basis of the evaluation, suitable project ideas will be selected for funding. The applicants will be informed in writing of the result of the selection procedure.</p>
        <p>In the second phase of the procedure, applicants whose applications have received a positive evaluation will be invited to present a formal application for funding. A decision will be made after a final evaluation. Forms for funding applications, guidelines, leaflets, information and auxiliary terms and conditions are available on the Internet at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.foerderportal.bund.de/">http://www.foerderportal.bund.de/</a> or can be obtained from the project management organization. Applicants are strongly advised to use the electronic application system "easy" to draft (project outlines and) formal applications (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.foerderportal.bund.de/">http://www.foerderportal.bund.de/</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>ANR Process: </strong> Taking into consideration the joint panel review recommendation outcome and consultation with the participating funding organizations, ANR will select the projects to be funded. ANR will inform the French applicants of the outcome of the selection. After programmatic approval, the grant agreements of the selected projects will be issued in accordance with ANR standard funding regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>BSF Process: </strong>BSF requires parallel submission of the proposal by the U.S. and Israeli PIs, according to its submission regulations and using an identical project description to that submitted to the NSF. However, BSF will not conduct an independent selection process, but rather will review the research programs selected for funding by the NSF and/or NIH and include Israeli PIs, and in most cases fund them if sufficient resources are available. BSF will notify all applicants of the results and online availability of the review material. BSF submission instructions can be found using the link: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.bsf.org.il/ElectronicSubmission/GatewayFormsAndGuidelines.aspx?PageId=7&amp;innerTextID=0">http://www.bsf.org.il/ElectronicSubmission/GatewayFormsAndGuidelines.aspx?PageId=7&amp;innerTextID=0</a></p>

        <p>Notification of an NSF award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>Attribution of support in publications must acknowledge the joint program, as well as the funding organization and award number, by including a phrase such as, &quot;as part of the NSF/NIH/ANR/BMBF/BSF Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience Program.&quot;</p>
        <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants awarded by NSF (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions.  PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system.  Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <p><strong>ABOUT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH</strong></p>
        <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. NIH works toward that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of medical information. The NIH institutes and centers participating in this program contribute to NIH's mission through research efforts aimed at understanding, treating, and preventing disease states that involve or are related to the nervous system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. NINDS supports research projects that range from basic studies of the nervous system to Phase III clinical trials. Through the CRCNS program, NINDS will <strong>not</strong> support definitive clinical trials of therapeutic devices, such as a traditional feasibility study and/or pivotal trial (see <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulati%20onandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM279103.pdf2">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulati%20onandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM279103.pdf2</a> for the definition of an early feasibility study, feasibility study and pivotal trial). The NINDS is interested in supporting collaborative research in innovative computational analysis, simulation and modeling of physiological and pathological structures and functions of the nervous system, and mechanisms underlying neurological neuromuscular and neurovascular disorders.</li>
          <li>The mission on NIMH is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  NIMH supports research programs in neuroscience and basic behavioral science, genomics, technology development, translational research, global mental health, and services and intervention. The <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/index.shtml">NIMH Strategic Plan for Research</a> provides a broad roadmap for the Institute&rsquo;s research priorities, encompassing a range from fundamental science of the brain and behavior to public health impact. For specifics about the NIMH strategic plan for research, please see: <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/index.shtml">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/index.shtml</a>.</li>
          <li>NIDA supported research is aimed at increasing the understanding of the causes and consequences of drug abuse and addiction. NIDA supports a broad research program in basic and clinical research, neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, behavioral sciences and services research.</li>
          <li>NEI supports basic and clinical research aimed at increasing our understanding of the eye and the visual system in normal health and disease.</li>
