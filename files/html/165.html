        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers focused on major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges. CCIs that address these challenges will produce transformative research, lead to innovation, and attract broad scientific and public interest. CCIs are agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities and make full use of data infrastructure and other approaches to enhance collaborations. CCIs may partner with researchers from industry, government laboratories and international organizations. CCIs integrate research, innovation, education, broadening participation, and informal science communication.</p>
            <p>The CCI Program is a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation. Phase I CCIs receive significant resources to develop the science, management and broader impacts of a major research center before requesting Phase II funding. Satisfactory progress in Phase I is required for Phase II applications; Phase I proposals funded in FY 2017 will seek Phase II funding in FY 2020.</p>
            <p>The FY 2017 Phase I CCI competition is open to projects in all fields supported by the Division of Chemistry, and must have focus and impact in chemistry. This solicitation also covers the renewal application of the Phase II CCI initiated in FY 2012: the Center for Selective C-H Functionalization (CCHF). </p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers focused on major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges. CCIs that address these challenges will produce transformative research, lead to innovation, and attract broad scientific and public interest. CCIs are agile structures that respond rapidly to emerging opportunities, promote synergy and potentially transformative research, and make full use of data infrastructure and other approaches to enhance collaborations. CCIs may partner with researchers from industry, government laboratories and international organizations. CCIs integrate research, innovation, education, broadening participation, and informal science communication.</p>
        
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>CCI awards support the formation and development (Phase I) or sustained funding (Phase II) of research centers that can address major research challenges in fundamental chemistry. Successful centers will tackle challenges of large scope and impact, producing transformative research leading to innovation and enhanced economic competitiveness. CCI awards will bring researchers with shared and complementary interests into productive contact to foster synergy, potentially transformative research, and innovation. </p>
          <p>In FY 2017, the Division of Chemistry is considering both Phase I proposals and a Phase II renewal. Both phases are described in this solicitation. The FY 2017 Phase I CCI competition is open to projects in all fields supported by the Division of Chemistry, and must have focus and impact in chemistry. This solicitation also covers the renewal application of the Phase II CCI initiated in FY 2012: the Center for Selective C-H Functionalization (CCHF). </p>
          <p>CCIs are built around a compelling research challenge. The proposed research should be ambitious and potentially transformative. Novel ways for public access and utilization of data towards discovery-based science are encouraged.  Discovery-based science, or discovery science,  is an approach that enables analysis of collections of data with the goal of identifying new patterns or correlations, leading to new scientific results. The CCI Program is particularly interested in supporting science that cannot be effectively done by individual investigators or small teams. Synergy is explicitly evaluated during the review process. </p>
          <p>The team of investigators for a Phase I proposal must include at least four senior researchers with complementary expertise. While there is no upper limit on the number of Phase I investigators, the available resources should be carefully considered in assembling the team. CCIs may partner with researchers from industry, national laboratories and international organizations. See detailed guidance below for non-U.S. or non-academic researchers.</p>
          <p>Effective center management includes careful evaluation of the research and broader impacts; promotion and evaluation of synergy in center activities; development and implementation of strategic plans, including data management and diversity plans; allocation of resources; the ability to initiate new lines of research and terminate support for lower priority efforts; and communication throughout the center and with partners.</p>
          <p>Center-wide data management plans will describe how all center researchers will store, access, share and archive data, with particular emphasis on data-sharing across collaborative teams. In the Phase I proposal, proposers will briefly describe how they will develop a center-wide data management plan. If funded as a Phase I CCI, teams will develop a data management plan and submit it to the CCI Program for review and feedback (see award conditions). The data management  plan will be a required element of a Phase II proposal and will be evaluated during the merit review process as an aspect of Center Management. Implementation of the data management plan will be monitored on an ongoing basis for funded Phase II awards.  </p>
          <p>The requirement for a center-wide diversity plan is new with this FY 2017 program solicitation. Diversity plans outline the context, goals and specific actions for promoting diversity within the center's supported researchers (faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students). The implementation is similar to the data management plan described above. In the Phase I proposal, proposers will briefly describe how they will develop a diversity plan. If funded as a Phase I CCI, teams will develop a diversity plan and submit it to the CCI Program Directors for review and feedback. The diversity plan will be a required element of a Phase II proposal and will be evaluated during the merit review process as an aspect of Center Management and Broadening Participation. Implementation of the diversity plan will be monitored on an ongoing basis for funded Phase II awards. </p>
          <p>CCIs are expected to integrate their research with activities that broaden the impact of their research. The following broader impact components are required throughout the lifetime of a CCI award:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Innovation - translation or transfer of basic research results into social or economic benefit. This element includes intellectual property protection and a proactive plan to either engage industry in technology transfer or to commercialize technology in other ways.</li>
            <li>Higher Education and Professional Development - education and professional development  for undergraduate and graduate students supported by the grant, including co-mentorship or other collaborative training and continued professional development and mentoring for postdoctoral research associates. This may also include education in various aspects of innovation (intellectual property, entrepreneurship, etc.) and other education activities (i.e., new course materials or curricula) that affect the university or universities involved in the CCI.</li>
            <li>Broadening the participation of underrepresented groups - CCI goals for increasing diversity, plans for reaching those goals, and an evaluation strategy. This includes developing a diversity plan for the Center's researchers (faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers) during Phase I, and implementing it during Phase II. </li>
            <li>Informal science communication - plans for communicating the CCI research to public audiences and possible ways to evaluate the impact of these outreach efforts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Phase I awardees must complete research, center development, and broader impact activities. The center development is focused around strategic planning, including center-wide data management plans and diversity plans. All elements of the strategic plan must be completed within 15 months of the start of the Phase I award. Additional milestones during Phase I include a mandatory oversight review (approximately 16-18 months after the start of the Phase I award); submission of a Phase II proposal (approximately 25 months after the start date of the Phase I award); and a reverse site visit to NSF Headquarters (approximately 30 months after the start of the Phase I award). The Phase I award should include sufficient budget to complete all of these in an effective and timely way. Additional information is provided in the proposal preparation guidance for a Phase I full proposal. </p>
          <p>CCIs may partner with researchers from industry or government laboratories. CCIs are encouraged to develop collaborations that involve sending U.S. students and postdoctoral researchers to conduct collaborative research with non-academic partners and to host non-academic researchers for research visits at CCI sites. NSF funds may be used to support the costs of such research visits. NSF does not normally support research or education activities by scientists, engineers or educators employed by Federal agencies or Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). A CCI considering funding a partner in a Federal agency or FFRDC must provide a compelling argument that their proposed funded collaboration can make unique contributions to the CCI project. Industrial and government partners must provide a letter of collaboration in the supplementary documents section of the Phase II full proposal.</p>
          <p>CCIs may also partner with researchers from international organizations. CCIs are encouraged to develop collaborations that involve sending U.S. students and junior researchers to conduct collaborative research at international partner organizations. NSF awards are normally limited to support of the U.S. portion of the collaboration.  Although reciprocal visits by international researchers and students to the U.S. institutions are encouraged, NSF will not usually pay for the expenses of foreign scientists or students undertaking such visits. However, for projects involving exchanges of researchers and/or students, reciprocal arrangements are encouraged, with adherence to the overall principle that each side supports equivalent costs. No grant funds may be subawarded to international organizations. In CCI projects where collaborators are scientists and engineers from a developing country or from a country whose currency is not convertible, limited funds may be requested to support their participation in the project; proposers should consult with the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) program officer(s) responsible for the country(ies) in question (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=OISE">http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=OISE</a>)  International partners will provide a letter of collaboration in the supplementary documents section of the Phase I or Phase II proposal.</p>
          <p>Principal Investigators should ensure that their proposed project does not substantially overlap with ongoing Federally funded research. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation may be shared with other Federal agencies, including (but not limited to) the Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Office of Naval Research, and the Intelligence Community.  Reviews, including panel summaries, if applicable, may also be shared.  The reasons for sharing these proposals and reviews include potential co-funding as well as avoiding duplication of Federal funding for a particular research project.  If the PI or awardee organization does not wish the proposal to be shared with a particular Federal agency or agencies, they should provide a Single Copy Document with the proposal stating which Federal funding agencies should be excluded.  No explanations for exclusion are required.</p>
          <p>Investigators are strongly urged to contact a cognizant Program Officer (listed in Section VIII of this solicitation) when considering submitting a proposal.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
    
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
      
        <p>In addition to the National Science Board merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to apply the following criteria when reviewing all CCI proposals: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To what extent is the scientific vision commensurate with a center investment?</li>
          <li>To what extent is there the potential for transformative impact in chemistry?</li>
          <li>To what extent is there potential for/evidence for synergy or outcomes that would not be likely with individual investigator awards?</li>
          <li>To what extent will the management plan foster the careful evaluation of the research and broader impacts; promotion and evaluation of synergy in center activities; development and implementation of strategic plans, including data management and diversity plans; allocation of resources; the ability to initiate new lines of research and terminate support for lower priority efforts; and communication throughout the center and with partners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reviewers will also be asked to apply the following criterion for CCI Phase II proposals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To what extent is the demonstrated scientific productivity from previous CCI funding commensurate with a center investment?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that site visit reports and other information from previous award periods may be used in the review and recommendation of proposals submitted to this program.</p>
     
    
       <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Site Visit Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>Three different kinds of proposals are described in this solicitation: preliminary proposals for Phase I CCI, full proposals for Phase I CCI, and full proposals for Phase II CCI. The review process is tailored to each type of proposal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preliminary Proposal for Phase I: Panel review, augmented with ad hoc reviews as necessary (expect 35-45 submissions)</li>
          <li>Full Proposal for Phase I: ad hoc reviews and panel review (expect 12-15 submissions)</li>
          <li>Full Proposal for Phase II: ad hoc reviews and a panel/reverse site visit (expect 1 submission)</li>
        </ul>
   
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>Awardees will be required to participate in program-level evaluation by which NSF can assess implementation processes and progress toward program level outcomes.  NSF, an NSF contractor, or a grantee on behalf of NSF, may periodically conduct program evaluations or special projects that necessitate access to project level staff and data.  This activity may occur at any time during the grant period and could occur after the grant has ended.  Project-level participation includes responding to inquiries, interviews and other methods of common data collection and/or aggregation across individual grants.  In addition, PIs and project-level evaluators will be asked to assist in developing a program evaluation that will mutually benefit the agency and program participants.</p>
       <p> <strong>TBD - Programmatic Terms and Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>For Phase II awards, draft CCI-specific Programmatic Terms and Conditions are available on the CCI Program Page (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13635&amp;org=CHE">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13635&amp;org=CHE</a>).

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
