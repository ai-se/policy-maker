        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are jointly funding university/industry R&amp;D  in the area of renewable hydrogen technology development through this program solicitation issued by the NSF Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.  Proposals are invited to specifically address discovery and development of advanced materials systems and chemical processes for direct photochemical and/or thermochemical water splitting for application in the solar production of hydrogen fuel. Projects are encouraged which advance scientific frontiers in photochemical and/or thermochemical materials systems and interfacial processes utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies in theory, synthesis and characterization to enhance scientific understanding of  the important fundamental physical, thermal, chemical, electrochemical and opto-electronic processes which are critical to efficient and durable solar hydrogen production.  A key benefit of this joint effort is the direct coordination of NSF-funded use-inspired basic research and EERE-funded applied R&amp;D toward the development of cost-effective large-scale systems for the low-carbon production of hydrogen through advanced solar water-splitting technologies.</p>
          <p>Widespread use of hydrogen and fuel cells can play a substantial role in overcoming our nation's key energy challenges, including significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption as well as improvements in air quality.  A study by the National Academies has shown that by 2050, fuel cell electric vehicles could provide the largest reduction in emissions and oil consumption of any advanced vehicles [National Research Council. 2008: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12222.html">http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12222.html</a>].  In addition, hydrogen and fuel cells provide a significant economic opportunity for the United States, with various studies projecting up to 900,000 new jobs in the U.S. by 2030- 2035 [The US DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program Plan. 2011:<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/program_plan2011.pdf">http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/program_plan2011.pdf</a> ].  Growing interest and investment among leading world economies, such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea, underscores the global market potential for these technologies and the need for continued investment for industry to remain competitive.  To achieve the broadest commercialization of fuel cells, it will be necessary to have an affordable and abundant supply of fuel that can be used in all sectors and for diverse applications.  </p>
          <p>Of all possible fuels for fuel cells, hydrogen can be produced from the most diverse pathways, utilizing the most abundant resources, and it can be used in all fuel cell applications.  However, hydrogen also poses the most significant technical challenges, including the high cost of production and delivery, and the need for improved performance and lower cost hydrogen storage systems.  R&amp;D investments that seek to improve the performance and cost of a broad portfolio of technologies for producing, delivering, and storing hydrogen are essential for large-scale realization of the significant national benefits of widespread fuel cell deployment.  As indicated in the US DOE Multi-year Research, Development and Demonstration (MYRD&amp;D) plan [ <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/mypp/pdfs/production.pdf">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/mypp/pdfs/production.pdf</a>] cost-effective pathways to renewable, low-carbon hydrogen production will be necessary.  The photochemical and thermochemical technologies for large-scale solar water-splitting are promising, but advanced materials systems and processes need to be discovered and developed for these technologies to be cost competitive.  </p>
          <p>The sub-programs within DOE and NSF that will manage this joint program solicitation to promote the discovery and development of advanced technologies for solar hydrogen production are the Hydrogen Production &amp; Delivery (HPD) Sub-Program within the DOE EERE Fuel Cell Technologies (FCT) Office, and the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program and Energy for Sustainability Program both in the NSF Engineering Directorate, CBET Division.  The FCT Office supports the U.S. DOE mission to strengthen America's energy security, environmental quality, and economic vitality.  These goals are achieved through activities that address the full range of barriers facing the development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cells with the ultimate goals of decreasing our dependence on oil, reducing carbon emissions, and enabling clean, reliable power generation.  Office activities include research, development, demonstration, testing, technology validation, and manufacturing innovation.  The CBET Systems Division supports the NSF's mission of research and education with activities that involve the transformation and/or transport of matter and energy by chemical, thermal, or mechanical means.  CBET research and education contributes significantly to the development of the workforce for major components of the United States economy, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, forest products, metals, petroleum, food, textiles, utilities, and microelectronics.

       <p>   With this joint program solicitation,  the NSF-CBET and DOE-FCT programs establish the basis to develop joint industry/university/laboratory partnerships of funded research to improve performance and ultimately reduce cost of photochemical and/or thermochemical systems for solar hydrogen production.   A key benefit will be direct coordination of NSF-funded use-inspired basic research and EERE-funded applied R&amp;D.  In this way, the expectation is that it will be possible to provide greater relevance to the discovery and development of advanced materials and materials systems for solar hydrogen production than would be possible by each program developing projects independently of the other.</p>
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>This NSF/DOE Partnership is formed with the goal to advance scientific frontiers through the discovery and development of advanced materials systems and processes for photochemical and/or thermochemical solar hydrogen production.  Transformative ideas are solicited in several targeted areas listed below with the potential to enable an increase in the efficiency and durability of materials systems and processes for direct photochemical and/or thermochemical decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen via solar energy input.  Proposals are encouraged that advance transformative ideas to develop the enabling fundamental understanding of materials, materials systems and interfaces key to advancing frontiers in highly-efficient, durable and cost-effective solar water-splitting  based on  photochemical and/or thermochemical processes.</p>
          <p>The overarching goal is the reduction of the discovery and development cycle for innovative materials systems, interfaces and unit process needed to enable efficient, stable, and ultimately cost-effective solar hydrogen production via photochemical and/or thermochemical chemical plants. This goal will be facilitated by use-inspired fundamental research to establish the basis for new concepts, design elements and tools performed through university/industry/national laboratory partnerships.</p>
          <p>Within this context, projects will be encouraged which integrate state-of-the-art methodologies in theory, synthesis and characterization to facilitate the discovery and optimization of novel materials, materials systems and interfacial processes through enhanced scientific understanding of  important fundamental unit processes, such as material/photon interactions (across the full solar spectrum); materials interactions at the nano- through meso-scales; bulk material heat and charge transport mechanisms;  as well as interfacial reactions, kinetics, and corrosion.</p>
          <p>There are various criteria and elements which are important to this Solicitation, and they are described in the Areas of Interest and Required Elements sections below.  PI teams should adhere to these in their proposals.  Sponsors may return proposals without review if the proposal is deemed not to be in compliance with these criteria and element inclusions.  </p>
          <p> <strong>Areas of Interest:</strong></p>
          <p>This solicitation promotes the science and technology of advanced materials systems and interfacial processes as key enablers for highly efficient and durable photochemical and/or thermochemical solar water-splitting.  Specific topical areas are listed below though other aspects that hold promise to improve solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, durability and cost with respect to traditionally-studied photochemical and thermochemical processes may also be considered. </p>
          <p>Key fundamental processes that must be better understood to enable the enhancement of efficiency, stability and ultimately cost in photochemical and/or thermochemical solar water-splitting processes include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Material/light interactions over the full solar spectrum fundamental to photon  absorption and to the conversion of photon energy to thermal and electrochemical energy;</li>
            <li>Thermodynamic properties of materials systems fundamental to driving thermal, chemical and electrochemical processes and sub-processes;</li>
            <li>Thermal and radiative properties of materials systems fundamental to heat transfer efficient thermal management;</li>
            <li>Optoelectronic properties of materials systems fundamental to efficient separation and transport of photo-excited charge carriers to relevant reaction sites for the reactions and sub-reactions in water dissociation cycles;</li>
            <li>Kinetic properties of materials at interfaces fundamental to the facilitation of chemical and electrochemical reactions and sub-reactions in water dissociation cycles, as well as the mitigation of corrosion and other competing side-reactions;</li>
            <li>Physical and surface chemistry of multi-phase materials systems fundamental to compound and  inter-phase formation, mass diffusion properties,  and junction and interface formation and properties;</li>
            <li>Validated ab-initio models to support &quot;Materials by Design&quot; methodologies for bulk materials and interfaces with physical, optical, chemical and electronic properties optimized for solar to hydrogen conversion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Projects are encouraged which integrate state-of-the-art theory, synthesis and characterization methodologies to facilitate the discovery and optimization of novel materials systems and interfaces through enhanced scientific understanding of important unit processes such as material/photon interactions materials interactions at the nano- through meso-scales; bulk material heat and charge transport mechanisms; as well as interfacial reactions, kinetics, corrosion, and phase separation.  </p>
          <p>Relevant topic areas considered responsive to this solicitation include, but are not limited to the theory-guided discovery and development of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Novel multi-component solid-state materials with physical, optical, chemical and electronic properties optimized for photochemical and/or thermochemical solar to hydrogen conversion;</li>
            <li>Innovative materials junctions and interfaces with physical, optical, chemical and electronic properties optimized for photochemical and/or thermochemical solar to hydrogen conversion;</li>
            <li>Innovative catalysts, co-catalysts and appropriate linking apparatus to optimize reaction kinetics of the primary and secondary reactions in photochemical and/or thermochemical cycles for stable and efficient water dissociation;</li>
            <li>Efficient and stable materials and sub-systems for separation of multi-phase reactants and products, including hydrogen/oxygen gas separation in direct photochemical water dissociation and reactant/product management in electrolytic stages of hybrid thermochemical cycles for water splitting.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposals for incremental improvements to traditionally-studied solar water-splitting materials systems incapable of achieving solar hydrogen fuel production rates of 100 J/s of chemical energy per m<sup>2</sup> of solar energy collection (e.g., thermochemical processes based on ceria or zinc oxide, or photochemical processes based on titanium dioxide, tungsten trioxide or iron oxide) will NOT be considered responsive.  Additionally, proposals relying on precious metals or other non-sustainable materials systems for enhancement of efficiency or durability will NOT be considered.</p>
          <p>Of interest are innovative materials and catalyst systems and processes capable of solar hydrogen production rates equal to or greater than 100 J/s-m<sup>2</sup>. The research should focus, though, on the fundamental thermal/physical/chemical/electrochemical/opto-electronic processes of the problem to be investigated including performance assessment rather than on a larger demonstration and testing effort. It is expected that fundamental connections will be made between the understanding of the problem to be studied on a sub-process scale and the associated  efficiency and durability gains projected for integrated solar-to-hydrogen processes based on photochemical and/or thermochemical conversion.</p>
          <p> <strong>Required Elements:</strong></p>
          <p>Successful proposals will involve collaborations between a lead academic PI and with industry, and/or other academic and/or national laboratory collaborators that provide complementary experimental/modeling/facility capabilities. PI teams will not be at a disadvantage in the proposal competition if they do not have access to solar-to-hydrogen validation facilities to demonstrate the efficacy of their approach. However, it is expected that proposed concepts will establish a clear connection to advancing scientific frontiers in solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and durability in photochemical and/or thermochemical conversion processes, specifically beyond traditionally-studied systems incapable of solar hydrogen production rates over 100 J/s-m<sup>2</sup> . This connection may be accomplished by system-level modeling, by employing modifications yielding self-evident efficiency improvements by bench-scale experiments, or by testing in an actual bench-scale solar-to-hydrogen system with the unit-process under investigation operated under simulated conditions consistent with stand-alone field operations under sunlight. </p>
          <p>The proposal narrative should detail what each collaborator contributes to the project, and how the collaboration will be effectively coordinated and managed.  Budgets must include travel for at least one PI to attend DOE's Annual Merit Review in Washington, DC, and up to two additional technical meetings, including the NSF CBET Division Annual Grantee's Meeting in Washington, D.C., and an appropriate technical conference/symposium (preferably ones held in conjunction with a DOE Working Group Meeting on Photoelectrochemical or Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Production).</p>
          <p>In preparing proposals in response to this solicitation, the text should not devote considerable space to background and motivation related to the importance of improving the efficiency and durability of solar hydrogen production in the context of the National and Global energy picture;  rather, the narrative should, within the page limit established by these guidelines, discuss in sufficient detail the research plans to enable evaluation of the approach and methods that would be brought to bear to meet project objectives. The intellectual merit and the innovation of the research proposed in the context of the existing state-of-the-art should be clearly emphasized.  </p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
          </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
          </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>The proposal should define a bold (multidisciplinary) research agenda consistent with the goals and deliverables described in the solicitation.  The evaluation of potentially transformative nature of the project and its translational impacts will be emphasized as well.</p>
        <p>The proposal should also draw on productive intellectual partnerships that capitalize upon knowledge and expertise synergies in multiple fields or sub-fields in science or engineering and/or in multiple types of organizations. </p>
        <p>Reviewers will also be asked to provide an evaluation of whether the proposed project has the potential for significant advances in fundamentals and the demonstrable potential for improving on the existing technology for hydrogen production via solar water splitting.  Special emphasis will be placed on proposals that promise to enhance competitiveness or innovation in the United States.</p>
        <p>NSF will manage and conduct the review process of proposals submitted in accordance with NSF standards and procedures.  Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared with DOE/FCTO. </p>
 

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        <p>NSF will manage and conduct the review process of proposals submitted in accordance with NSF standards and procedures.  Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared with DOE/FCTO.</p>
   
    
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          <p><strong>About the Fuel Cell Technologies Office</strong></p>
          <p>The Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO) is a key component of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) portfolio. The FCTO aims to provide clean, safe, secure, affordable, and reliable energy from diverse domestic resources, providing the benefits of increased energy security and reduced criteria pollutants and green-house gas emissions. More detailed descriptions of the FCTO Hydrogen Production and Delivery (P&amp;D) Program, including technical and cost targets, can be found in the Multi-Year Research, Development and Demonstration Plan (MYRD&amp;D) Chapter for Production.<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
          <p>Fuel cells powered by hydrogen from renewable or low-carbon resources can lead to substantial energy savings and reductions in imported petroleum and carbon emissions. The FCTO Hydrogen P&amp;D Program supports the goals of the DOE and FCTO by addressing critical challenges to integrating hydrogen technology and developing new and advanced technologies to produce hydrogen from diverse, domestic, and renewable resources and additionally, delivering it from where it is produced to the point of end use. </p>
          <p>The objective of the FCTO Hydrogen Production Program is to develop technologies to produce hydrogen from clean, domestic resources at a delivered and dispensed cost of $2-$4/gge H<sub>2 </sub>by 2020.  As a strategy to achieve this objective, the program supports a balanced research and development (R&amp;D) portfolio encompassing various near-, mid- and long-term hydrogen production technologies at distributed, semi-central and central scales.  In the near term, reforming of domestically-abundant natural gas (NG) is viewed as a bridge-technology for producing low-cost hydrogen at high volumes, although with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions commensurate with the fossil fuel feedstock.  In the near- to mid-term, R&amp;D innovations in hybrid systems for NG reforming have the potential to reduce GHG emissions substantially as compared to conventional steam methane reforming while still providing  a means for low cost hydrogen production.  The Program's R&amp;D strategy for longer-term hydrogen production with near-zero GHG emissions focuses on technology pathways utilizing renewable, domestic feedstocks and energy sources.  Of particular interest with regards to longer term hydrogen  production pathways are photoelectrochemical processes based on wide-bandgap semiconductor materials systems and solar thermochemical cycles based on closed-loop chemical reactant materials.  Appropriate balance in the R&amp;D portfolio, which leverages research efforts across DOE Offices and with other agencies (such as NSF), is informed and refined by technoeconomic analysis as well as stakeholder input. <a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
