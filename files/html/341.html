        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>The Division of Polar Programs, in compliance with NSF policy (see Grant Proposal Guide, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a>), expects investigators to share with other researchers, the data and associated metadata, derived data products, samples, physical collections and other supported materials gathered or created in the course of funded research projects. In particular, the Arctic Sciences Section (ARC) of the Division of Polar Programs (PLR) has adopted a policy for data sharing that applies to all grantees that establishes the requirements criteria for the timely archiving of data in long-lived and publicly accessible archives. The goal is to support and facilitate full and open access to data, metadata and digital material from projects supported by ARC programs, including Arctic Social Sciences.</p>
          <p>NSF has invested in cyberinfrastructure activities with the goal of promoting cutting-edge science through the collaboration of domain and computer scientists. Examples of such investments are the EarthCube program  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/">https://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/</a>) and the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program at the Division of Polar Programs.  In particular, the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program supports projects that will accelerate the pace and effectiveness of discovery, innovation and education across the polar disciplines and of advances that improve the capabilities and productivity in supporting cyberinfrastructure elements of computing, data management, information, networking, sensor and software technologies in polar research.</p>
          <p>Over the past decade, NSF has supported projects providing service to ARC-funded investigators for the archiving, accessibility and discovery of data and metadata on long-lived and publicly accessible archives. The Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (CADIS; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.aoncadis.org/">http://www.aoncadis.org/</a>) supported data generated by projects funded by the Arctic Observing Network Program.  The Advanced CADIS (ACADIS) system extended this service to all ARC-funded projects. The ACADIS provides assistance and tools needed to for ARC-funded projects to meet requirements for publishing data and associated metadata.  ACADIS also provides service for the documentation of the datasets to guarantee preservation and to promote interdisciplinary reuse. This solicitation seeks to re-compete the service provided by the ACADIS system.</p>
          <p>In this context, the NSF Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program is soliciting proposals for the archiving, accessibility and discovery of data and metadata generated by projects funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences Section.</p>
        
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>This solicitation invites the submission of proposals for the archival and access of data and metadata generated by projects funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences Section.  Information about the current archive is available at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.aoncadis.org/dashboard.html">https://www.aoncadis.org/dashboard.html</a>.  It is anticipated that the selected project will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide services and tools to enable Principal Investigators to meet NSF requirements for publication of metadata, data, and documentation</li>
            <li>Document datasets to ensure preservation and broad, interdisciplinary reuse</li>
            <li>Archive datasets in accordance with international standards</li>
            <li>Enable broad discovery of NSF Arctic data through diverse national and international portals</li>
            <li>Provide support services and help-desk functions for data providers and users</li>
            <li>Conduct outreach to scientific and public user communities, to promote usage of the data</li>
            <li>Solicit and respond to user community input</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Priority should be given to the cataloging of data for ongoing projects and for projects that expired within the past 5 years.  Datasets generated from projects that expired more than 5 years ago will also be cataloged once the high priority data are ingested. Proposers should include the timeline for cataloging in the management plan.</p>
          <p>Proposers are strongly encouraged to consider the use of cloud-based services.  Both commercial companies and academic institutions developed efficient cloud-based services that provide long-lived and publicly accessible data and metadata.  Cloud service could be considered, for example, for backup purposes, to increase data transfer capabilities for download purposes and to benefit from available web services.</p>
          <p>It is anticipated that the selected project will be funded as a cooperative agreement.</p>
          <p><strong>ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Other NSF Funding Opportunities</strong></p>
          <p>See Section IX on Other Programs of Interest and consult the NSF online program guide to browse for funding opportunities (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/browse_all_funding.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/browse_all_funding.jsp</a>).</p>
         
        
        <h3> <a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
   
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>

     <p>   <strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic</strong></p>
        <p>Not Applicable for this solicitation</p>
        <p><strong>Policy for Sharing Scientific Data</strong></p>
        <p>The Arctic Sciences Section (ARC) of the Division of Polar Programs (PLR) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) has adopted a policy for data sharing that will be applied to all grantees. This policy establishes the requirements criteria for the timely archiving of data in long-lived and publicly accessible archives and sets out special conditions applicable to ARC grants. The purpose of this policy is to facilitate full and open access to data, metadata and materials for polar research from projects supported by ARC.</p>
        <p>The Division of Polar Programs, in conformance with NSF policy (see Grant Proposal Guide, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a>), expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data and associated metadata, derived data products, samples, physical collections and other supported materials gathered or created in the course of the research project. Data sets from ARC-supported scientific research should be deposited in archives appropriate for the specific type of data collected.</p>
        <p>Data archives of ARC-supported projects should include easily accessible information about the data holdings (metadata), including quality assessments, supporting ancillary information, and guidance for locating and obtaining the data. National and international data and metadata standards should be used for the collection, processing and communication of ARC-sponsored data sets. The use of graphics to present data or results does not qualify as sharing of scientific data or submission to an archive.</p>
        <p>NSF realizes that on occasion there are data gathered of a particularly sensitive nature, such as the locations of archaeological sites or nest locations of endangered species. It is not the intention of this policy to reveal such information publicly. Discipline standards, indigenous community cultural rules, and state and federal regulations and laws should be followed for these types of data.</p>
        <p><strong>General Data Sharing Policy</strong></p>
        <p>For all ARC supported projects:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Complete metadata must be submitted to a national data center or ARC-approved data center within two years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first.</li>
          <li>All data and derived data products that are appropriate for submission to a national data center or PLR-approved data repository, must be submitted within two years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong> </strong><strong>Responsibilities of Principal Investigators of Awards Funded by the Arctic Sciences Section</strong></p>
        <p>Coordinated programs (multi-investigator and/or multi-agency programs) may (in consultation with the ARC program managers and other funding agencies involved) establish data submission procedures that are more rigorous than those for typical single-investigator projects, as necessary to meet the coordinated mission objectives. Principal Investigators with ARC-funded awards should comply with data policies established for these coordinated programs and submit their data as required to the appropriate repository stipulated by the coordinated program office.</p>
        <p>Compliance with the data guidelines will be considered in the program managers' overall evaluation of a Principal Investigator's prior support record. Annual and final reports may not be approved if program managers determine that data sharing requirements have not been met. This will prevent future funding increments, awards and most other NSF actions for the PI and his or her co-PIs until the requirement is satisfied and the report is approved.</p>
        <p>Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to the cognizant program officer in the Arctic Sciences Section.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
