I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This funding opportunity is aimed at enhancing the innovation impact of NSF's investments in Engineering Research Centers (ERCs).  The first two generations of ERCs (1985-2009) were designed to function through sustained partnerships with their industry and government practitioner partners. These ERC member organizations brought knowledge of industrial and professional practices and needs to academe, and they streamlined the translation of academic research into useful products, processes, and services. However, there were still a large number of discoveries and inventions developed within the ERCs that never reached their full innovation or commercial potential, because the ERC member firms lacked the resources or the technology didn't overlap well with their long term business strategy.</p>
<p>As a result, the Generation Three (Gen-3) ERC Program construct was developed in 2008 to actively seek additional small business partnerships aimed specifically at spinning out center developed technology that was not licensed by the ERC member partners. This new mandate broadens the role of the ERC to include creating and nurturing an innovation ecosystem designed to more effectively impact the development of new products and services delivered into the U. S. economy. Generally, an innovation ecosystem includes the people, institutions, policies, and resources that promote the translation of new ideas into products and processes and services. Similarly, the innovation ecosystem of Gen-3 ERCs is achieved through a symbiotic relationship between the center researchers, small businesses, large industrial and practitioner partners, and other partner organizations devoted to stimulating entrepreneurship and innovation. As such, the Gen-3 ERCs will continue nurturing the sustained partnerships of the original ERC model, while also proactively seeking ways to translate ERC technology developments to the market that are not being developed with the resources of one of the partners. While not required, many Gen-2 and recently graduated ERCs have pursued translational research partnerships under the Gen-3 protocol to accelerate the entry of their technology into the marketplace. </p>
<p class="Default"><strong>Option 1:</strong> This funding option is aimed at developing generic hardware or software technologies that derive from ERC research discoveries and proof-of-concept testbeds by having the <em>active or self-sustaining ERCs</em> form collaborations with fiscally viable small firms. Beyond that, this solicitation seeks to maximize the leverage of NSF's earlier technology investments via technology translation by preferentially supporting the translation of ERC technologies that undergird strategically identified <strong>platform technologies</strong>. The identification of a platform technology is an option, not a requirement, in this solicitation. </p>
<p><strong>Platform technologies</strong> are generically defined as a set of technologies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are related; </li>
<li>Are common to different businesses and product families;</li>
<li>Are distinctive and can provide competitive advantage;</li>
<li>Enable and accelerate a broad range product development (tools, methods, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the business world, platform technologies are important because they provide a framework for reusing an initial investment in technological know-how in different markets and businesses in order to gain a competitive advantage. "A platform may include physical components, tools and rules to facilitate development, a collection of technical standards to support interoperability, or any combination of these things. Serving as a stable nexus or foundation, a platform can organize the technical development of interchangeable, complementary components and permit them to interact with one another." See for example,<br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://kevinboudreau.com/PAPER%20Open%20Platform%20Complement%20Draft.pdf">http://kevinboudreau.com/PAPER%20Open%20Platform%20Complement%20Draft.pdf</a>. 
</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLES OF PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES: 
</strong>Computers are one of the most familiar examples of a technology platform that beautifully illustrates how physical components can be designed with hardware and software interface standards that make them interoperable. </em></p>
<p>An example of an ERC platform technology would be the image extraction techniques that were developed at the Center for SubSurface Imaging Systems (CenSSIS) to differentiate the target of interest from irrelevant clutter and scattered radiation. The CenSSIS image extraction framework have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems in underwater imagery, underground imagery, medical imagery inside the body, and 3-D biological microscopy inside a cell or collection of cells.</p>
<p>Both Non-platform and Platform Technologies are eligible for an award. The solicitation encourages proposals for both non-platform and platform technologies that have high impact potential. </p>
<p><strong>Option 2: </strong> This funding option is targeted to improve the competitiveness of small firms with <em>active</em>
<em>NSF Phase II SBIR/STTR</em> awards by having them partner with active or self-sustaining graduated ERCs. <em>Active NSF Phase II SBIR/STTR</em> recipients are the elite subset of firms who have a demonstrated track record of successfully implementing innovative research. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are designed to stimulate technological innovation in the private sector by strengthening the role of small business concerns in meeting federal research and development needs, increasing the commercial application of federally supported research results, and fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. </p>

II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This program seeks to combine the innovations arising from NSF's investment in strategically planned, cross-disciplinary Engineering Research Center's (ERC) with the technology translation and business acumen of the small business sector, including that developed from NSF's investment in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs and other fiscally viable small R&amp;D firms. 
</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation-sponsored ERCs are cross-disciplinary, multi-university centers located at universities all across the United States, each operating in close partnership with industry; and, some also with additional government-agency or other service sector partners. Each ERC provides an environment in which academe and industry collaborate in pursuing strategic advances in complex engineered systems and enabling systems-level technologies that have the potential to spawn whole new industries or to radically transform the product lines, processing technologies, or service delivery methodologies of current industries. Activity within ERCs lies at the interface between the discovery-driven culture of science and the innovation-driven culture of engineering and industry. The centers provide the intellectual foundation for industry to collaborate with faculty and students in resolving long-range challenges, producing the knowledge needed for steady advances in technology and their speedy transition to the marketplace. More information can be found at:
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.erc-assoc.org/">http://www.erc-assoc.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The SBIR/STTR program stimulates entrepreneurship in this country through government support for research in small businesses. These small business concerns often need additional research to commercialize their products and/or services. One method of providing this needed research is by enabling small businesses to collaborate with an ERC. More information can be found at:
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/</a>.</p>
<p>Under Option 1, the proposed funding request must be centered on research that is mutually beneficial to the ERC and the proposing fiscally viable small business concern. In particular, the small business should define a role that will align with the ERC's technology translation goal. 
</p>
<p>Under Option 2, if the small business concern is an active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardee, the proposed research may also be aimed at leveraging ERC technology to help improve the competitive position of the proposing SBIR/STTR firm. </p>
<p>Thus, the solicitation serves the following dual purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speed the translation of ERC-generated research and technology advances to the marketplace (or its implementation into critical public service infrastructure) and engage undergraduate and graduate students more directly in the innovation process though collaboration between an ERC and a fiscally viable small business concern;</li>
<li>Strengthen the research capacity of the proposing active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardee to speed the entry of its innovation into the marketplace thereby improving the awardee's competitive position, and broadening its portfolio of marketable products through collaboration with an ERC.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both instances, the intent is to facilitate the translation of the knowledge gained from NSF's earlier technology investments into useful applications. The awardees create a mutually beneficial research and commercialization platform that joins ERCs and small business companies in this effort and establishes a model upon which the ERC and the firm can collaborate in the future.</p>
<p>Prospective fiscally viable small R&amp;D firms and active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardees should contact an ERC of interest, defined in the Appendix in Section X, to learn more about that center's scope of research, its membership agreement, the members of its Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and the research areas of interest of the center's researchers, and whether there is intellectual property available for translational research. Current information on ERCs can be found at

<p><strong>A self-sustaining, graduated ERC </strong>is defined as an ERC whose 10-year award period has expired, but which is financially self-sustaining and still retain ERC key features. Self-sustaining ERCs are from the Classes of 1990 or later (see the Appendix in Section X).   
</p>
<p><strong>An active SBIR/STTR awardee</strong> is one with an NSF Phase II award, which has not yet expired.</p>
<p>Given these definitions, proposals may only be submitted by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Any <em>Small Business Concern </em>proposing to either speed the translation of ERC generated technology into the marketplace or speed its implementation into a critical public service engineered system (the infrastructure). The firm may (or may not) be a current member of the ERC Industrial Advisory Board. (In Fastlane, submit the proposal to the EEC Division's ERC program). To be eligible for this award, the <em>Small Business Concern</em> must partner with either an <em>active</em>
<em>ERC awardee</em> or a <em>self-sustaining, graduated ERC</em> that participates in the collaborative research project and is a subawardee. In addition, the proposing firm must have obtained a license from the appropriate university for the ERC intellectual property associated with the proposed project before an award can be made.  
</li>
<li><strong>Option 2: 
</strong>Active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardees proposing to leverage ERC developed technology or know-how to strengthen the research capacity of the small business partner in the collaboration.

<p><strong>Important Proposal Preparation Information for Option 1 (full proposals): </strong>FastLane will check for required sections of the proposal, in accordance with <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG) instructions described in Chapter II.C.2. The GPG requires submission of: Project Summary; Project Description; References Cited; Biographical Sketch(es); Budget; Budget Justification; Current and Pending Support; Facilities, Equipment &amp; Other Resources; Data Management Plan; and Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan, if applicable. If a required section is missing, <strong>FastLane will not accept the proposal. </strong></p>
<p>Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions. If the solicitation instructions do not require a GPG-required section to be included in the proposal, insert text or upload a document in that section of the proposal that states, "Not Applicable for this Program Solicitation." Doing so will enable FastLane to accept your proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The fiscally viable small business, as the lead organization, must submit a single proposal that details the research responsibilities for both the small business and the ERC collaborator. (In Fastlane, submit the proposal to the EEC ERC program element 1480). The ERC collaborator must be designated as a subcontractor. The sub-awardee budget to the ERC collaborator must be a minimum of 30% or a maximum of 60% of the total award amount. The title of the proposal must start with "OPTION 1: Small-Business ERC Collaborative Opportunity for the <em>technical title</em>...". The proposal must state if the ERC partner is an active or graduated awardee. </p>
<p>1.   
<em>Project Summary:</em> The project summary consists of an overview and statements on the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of the proposed activity (one page limit).</p>
<p>2.   
<em>Project Description (15 page limit)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a. Vision and goals of the project:</em> Provide information on the project's vision, goals, and deliverables. Justify the vision in the context of a submission to Option 1. If the proposed project is aimed at supporting the <em>optional </em>demonstration of a portion of a platform technology framework that aligns with the ERC's long term strategic plan, the stated goals should indicate how the project will accomplish this. Non-platform technology submissions do not need to show alignment with the ERC strategic plan, but should clearly delineate the value proposition to the intended market segment or the impact on the intended critical public engineering project.</p>
<p><em>b. Justification of the proposed project</em>: Indicate how the proposed project derives from research carried out under the umbrella of the ERC's strategic plan during its NSF-supported phase and also include how the project furthers the ERC's strategic plan through translational research toward commercialization. (Note that the research may have been supported by (i) direct funding provided through the ERC's budget to the PI or (ii) sponsored project funds directed through the ERC. However, the research may not derive from associated project funding.) Justify how the proposed project aligns with the small business' current project portfolio and also strengthens the capacity of the small business concern to broaden its portfolio of marketable products. If the proposed project is in support of a critical public service infrastructure program, the emphasis of the narrative should be on the potential for high impact improvements to societal benefits rather than the commercialization impact.</p>
<p><em>c. Research plan: 
</em>The research plan must address the barriers to commercialization and include a strategy for overcoming them. Given the identified barriers, the research plan should describe the translational research or other research needed to explore commercialization of the technology and describe the test-beds. This section should also indicate how the project will be structured and executed specifying clearly the roles of the small business and ERC participants. Expected deliverables at the completion of the project should be specified and a milestone chart should be included indicating the time frame for addressing the technical and commercialization barriers. Optional platform technology framework only: justification of how the proposed project fits within the ERC's long term strategic plans aligning with a platform technology. Non-platform technology concepts should provide a stronger justification for how the proposal will move the concept toward market implementation.</p>
<p><em>d. Broader Impacts:</em> Please note, per guidance of GPG, the Project Description must contain as a separate section within the narrative a discussion of the broader impacts.</p>
<p><em>e. Student involvement:</em> Discuss how this project will provide ERC students at the graduate and/or undergraduate levels with essential experience to succeed in a competitive engineering, high-technology startup environment.</p>
<p><em>f. Management Plan:</em> This section should justify the choice for team members based on their expertise and in relation to the goals of the project. </p>
<p><em>g. Future Commercialization Plan:</em> Address the commercialization potential but do not write a full business plan.  If applicable include the expected impact of implementing the technology in support of critical public engine,ering projects (see the section on additional review criteria). Use this section to build a case for the expectation of success by benchmarking the proposed technology against the competition. Estimate the expected revenues over five years (include references that back up assumptions made in calculating revenue estimates). Estimate the timeline to commercialization, including how much it will cost to complete commercialization. For the latter, if more than $1 Million, describe a plan for developing the source of additional funding, and wherever possible, secure letters of support from strategic partners. It is important to include other useful information that helps the reviewers evaluate the viability of the small business collaborator such as: (i) the years of operation for the small business concern; (ii) any existing key revenue sources; (iii) any examples of prior commercialization successes; and (iv) the number of full time employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. <em>Budget:</em> Each partner organization must submit its own detailed budget and <em>all</em> line items in the budget must be justified. The budget should include travel for the small firm's PI and the ERC collaborator to attend a one-day workshop to be held in the Arlington, VA area. Because this is a continuing grant increment and the funds are apportioned between two performance periods, A and B, each partner organization must submit a separate budget for each increment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Proposals with 24 month performance periods, A+B that sum to 24 months. Half of the award funding will be released initially to fund Period A, and the remainder will be released after the NSF program director receives a satisfactory report on the first period of performance (see Section VII.C Reporting Requirements) to fund Period B; </li>
<li>Proposals with performance periods less than 24 months can be either 15 months or 18 months in duration. Awards for 12 month periods will not be allowed because the duration is too short to automatically trigger the second funding increment. In addition, the following rules also apply:
<ul>
<li>Period A is less than or equal to 12 months; Period B is less than or equal to 12 months; </li>
<li>The sum of the durations, A+B, equals either 15 or 18 months and will be indicated on the cover sheet; </li>
<li>Budget is prorated between the two performance periods; </li>
<li>The initial progress report is due one month before the end of performance period A. Performance period B will start as soon as the progress report is approved by both the ERC PI and the NSF PD. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>4. Biographical Sketches:</em> Per the Grant Proposal Guide, the biographical sketches must be submitted with two page maximum per person. A minimum of two biographical sketches must be submitted, one for the small firm Principal Investigator, and the other for the ERC subawardee.</p>
<p>5. 
<em>Supplementary Documents required for Option 1</em>: The following must be included with the proposal as supplementary documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li> Letter of endorsement from the company president or the CEO that indicates the value of the research partnership to the small business and also describes how the small business will contribute to the ERC. </li>
<li>Letter of endorsement from the ERC Center Director that describes the value of the research partnership to the ERC and </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o  
<em>for general proposals:</em> indicates whether the partnership facilitates any part of the ERC's center developed technology; </p>
<p>o  
<em>for the optional platform technology proposals only:</em> indicates how the proposed project fits within the ERCs strategic plan to develop a framework for a platform technology. The letter should also reference the pages in the ERC strategic plan that describes the platform framework. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Organization chart</em> of the small R&amp;D firm; </li>
<li><em>Optional platform technology</em> proposals only should provide a copy of the referenced section of the ERC strategic plan linking the proposed innovation to the plan, including the ERC's 3-plane strategic plan chart; </li>
<li><em>ERC lineage:</em> Documentation establishing ERC lineage of proposed innovation by providing copies of the Estimated Budgets by Research Thrust and Cluster in Table 2 of the ERC Annual Report during the years when the proposed innovation was developed; </li>
<li><em>Financial Conflicts of Interest (FCOI) Declaration:</em> The subawardee PI on this proposal must be an <strong>ERC participant</strong> and must submit a conflicts declaration, indicating whether or not he/she has a conflict with the submitting firm (as defined below). The definition of an<strong> ERC </strong><strong>participant</strong> includes the ERC's Director, Deputy Director, and other faculty from the lead and/or partner universities of the ERC who are carrying out research supported by the ERC's direct budget (core) funds, whether the ERC is currently funded by the NSF ERC Program or is self-sustaining. In addition, there are some members of the ERC Leadership Team who do not hold faculty appointments, but are nonetheless actively involved in the decision process for allocating ERC funds (e.g. Industrial Liaison Officers (ILO), ERC Executive Managers or Directors, Administrative Director, etc.). They are also considered <strong>ERC participants</strong> and as such must also disclose whether they have financial conflicts of interest with firms that are engaged with the ERC. Please note that Chapter IV, Section A.3 of the NSF Award Administration Guide (AAG) requires that "financial disclosures are updated during the period of the award, either on an annual basis, or as a new reportable significant financial interested". The following situations define <strong>Financial Conflict of Interest</strong> relationships that must be managed:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o  INCOME received by the ERC participant from the submitting firm, including, but not limited to, salary, consulting fees, honoraria, travel reimbursement, and income related to intellectual property rights and interests (patents, copyrights). </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o  EQUITY in the submitting firm received by the ERC participant, including, but not limited to, stock, stock options, stock purchase plan, incentive stock options, phantom stock, and stock appreciation rights. </p>
<p>o  POSITIONS in the submitting firm or in other entities affected by the proposed project, including, but not limited to, employee, consultant, founder, partner, board of directors, officer, trustee, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Scientific Advisory Board. </p>
<p>o  FINANCIAL interests in the submitting firm held by spouses and dependent children of the ERC participants.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Certification of FCOI Management Plan:</em> If the <strong>ERC participant</strong> in this project has significant financial conflict of interest in the submitting small business partner firm or other entities affected by the proposed project, the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) must certify that the university has on file a current copy of the FCOI management plan for the affected individual(s). For each of the ERC participants in the proposal who do not have a conflict of interest, the AOR should certify that there are no conflicts of interest.     
</li>
</ul>
<p>6. <em>Single copy document required for Option 1:</em> Documentation establishing financial viability of the firm as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Up-to-date Balance Sheet and Balance Sheet for the most recently completed fiscal year.</li>
<li>Indicate whether each Balance Sheet is audited, reviewed or compiled.</li>
<li>Calculate and clearly specify the following for each Balance Sheet:
<ul>
<li>Acid Test Ratio (Quick Ratio) = (Current Assets - Inventories -Prepayments)/Current Liabilities</li>
<li>Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities </li>
<li>Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After the calculation, if the ratios are low (less than 1.0), please provide additional documents such as funding commitments, letters of support or investor interest, statements showing deferment of repayment of current debts etc, which would show that the firm has enough financial resources to carry out the grant activities. Prepare the requested financial information into a single PDF document labeled "Financial Viability Information" and upload into Fastlane under "single copy document". DO NOT UPLOAD UNDER SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS.</p>
<p><em>After programmatic review, all prospective new awardees will undergo a comprehensive administrative and financial review as outlined in the Prospective New Awardee Guide (</em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pnag"><em>https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pnag</em></a>
<em>).</em></p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> The active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II company will submit a request for supplemental funding to the original Phase II award via FastLane. The ERC grantee will be a subcontractor. If the grantee is an active NSF STTR Phase II company, the sub-awardee budget to the ERC must be a minimum of 30% or a maximum of 60% of the total award amount. If the grantee is an active NSF SBIR Phase II company, the sub-awardee budget to the ERC must not exceed 50% of the total award amount. The title of the proposal must start with "ERC - Small Business:" The proposal must state if the ERC is an active or a graduated awardee. </p>
<p>1.<em> Summary of Proposed Work (15 page limit): 
</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.<em>Vision and goals of the project:</em> Provide information on the project's vision, goals, and deliverables. Justify the vision in the context of a submission to Option 2.</p>
<p>b. <em>Research Plan:</em> Rationale for collaboration including tasks to be performed: Research plan should address barriers to commercialization and propose a strategy for overcoming them. Given the barriers, the research plan should describe the additional research needed to explore commercialization of the technology, indicate how the project will be structured and executed, and specify the roles of the small business and ERC participants.

VI. NSF Proposal Processing and Review Procedures
</h3>
<p> Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
<p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at:
<a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
<p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   
</p>
<p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives. 
</p>
<p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. 
</p>
<p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
<p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
 
</li>
<li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
 
</li>
<li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
<p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
<p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>
contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
<p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
 
</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
<ol>
<li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
<li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
<li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
<li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
<li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
</ol>
<p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
<p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<h4>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter.

<h4>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at

<p><strong>Option 1.</strong> To ensure strong coordination between the small business concern and the ERC collaborator,<strong> </strong> the Option1 award will be set up as a fixed amount award with the funds are apportioned between two performance periods, A and B, which are defined as follows. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposals with 24 month performance periods, A+B that sum to 24 months. Half of the award funding will be released initially to fund Period A, and the remainder will be released after the NSF program director receives a satisfactory report on the first period of performance (see Section VII.C Reporting Requirements) to fund Period B; </li>
<li>Proposals with performance periods less than 24 months can be either 15 months or 18 months in duration. Awards for 12 month periods will not be allowed because the duration is too short to automatically trigger the second funding increment. In addition, the following rules also apply:<br />
<ul>
<li>Period A is less than or equal to 12 months; Period B is less than or equal to 12 months;</li>
<li>
<p>The sum of the durations, A+B, equals either 15 or 18 months and will be indicated on the cover sheet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Budget is prorated between the two performance periods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial progress report is due one month before the end of performance period A. Performance period B will start as soon as the progress report is approved by both the ERC PI and the NSF PD. </p></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>As the recipient of a continuing grant increment, to receive the remaining funds, the small business PI must submit an integrated progress report, limited to 10 pages, that encompasses contributions by both the small business concern and the ERC research collaborators </blockquote>
<p>This report must be submitted, via email, to the ERC faculty collaborator and the NSF ERC Program Director. If the progress report is satisfactory to both the ERC faculty collaborator and the NSF ERC PD, the remaining funds will be awarded. In addition, the ERC faculty collaborator will submit the reports received from the small business PI for inclusion in Volume II of the ERC's annual report. The small business PI should note that submission of this report is <em>in addition to, not in lieu of </em>the standard NSF requirement that an annual and final report be submitted into Fastlane. </p>
<p>The final report must summarize the contributions by both the small business and ERC researchers over the award period.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2. 
</strong>Plans for monitoring and assessment may include such elements as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-annual reports from NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II firms;</li>
<li>Annual Grantee Conference</li>
<li>Post-award monitoring through site visits to NSF PhaseII firms;</li>
<li>External evaluation<strong> </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The final report must summarize the contributions by both the small business and ERC researchers over the award period.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.
