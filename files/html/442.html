        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>This solicitation aims at introducing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through a variety of interdisciplinary approaches into undergraduate engineering education. The focus of the FY 2014 competition is on nanoscale engineering education with relevance to devices and systems and/or on the societal, ethical, economic and/or environmental issues relevant to nanotechnology.</p>
            <p>A well-prepared, innovative science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is crucial to the Nation's health and economy. Indeed, recent policy actions and reports have drawn attention to the opportunities and challenges inherent in increasing the number of highly qualified STEM graduates, including STEM teachers. Priorities include educating students to be leaders and innovators in emerging and rapidly changing STEM fields as well as educating a scientifically literate populace; both of these priorities depend on the nature and quality of the undergraduate education experience. In addressing these STEM challenges and priorities, the National Science Foundation invests in research-based and research-generating approaches to understanding STEM learning; to designing, testing, and studying curricular change; to wide dissemination and implementation of best practices; and to broadening participation of individuals and institutions in STEM fields. The goals of these investments include: increasing student retention in STEM, to prepare students well to participate in science for tomorrow, and to improve students' STEM learning outcomes.</p>
            <p>Recognizing disciplinary differences and priorities, NSF's investment in research and development in undergraduate STEM education encompasses a range of approaches. These approaches include: experiential learning, assessment/metrics of learning and practice, scholarships, foundational education research, professional development/institutional change, formal and informal learning environments, and undergraduate disciplinary research. Both individually and integrated in a range of combinations, these approaches can lead to outcomes including: developing the STEM and STEM-related workforce, advancing science, broadening participation in STEM, educating a STEM-literate populace, improving K-12 STEM education, encouraging life-long learning, and building capacity in higher education.</p>
            <p>Related funding opportunities are posted on the web site for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nano">https://www.nsf.gov/nano</a>  In addition, research and education projects in nanoscale science and engineering will continue to be supported in the relevant NSF programs and divisions. </p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>One nanometer (one billionth of a meter) is a magical point on the dimensional scale. Nanostructures are at the confluence of the smallest of human-made devices and the largest molecules of living systems known today. Nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) here refers to the fundamental understanding and resulting technological advances arising from the exploitation of new physical, chemical, and biological properties of systems that are intermediate in size, between isolated atoms and molecules and bulk materials, where the transitional properties between the two limits can be controlled. During the last few years, novel structures, phenomena, and processes have been observed at the nanoscale (from a fraction of a nanometer to about 100 nm) and new experimental, theoretical, and simulation tools have been developed for investigating them. These advances provide exciting opportunities for scientific and technological developments in nanoparticles, nanostructure materials, nanodevices, and systems. </p>
          <p>Nanotechnology is the creation and utilization of functional materials, devices, and systems with novel properties and functions that are achieved through the control and restructuring of matter at the atomic, molecular and macromolecular levels. A revolution has begun in science, engineering, and technology based on the ability to organize, characterize, and manipulate matter systematically at the nanoscale. Far-reaching outcomes for the 21st century are envisioned in both scientific knowledge and a wide range of technologies in most industries, healthcare, conservation of materials and energy, biology, environment, and education. Fundamental research in NSE underpins innovation in critical areas ranging from manufacturing to medicine.</p>
          <p>NSE has technological, economic, environmental, social, and ethical dimensions that may change the world in which we live. Increased understanding and appreciation of the potential for nanoscale science and engineering will be needed to create an informed citizenry and a competitive workforce.</p>
          <p>The Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program aims to integrate advancements in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology into the undergraduate engineering curricula. The NUE in Engineering program provides funding for projects that will address the educational challenges of these emerging fields and generate practical ways of introducing nanotechnology into undergraduate engineering education with a focus on devices and systems and/or on social, economic, and ethical issues relevant to nanotechnology. Given the worldwide expansion of research and education in NSE, international collaborations that advance underlying NSE education goals and strengthen U.S. activities are encouraged.</p>
          
      
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
<p>Program Goals</p>
          <p>Advances in nanotechnology research provide new opportunities in undergraduate education. With its focus on imaging and manipulating the atom, the ultimate building block of matter, nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) provides a multitude of new interdisciplinary teaching opportunities for engaging interest and for broadening vision by students of science, engineering, and technology. NSE thus permits new strategies for enhancing science and engineering literacy, preparing the workforce for emerging technologies, and attracting a diverse group of talented students to the workforce of tomorrow. The FY 2014 solicitation is focused on nanoscale engineering education with relevance to devices and systems, and/or on the societal, ethical, economic and/or environmental  issues relevant to nanotechnology.</p>
          <p>NUE in Engineering provides opportunities for invigorating undergraduate engineering education through creative new courses and research experiences. It blends engineering, chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, materials science, geology, behavioral and social sciences, and design.  As such, it provides new opportunities for faculty collaboration, both in teaching and in research, that cross traditional disciplinary and departmental boundaries. Some examples of nanotechnology-based topics that can be introduced into the curriculum include scanning probe methods, devices using nanotubes, bottom-up and top-down syntheses of nanoscale materials, self-assembly, nanobiotechnology, environmental aspects of nanotechnology, applications of nanotechnology to information technology, properties and fundamental phenomena in nanoscale materials, computational methods for modeling nanoscale materials, nanoscale devices, nanoscale systems, design principles at nanoscale, and the societal, ethical, economic and environmental implications of nanotechnology. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nano">https://www.nsf.gov/nano</a> for additional examples.</p>
          <p>NUE in Engineering projects are intended to enable individuals, departments, programs, or campuses to integrate research advancements into their curricula. Integration could take the form of a new course or courses, or modification of existing courses such that a substantial portion of the course content is based on nanoscale engineering. Integration could include a module or modules in courses that focus on issues of environmental or social change and new developments in nanoscale engineering, or a new course or series of courses that include those focus areas. The projects should be evidenced-based and grounded in what is known about student learning.  Proposals involving any part of the undergraduate engineering curriculum are eligible. International collaborations that advance the underlying NUE in Engineering goals and strengthen U.S. activities are encouraged.</p>
          <p>Project Characteristics</p>
          <p>NUE in Engineering emphasizes new approaches to undergraduate engineering education through interdisciplinary collaborations. These collaborations could lead to, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A freshman course introducing the basic phenomena and processes at the nanoscale, the unifying principle of matter at the nanoscale, connections to other disciplines, and application areas of societal relevance;</li>
            <li>New examples of undergraduate nanoscale engineering courses that are presented through the development of laboratory and demonstration experiments, manuals and other written materials, software, and web-based resources;</li>
            <li>Development and dissemination of new teaching modules for nanoscale engineering of relevance to engineering education that can be used in existing undergraduate courses;</li>
            <li>Incorporation of undergraduate research opportunities in nanoscale engineering into the curriculum at any level; and</li>
            <li>Development of courses or curricular enhancements related to nanoscale engineering and technology and environmental or social change.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The NUE is the only solicitation focused on NSE as part of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).  </p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to the above, the following elements will be used by reviewers and NSF staff in evaluating all NUE in Engineering proposals:
        <ul>
          <li>Does the proposal focus on nanoscale engineering education with relevance to devices and systems and/or on the societal, ethical, economic and/or environmental issues relevant to nanotechnology?</li>
          <li>Are the goals and measurable expected outcomes defined and are they appropriate to the scope, scale, and state of the project?</li>
          <li>Does the proposal describe a convincing rationale and appropriate methods that are grounded in the engineering education knowledge base?</li>

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       

        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
