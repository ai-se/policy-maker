<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>FastLane
Announcement #01-02</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This announcement discusses several
recent changes to the FastLane system including implementation of the common
Principal Investigator/co-Principal Investigator login, changes to the
login for panelist travel, the removal of the "other" option under Notification
and Requests, and expansion of the FastLane Help Desk.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Implementation of PI/co-PI Login</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As part of our user-friendly changes (e.g.
allowing documents to be uploaded in other formats, making detailed documentation
available to users and expanding the FastLane Help Desk), FastLane has
developed a common login for Principal Investigators (PIs), co-Principal
Investigators and other authorized users. This essentially reduces the
ten separate logins down to two: one for PIs/Co-PIs and one for other authorized
users.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PIs no longer need to remember their proposal
ID or award ID numbers to work on project reports, other post-award functions
or check on proposal status. Instead, a list of active proposals and awards,
with titles, will be shown.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Panelist Login</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">FastLane has changed the login requirements
for the Panelist Travel System to be the same as for other panelist functions
(panel ID, last name and password). Panelists no longer will need to know
their reviewer IDs to log into panel functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later this
year, FastLane will implement a common panelist login allowing panelists
a single place to perform all their required functions.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Notifications and Requests</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">FastLane has removed the "other" button,
previously used for supplemental funding requests, under Notifications
and Requests (a notice about this has existed under Notifications and Requests
for the past three months).&nbsp;&nbsp; As explained on the Notification
and Request page, PIs writing an award supplement should be using the Supplemental
Funding Request module.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>FastLane Help Desk</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The FastLane Help Desk hours will be
expanded starting in May from 8 A.M to 6 P.M. Eastern Time, currently,&nbsp;
to 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. Eastern Time during normal business days.</font></font>
