          IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES
        </h3>
         
          <p>The <strong>E</strong>nabling <strong>D</strong>iscovery through <strong>GE</strong>nomic Tools (EDGE) track, a component of the previous IOS Core solicitation (NSF 16-505) has been removed and will be announced in a separate solicitation forthcoming in late 2016.</p>
          <p>Proposals focused on plant-microbial symbioses of all types formerly accepted for review in the Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-recognition Program in the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster of IOS <strong>are no longer accepted into this solicitation</strong>.  Proposals on plant-microbial symbioses are accepted for review by the Plant Biotic Interactions program (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505267&amp;org=IOS&amp;sel_org=IOS&amp;from=fund">NSF 16-551</a>), supported and managed by NSF IOS and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).</p>
          <p>This solicitation includes information about international collaborative research opportunities with the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation as described in a recent IOS Dear Colleague Letter (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15090/nsf15090.jsp">nsf15090</a>).</p>
          <p>Biographical sketches submitted with preliminary and full proposals in response to this solicitation must now conform to the Biosketch guidelines of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG).</p>
          <p><strong>Important Reminders</strong></p>
          <p>The Division of Integrative Organismal Systems continues an annual cycle of preliminary and full proposal merit review in the core programs. Preliminary proposals will be accepted in January and binding decisions will be made to invite or not invite full proposals for submission in August. The core programs do not accept full proposals without invitation; exceptions are [1] proposals submitted in response to the CAREER, Research Coordination Network, Plant Genome Research Program, Basic Research to Enable Agricultural Development, EDGE, or Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant solicitations; or [2] special proposals that are described in the Grant Proposal Guide, e.g., Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), EArly Concept Grants for Exploratory research (EAGER), conference proposals, and requests for supplemental funding. Full proposals received in response to this solicitation that were not invited will be returned without review (except as noted under Additional Funding Opportunities).</p>
          <p>Unsolicited full research proposals are no longer accepted into the IOS Core Programs.</p>
          <p>Post-award requests for supplemental funding should only be made for unanticipated opportunities that arise after an award is made.</p>
          <p><strong>Important Information about Proposal Submission</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong>Preliminary Proposals </strong>submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide </em>(PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16001">NSF 16-1</a>).</p>
          <p><strong>Invited Full Proposals </strong> submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised NSF PAPPG (NSF 17-1). NSF anticipates release of the PAPPG in the Fall of 2016 and it will be effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 30, 2017.</p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) supports research aimed at understanding why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do. Proposals should focus on organisms as a fundamental unit of biological organization. Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to apply systems approaches that will lead to conceptual and theoretical insights and predictions about emergent organismal properties. Areas of inquiry include, but are not limited to, developmental biology and the evolution of developmental processes, nervous system development, structure, and function, physiological processes, functional morphology, symbioses, interactions of organisms with biotic and abiotic environments, and animal behavior.</p>
            <p>Proposals are welcomed in all of the core scientific program areas supported by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.  All investigator-initiated proposals submitted to this solicitation must be invited based on merit review of preliminary proposals. There is a single submission deadline with a limit of 2 preliminary proposals per investigator per year as PI or Co-PI in response to this solicitation. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">Please see the PAPPG for definition of roles for PI and Co-PI.</a> The PI/Co-PI limits apply only to the preliminary proposals submitted to this solicitation and do not pertain to proposals submitted in response to other IOS or NSF solicitations.</p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or Co-PI:</strong> 2</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The number of proposals per PI or co-PI is 2.</p>
          <p>In a given year, an individual may participate as a PI or co-PI on no more than two preliminary proposals submitted to the Core track in response to this IOS Core Program Solicitation. Preliminary proposals in excess of the limit for any person will be returned without review in the reverse order received.</p>
          <p>"<strong>PI</strong>" and "<strong>co-PI</strong>" refer to the role an individual would play in a full proposal (including all parts of a Collaborative Research Proposal). See Exhibit II-7: Definitions of Categories of Personnel in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">PAPPG</a> for the definition of proposer roles. It is the responsibility of the submitters to confirm that the entire team is within the eligibility guidelines. Participating in a proposal as a lead investigator on a sub-award, other senior personnel or as a collaborator does not count towards this limit, including investigators who contribute services for a fee (e.g., sequencing). Thus, the number of proposals on which an investigator can be listed as collaborator is unlimited. Changes in the team post-submission to meet the eligibility limits will not be allowed.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of this solicitation senior personnel include the Principal Investigator (PI), any co-PIs, and any other researchers actively involved in achieving and managing the intellectual merit or broader impacts goals of the project. Senior personnel may include individuals who will provide essential expertise and intellectual engagement in a small but significant component of the overall project. Named postdoctoral researchers may be considered senior personnel. Students, or collaborators and consultants who provide specific technical expertise on a limited portion of the project are not considered senior personnel.</p>
          <p>This limit does not pertain to proposals submitted to other solicitations (e.g., EDGE, Research Coordination Networks, Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants, CAREER, Plant Genome Research Program, Basic Research to Enable Agricultural Development) or to core programs in other BIO Divisions (Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Biological Infrastructure, Environmental Biology). However, solicitations may have their own limit guidelines so be sure to review those carefully for details.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>IOS supports research aimed at improving our understanding of organisms as integrated units of biological organization.  The Division welcomes diverse approaches to research addressing organismal questions, and especially encourages integrative and interdisciplinary perspectives on complex problems in organismal biology. The goal is to predict why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do.  Projects that innovatively apply approaches that combine experimentation, computation, and modeling, and which lead to new conceptual and theoretical insights and testable predictions about integrated organismal properties, including the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes or genomes and phenomes are particularly encouraged.  Research that integrates data across spatial/temporal/biological scales, leads to transformative methods, tools and resources, and/or seeks breakthroughs in the areas of phenotypic plasticity and organismal resilience will be given high priority for funding throughout the division. <strong><em>However, research motivated by relevance to human health or addressing the mechanisms of human disease is not appropriate for the Division and will be returned without review.</em></strong></p>
          <p>IOS continues to support projects that provide unique educational and training opportunities for the next generation of researchers, scientific educators and scientifically literate citizens. In order to address the Broader Impacts review criterion, proposals can contain the development of innovative educational, broadening participation, and outreach activities or substantive participation in existing institutional infrastructure for education, training and outreach. Successful proposals often demonstrate close integration of the scientific and educational goals. </p>
          <p>The Division will continue to support projects addressing any of these opportunities across the full range of conceptual scales, and time (1-5 years) with associated budget requests for support that are commensurate with the scope and scale of the work. The Division recognizes the interest of the scientific community in projects that are smaller in scope, potentially shorter in duration, and that require relatively modest support compared to the present norm. Therefore, the Division reminds proposers that it will continue to support small-scale projects.</p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Proposals are welcomed in all of the core scientific program areas supported by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, including projects that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. The core scientific programs in IOS are organized into four clusters. Click on the cluster name to go to the cluster web page to learn more about each cluster.</p>
          <p>After reading the cluster and program descriptions, discuss any questions about the potential fit of a project to one of the clusters with the Program Director you believe is most closely associated with your field of interest. <em>Biological questions, rather than techniques or approaches, should guide program selection.</em></p>
          <p>Please consult the IOS web page (<a title="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS" href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS</a>) for information about Program Directors associated with each programmatic area. This interaction can be a critical aspect for ensuring that your proposal is assigned to the most appropriate program for review.</p>
          <p>The core scientific programs in IOS are organized into four clusters:</p>
          <p><a title="Behavioral Systems Cluster" href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504676&amp;org=IOS&amp;from=home" target="_blank">Behavioral Systems Cluster</a></p>
          <p>The Behavioral Systems Cluster consists of the Animal Behavior Program and the Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant program (DDIG). Only the Animal Behavior Program is part of the IOS Core Programs Solicitation.</p>
          <p><a title="Developmental Systems Cluster" href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504677&amp;org=IOS&amp;from=home" target="_blank">Developmental Systems Cluster</a></p>
          <p>Programs within the Developmental Systems Cluster are: the Plant, Fungal and Microbial Developmental Mechanisms Program, the Animal Developmental Mechanisms Program and the Evolution of Developmental Mechanisms Program.</p>
          <p><a title="Neural Systems Cluster" href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504678&amp;org=IOS&amp;from=home" target="_blank">Neural Systems Cluster</a> </p>
          <p>Programs within the Neural Systems Cluster are the Organization Program, the Activation Program and the Modulation Program.</p>
          <p><a title="PSS Cluster" href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504679&amp;org=IOS&amp;from=home" target="_blank">Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster</a></p>
          <p> Programs within the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster are: the Symbiosis, Defense and Self-recognition Program (SDS), the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program (PMB), and the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program (IEP). <strong>Note: Proposals focused on plant-microbial symbioses of all types that were formerly accepted for review in the SDS Program in response to the Core Programs solicitation will not be accepted for review in this solicitation. Proposals in this area of research should be submitted to the Plant Biotic Interactions solicitation (NSF 16-551), jointly managed by NSF/IOS and USDA NIFA.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Please note that you must select a program name on the FastLane cover page during submission.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>REVIEW PROCESS </strong></p>
          <p>A two-stage review process is used for applications to the IOS core programs, including RUI proposals:</p>
          <p><strong><em>Preliminary Proposals:</em></strong> All proposers <strong>must </strong>submit a preliminary proposal that outlines the major goals of the project including the components described below. Preliminary proposals will typically be reviewed by a panel of outside experts. The Program Directors will communicate the decision to Invite/Not Invite full proposals <em>via</em> FastLane and these decisions will be based on the panel recommendations and additional portfolio considerations. Invite/Do Not invite decisions are binding.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Full Proposals:</em></strong> <em>Invited</em> full proposals will receive <em>ad hoc </em>and/or panel review at the discretion of the Program, as described in Section VI of this Solicitation. Full proposals that were <em>not invited</em> at the Preliminary Proposal stage (except as noted for RCN, CAREER and ABR) will be returned without review.</p>
          <p> <em><strong>Special Information for:</strong></em></p>
          <p>Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) Proposals</p>
          <p>Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) proposals may be submitted in response to this solicitation. RUI submissions must start with a preliminary proposal. The preliminary proposal must be received by the deadline listed in this solicitation. Information on the scope of RUI projects and the format of these proposals can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5518&amp;from=fund">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5518&amp;from=fund</a>.</p>
          <p>Research Coordination Network (RCN) Proposals</p>
          <p>This solicitation will accept Research Coordination Network (RCN) Proposals. RCN proposals do not start with a preliminary proposal and instead should be submitted at the deadline for the Core track invited full proposals listed in this solicitation. Information on the scope of RCN projects and the format of these proposals can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11691">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11691</a>.</p>
          <p>Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR) Proposals</p>
          <p>This solicitation will accept Accomplishment Based Renewal Proposals. ABR proposals do not start with a preliminary proposal and instead should be submitted at the deadline for invited full proposals listed in this IOS solicitation. Information on eligibility and the scope and format for ABR submissions can be found in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">PAPPG</a>. If you are considering an ABR submission you <strong>MUST</strong> contact a program officer in the relevant cluster prior to submission. Failure to do so may result in your proposal being returned without review.</p>
          <p>U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) Collaborative Proposals</p>
          <p>Proposals for international research in accordance with the IOS Dear Colleague Letter that announced this international collaborative activity with the BSF (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15090/nsf15090.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15090/nsf15090.jsp</a>) will be accepted under this solicitation. These international collaborative proposal submissions (whether reviewed by NSF or the international partner) will be subject to the submission limits in this solicitation for any PI or Co-PI. The preliminary proposal must be received by the deadlines listed in this solicitation. Questions about this activity should be directed to <a href="mailto:NSF-IOS-BSF@nsf.gov">NSF-IOS-BSF@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES </strong></p>
          <p>This solicitation does not apply to conference proposals, requests for supplemental funding, RAPID or EAGER proposals, all of which should be submitted following the standard guidelines outlined below by selecting "In response to GPG" on the proposal coversheet and then selecting the appropriate Type of Proposal from the pull-down menu. CAREER proposals are likewise not covered by this solicitation. Additional CAREER proposal information can be found here: <a title="CAREER Program Page" href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214" target="_blank">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214</a></p>
          <p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>
          <p>IOS supports conferences, symposia, and workshops in areas of science supported by IOS that bring experts together to discuss current research, to expose other researchers or students to new research methods, and to discuss future directions. Conferences will be supported only if equivalent results cannot be obtained at regular meetings of professional societies or established conference series. For Guidance on preparing proposals for Conferences visit <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bio/ios/confworkshopguidance.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bio/ios/confworkshopguidance.jsp</a>. Proposers are encouraged to contact a Program Director about the suitability of the proposed activity for IOS support prior to submission.</p>
          <p><strong>EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER)</strong></p>
          <p>The EAGER type of proposal may be used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This work may be considered especially "high risk-high payoff" in the sense that it, for example, involves radically different approaches, applies new expertise, or engages novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives. These exploratory proposals may also be submitted directly to an NSF program at any time, but the EAGER mechanism should <strong>not</strong> be used for projects that are appropriate for submission as "regular" (i.e., non-EAGER) NSF proposals. PI(s) <strong>must</strong> contact the NSF Program Director(s) whose expertise is most germane to the proposal topic prior to submission of an EAGER proposal. This will aid in determining the appropriateness of the work for consideration under the EAGER mechanism; this suitability must be assessed early in the process. For guidelines, see the most recent version of the NSF PAPPG (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp</a>). </p>
          <p><strong>Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID)</strong></p>
          <p>The RAPID type of proposal is used for proposals having a severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to, data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events. PI(s) must contact the NSF Program Director(s) whose expertise is most germane to the proposal topic before submitting a RAPID proposal. This will facilitate determining whether the proposed work is appropriate for RAPID funding. For guidelines, see the most recent version of the NSF PAPPG (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp</a>). </p>
          <p><strong>Supplemental Funding Requests</strong></p>
          <p>The target date for most IOS programs for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), Research Assistantships for High School Students (RAHSS), and Research Opportunity Award (ROA) supplement requests as well as proposals for Conferences is <strong>March 1</strong> annually (or next business day if that is a weekend or holiday). See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bio/supp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bio/supp.jsp</a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS</a> for guidance on preparation of requests for supplemental funding.</p>
          <p><strong>Please note that supplemental funding is intended for unanticipated opportunities</strong> <strong>only and should be justified on this basis</strong>. Requests for support of planned REU, RET, RAHSS, and ROA activities should be included in the invited full proposal budget. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;org=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;org=IOS</a> for additional guidance on budget preparation.</p>
          <p><strong>Career Life Balance Supplements</strong></p>
          <p>The Division will continue to support Career Life Balance (CLB) supplements. Instituted in 2012, NSF&rsquo;s Career-Life Balance (CLB) Initiative is an ambitious, ten-year initiative that will build on the best of family-friendly practices among individual NSF programs to expand them to activities NSF-wide.</p>
          <p>Funded Principal Investigators (PIs) are invited to submit supplemental funding requests to support additional personnel (e.g., research technicians or equivalent) to sustain research when the PI is on family leave. These requests may include funding for up to 3 months of salary support, for a maximum of $12,000 in salary compensation. The fringe benefits and associated indirect costs may be in addition to the salary payment and therefore, the total supplemental funding request may exceed $12,000.</p>
          <p><strong>International Activities</strong></p>
          <p>Investigators may also include international components in new proposals submitted to any relevant NSF program, or request <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/documents/sfr/sfr.jsp">supplemental funding</a> for projects already supported by NSF. Investigators should consult early in the proposal process with both the disciplinary program manager and the <a title="International Science and Engineering Section" href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/index.jsp" target="_blank">International Science and Engineering</a> (ISE) country program manager. ISE works with all NSF areas to co-fund new awards and supplements that meet these criteria. Information about additional international funding opportunities and links to ISE country program manager contacts may be found at <a title="ISE Section Page" href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/index.jsp" target="_blank">https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/index.jsp</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>INVITED PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
        <p>Full proposals will be accepted only from PIs who have submitted preliminary proposals in the current review cycle and have been invited to submit a full proposal, except as noted under Additional Funding Opportunities.</p>
        <p>The full proposal should not deviate substantially from the preliminary proposal in the scope of the project or the list of personnel without prior written approval of the managing Program Director. However, PIs should consider incorporating useful suggestions from the reviews and panel summary of the preliminary proposal merit review. PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss such changes to scope, project plan and personnel with the managing Program Director prior to submitting a full proposal incorporating such changes.</p>
        <p><strong>The invited full proposal must be submitted to this Program Solicitation (not the PAPPG) and the Program area to which the Preliminary Proposal was submitted should be selected from the pull-down menu.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>ADDITIONAL FULL PROPOSAL PREPARATION GUIDANCE</strong></p>
        <p>The PAPPG now states that the Project Description, must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled "Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work". This separate section must be included in the Project Description of full proposals submitted to the IOS Core Programs solicitation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <strong>Research Experiences. </strong>Projects anticipating the inclusion of REU, RET, RAHSS, or ROA activities should include those as part of the research proposal itself. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;org=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;org=IOS</a> for additional information about preparation of REU budget requests. Please note that supplemental funding is intended only for unanticipated opportunities that arise during the course of the project.</li></ul>
        <p>For REU activities, a <strong>Supplementary Document</strong> (limited to three pages) should be included that describes (1) the nature of each prospective student's involvement in the research project; (2) the experience of the PI (or other prospective research mentors); (3) the nature of the mentoring that the student(s) will receive; and (4) the process and criteria for selecting the students(s). If a student has been selected, the grounds for selection and a brief biographical sketch of the student should be included. Please note that this section should not include a project description. See: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13542/nsf13542.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13542/nsf13542.pdf</a> for additional guidance.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
     
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to

              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>For preliminary proposals, it is recommended that reviewers focus on the following critical aspects of the proposed work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The questions driving the research</li>
          <li>The goals expected to be accomplished</li>
          <li>The approaches employed in the proposed research</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, it is suggested that the following issues be considered as they prepare their reviews: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are the ideas innovative or potentially transformative?</li>
          <li>Are the ideas conceptually well grounded?</li>
          <li>Are the experimental approaches and experimental design feasible and logically linked to the central ideas?</li>
          <li>Are the PIs well qualified and sufficiently experienced with the approaches to effectively conduct the research?</li>
          <li>What risks are involved and can they be overcome?</li>
          <li>What is the potential impact of the science?</li>
          <li>Is there a convincing and significant effort made towards broader impacts?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A strong preliminary proposal is one in which the logical flow and significance of the proposed line of investigation are articulated clearly and the broader impacts of the work are apparent. In short, IOS would like reviewers to identify preliminary proposals that address questions and/or ideas that are most likely to lead to large advances in the field.</p>

         <h4>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

        <h4>
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
