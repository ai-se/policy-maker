         I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Plants are of fundamental importance to society and are the basis of our carbon economy. Over the years, research in plant genomics has provided unprecedented access to the knowledge and capabilities needed to address challenging biological questions of societal importance. The promise of plant genomics is that the discoveries from basic research will contribute to solving pressing global problems. This will be accomplished by continuing to uncover fundamental biological principles and by developing the tools and resources to do so. Under the guidance of the National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI), the PGRP supports research that provides essential upstream information that will ultimately bridge to practical outcomes. Established in 1998, the NPGI has provided a series of five-year strategic plans that have steered advances in plant genomics from basic research to effective outcomes by coordinating action across federal agencies. The NPGI and the PGRP are currently guided by the fourth of these strategic plans (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf</a>).</p>
          <p>The overarching goals of the PGRP are: (1) to support cutting edge research that investigates the structure and function of the genomes of economically important plants, including biological processes and biotic/abiotic interactions of societal importance, (2) to further the development of innovative tools, technologies and resources that drive genomics research, (3) to promote the integration, accessibility and analysis of genome-wide datasets, and (4) to promote the development of human resources in plant genomics and stimulate full engagement of all sectors in scientific achievement, training and communication.</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) supports genome-scale research that frames questions at the frontier of plant biology and of importance to society. Combined with technology breakthroughs, plant genomics research continues to develop critical tools and resources in economically important plants. Significant questions can be addressed about how plant genomes function independently and together with other genomes, in response to the environment, and across scales. At the same time, new data challenges are emerging and assimilation of diverse data sets into a comprehensive framework is needed. There thus remains a pressing need to refine the questions and generate the tools, resources and capabilities to advance knowledge and produce outcomes that will revolutionize agriculture, address fundamental issues of climate change and build a scientifically engaged population. </p>
          <p>The PGRP invites proposals that focus on basic research and tool development in economically important plants. Targeted challenge grant opportunities are available to stimulate breakthroughs in plant transformation capabilities and to expand information access by mining and reusing existing datasets. The Program promotes training and career advancement in plant genomics by supporting early and mid-career investigators. Proposals are encouraged in the following four major areas:</p>
          <p><strong><em>Genome-scale research and/or tool development (RESEARCH-PGR):  </em></strong><em>To tackle questions in plant biology on a genome-wide scale and develop the tools and resources that enable discovery.</em></p>
          <p>The PGRP continues to support projects that emphasize hypothesis-driven research and/or tool and resource development on a genome-wide scale. Proposals should be innovative and explore new scientific territory, and should articulate the problem, question, hypothesis, or grand challenge of the genomics-related topics. Especially encouraged are proposals that address challenging questions that can be tackled afresh using genome-wide, large-scale methods. Proposals that focus on generating new tools or community resources are encouraged. Examples of areas for research and tool development are provided here:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><em>Genome by Genome Interactions</em>: Plant genomes function in coordination with multiple other genomes including those of microbes, invertebrates, fungi, other plants and within cells. Research emphases should be on responses and interactions from the host plant perspective.</li>
            <li><em>Genomes by Epigenomes by Environment Interactions:</em> Plants are responsive to their environment at multiple time and spatial scales. Basic research is needed to identify mechanisms of interaction, resilience to climate change and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants of societal importance on a genome-wide scale.</li>
            <li><em>Genotype to Phenotype: </em>Gaps exist in understanding how plants process and assimilate genomic and epigenomic information, within the context of physiology, biochemistry, growth and development, to produce an integrated phenome. Research that embraces holistic approaches is especially encouraged.</li>
            <li><em>High-throughput Phenotyping: </em>Connecting genotypes to phenotypes will be accelerated by advances in throughput and automation of phenotyping, especially under field conditions and over time. Connecting and integrating these data outputs to underlying sequence information is essential.</li>
            <li><em>Breakthrough </em><em>Technologies:</em> Novel ideas and exploratory technologies revolutionize the ability to answer challenging questions in plant genomics. Potent breakthrough technologies that advance research in plant genomics are welcome.</li>
            <li><em>Data Challenges:</em> New approaches are needed to address remaining challenges in data generation, analytics and management. These include developing frameworks for harmonizing, coordinating, producing, archiving or discarding, analyzing and optimizing the datasets produced. Novel approaches to addressing data challenges are encouraged.</li>
            <li><em>Visualization</em>: New methods are needed to improve data visualization across scales and are essential for functional genomics and for advancing the interpretation and accessibility of genomics datasets.</li>
            <li><em>Bridging Partnerships</em>: The expansion and conversion of basic knowledge to studies in fields and diverse environments is a key step in translating basic discovery to practical application. Proposals are encouraged that build bridges between basic research and practical application by partnering with agriculturally oriented researchers, plant breeders or researchers from other disciplines.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>Plant Transformation Challenge Grants (TRANSFORM-PGR): </em></strong><em>Technology challenge to advance plant transformation capabilities.</em></p>
          <p>Plant transformation is a critical tool for functional genomics and for realizing the powerful potential of genome editing and synthetic biology. Advances in plant transformation have stalled in recent decades, in part due to seemingly intractable bottlenecks that vary with crop or plant species. New creative, collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed to overcome these existing challenges and to catapult transformation capabilities to a new level.  Proposals are invited that reach beyond the horizon, articulate the bottleneck to be overcome and pose specific bold plans to solve vexing problems in plant transformation.</p>
          <p>Proposals are invited in any research area related to plant transformation of plants of economic importance including, but not limited to, research into the fundamental underpinnings of the biology that impedes progress. Research areas could include exploring the biological or genomic processes of transformation or plant regeneration; developing new synthetic biology approaches; enhancing somatic embryogenesis to improve plant regeneration; developing new technologies or vectors; partnering with engineers or other disciplines that can bring all-new perspectives to the problem; discovering ways to circumvent genotype-specific or tissue culture requirements; automating steps to increase throughput; and promoting education and training of experts in transformation biology. Advances that unify approaches across crops are especially encouraged. Plant species to be investigated are not delimited, but justification and/or evidence should be provided for how advancement of the transformation would benefit plants of economic importance.</p>
          <p>Proposals must articulate the question(s) to be addressed or the particular bottleneck in the transformation pipeline for the crop(s), models or related plants being investigated.  Proposals should include experimental methods, evidence of capability and facilities to carry out the work, expected outcomes, plans for dissemination and a concerted high impact training plan. High risk, high reward approaches are encouraged in this challenge grant opportunity.<em> Proposals that seek support exclusively for the establishment or maintenance of a major plant transformation facility are not encouraged and may be returned without review.</em></p>
          <p><strong><em>Data Challenge Grants (MINE-PGR): </em></strong><em>Data challenge for small grants to mine existing datasets.</em></p>
          <p>Sequencing and other high throughput technologies have advanced at a rapid pace, surpassing the rate of data analysis. Large publicly available datasets are untapped resources that can be analyzed in new ways and repurposed to yield new information. In the process, novel analytical tools and methods can be developed. An underlying premise of this challenge opportunity is that re-using data will help expose areas in which data standardization and coordination is needed. Enhancement of analytical tools will ultimately benefit the production and analysis of new datasets. </p>
          <p>Researchers are invited to submit proposals to mine, re-use and potentially reconfigure data workflows to address new questions in genomics that might have not been originally conceived at the time of data generation. Especially encouraged are proposals that enable the linkage of datasets, such as sequence data with those generated by high-throughput phenotyping, proteomic or metabolomic technologies  Improvement of genome sequence analysis from assembly to annotation remains critical. Plans for converging on community-approved standards for data acquisition could be included in a proposal submitted to this area.</p>
          <p>This data challenge supports research that mines existing publicly available datasets; it does not support generation of new datasets, except as needed to complete the targeted analysis or as outcomes of the data reuse. Proposals should explain the new question or challenge being addressed, the nature of the dataset(s), the methods to be used and the products expected. Consistent with all PGRP projects, the release of all data, software and/or tools developed under these awards is required. A budget limit is not imposed, but proposals for smaller awards and/or shorter duration are welcomed where appropriate.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Early Career Awards</em><em> (ECA-PGR) </em><em>and Mid-Career Awards</em><em> (MCA-PGR</em></strong><strong>): </strong><em>To advance careers in plant genomics.</em></p>
          <p>The PGRP continues to advocate for broadening the participation of scientists in plant genomics. Although well-integrated education and training efforts are expected of all proposals, the PGRP recognizes there are times when a career trajectory would benefit from focused training or mentoring in plant genomics. One important transition is when early career investigators first establish research programs in tenure-track, or equivalent, positions. Another transition is at a mid-stage (post-tenure or equivalent and pre-retirement) when research efforts would benefit from new technologies and genomics approaches. For these reasons, the PGRP offers two career funding opportunities: early career awards (ECA-PGR) to launch careers in plant genomics and mid-career awards (MCA-PGR) to revitalize a research program in state-of-the-art genomics approaches.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><em>ECA-PGR:</em></strong> Early career investigators are invited to submit proposals for PGRP projects that will advance their careers in plant genomics research. <strong>For eligibility,</strong> an ECA investigator must already hold or show evidence of an impending appointment (within 6 months of submission) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor, or equivalent, at the time of submission. Questions about eligibility equivalency should be addressed to a PGRP Program Director. Proposals may be submitted for up to four years following the start date of a tenure-track appointment and prior to tenure. Co-PIs and other senior personnel may be included in the proposal, particularly as mentors. An ECA investigator may submit only one proposal as a PI within a 12-month period from the date of submission. <strong>All ECA proposals should fit the goals of the PGRP</strong> as outlined in this solicitation. Proposals should include a brief statement about long-term career plans in plant genomics, including the identification of career mentor(s) and a description of how the awardee will interact with the mentor(s). Requests for support for travel or training may be included. As with all PGRP proposals, an ECA project should be fully integrated with the relevant genomics community of the crop plant or process being studied and should make full use of data, materials, information, expertise, and facilities already available in plant genomics. <em>ECA investigators are strongly encouraged to contact a PGRP Program Director for further guidance.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><em>MCA-PGR: </em></strong>Mid-career investigators are invited to submit proposals that revitalize or infuse an already established research program with new genomics and/or bioinformatics approaches. The PGRP encourages the participation of mid-career investigators primarily trained in disciplines other than plant genomics, such as plant physiology, biochemistry, plant breeding or a non-plant research area such as mathematics, physics or engineering. Researchers focused on Arabidopsis who wish to gain experience working with crop plants are encouraged to apply. <strong>For eligibility,</strong> an MCA investigator is defined as any researcher who is post-tenure and pre-retirement, or at an equivalent career stage. Co-PIs and other senior personnel experience in genomics may be included in the proposal, particularly as mentors or to facilitate training. An MCA investigator may submit only one proposal as a PI within a 12-month period from the date of submission. <strong>All MCA proposals should fit the goals of the PGRP</strong> as outlined in this solicitation. Proposals should include a statement about the specific training activities that will engage the MCA investigator in learning plant genomics, including the site and source of the training. Requests for travel support may be included. <em>MCA investigators interested are strongly encouraged to contact a PGRP Program Director for further guidance.</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>PGRP PRIORITIES AND ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ALL PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS</strong></p>
          <p>All proposals submitted under this Program Solicitation should be aligned with the goals of the PGRP articulated herein. Applicants are encouraged to contact Program Directors with any questions about research ideas and submissions. A description of the hallmarks of successful PGRP proposals may be useful when planning submission:</p>
          <p><strong><em>(1) The proposed research focuses on plants of economic importance and tackles questions of biological and societal importance</em></strong><em>.</em> Societal needs are changing as rapidly as research is progressing. Agricultural challenges, climate change, and resource loss demands the power of foundational research that can be translated into practical outcomes. To this end, PGRP remains committed to supporting upstream basic research that can be envisioned for downstream impact, to the benefit of society. <em>Proposals that address Arabidopsis research exclusively, or plants not significantly linked to biological processes of societal importance, will be returned without review.</em></p>
          <p><strong><em>(2) Genome-wide research questions and approaches are used.</em></strong> Proposals should align with the overarching scientific goals of the PGRP with emphases on genome-wide research questions and approaches in economically important plants. Proposals focused on individual genes or gene families are more appropriate for funding through other BIO programs <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_list.jsp?org=BIO&amp;ord=rect">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_list.jsp?org=BIO&amp;ord=rect</a>. <em>Proposals of this type will be returned without review.</em> </p>
          <p><strong><em>(3) Transdisciplinarity is included when appropriate:</em></strong> The Program encourages proposals that apply new skills and ideas to solve problems currently considered intractable. Breakthrough ideas and novel methodologies can be enabled by approaches that transcend boundaries of disciplines. Fields such as engineering, computational science and modeling, physics, mathematics and biomechanics have already had an impact on genomics, but there remains a need for transdisciplinary synergy to solve overarching biological problems.</p>
          <p><strong><em>(4) Investigative teams of all kinds, including single- or multi-investigator and single- or multi-institutional are justified</em></strong><strong>.</strong> PGRP investigators have established a highly collaborative culture that values and benefits from shared research and multi-disciplinary training. This high impact research can occur with multiple or single investigators, one institution or many, and large or small budgets. Teams should be optimally designed to achieve the goals of the proposed work, and budgets should be commensurate with manageable project goals.</p>
          <p><strong><em>(5) Public access and timely data release is routine. </em></strong>Data products generated from PGRP-supported research have diversified over the years and continue to be produced in massive quantities. Data products include sequences of all types, seeds, diversity populations, biological materials, genetic maps, genome browsers, informatics tools, images, software, publications, videos and movies, and teaching curricula, among other products. PGRP expects proposals to identify all data products, and to present a plan for full release and ready access within a reasonable time consistent with community standards, as articulated in the Supplementary documents of the proposal (Appendix A-1)</p>
          <p><strong><em>(6) International cooperation is included when appropriate. </em></strong>The PGRP encourages international research collaborations. It is generally expected that non-U.S. participants will secure support from their own national programs. However, international subawards may be included under circumstances in which international investigators bring unique expertise and/or resources not available in the U.S.  Information about international subawards is available in the PAPPG. In addition, a PGRP Program Director should be contacted for guidance about international collaborations and subawards.</p>
          <p><strong><em>(7) Broadening participation is inherent to the project.</em></strong> Public access to PGRP research outcomes should enable any institution to participate in plant genomics research. To broaden participation, PGRP encourages applications from EPSCoR jurisdictions, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU). Investigators are encouraged to think beyond their immediate colleague network to incorporate diversity in their scientific endeavors. <em>All projects are expected to explain how project participation will be diversified and broadened as part of their Broader Impacts activities.</em></p>
          <p><strong><em>(8) Training, education and communication is strong and fully integrated. </em></strong>Research ideas and endeavors need rejuvenation by new participants. For this reason, PGRP continues to emphasize training, outreach and education that is integrated with the research and with tangible outcomes.  There are also major gaps in communication about science society-wide. Investigators are encouraged to think creatively and include activities that will successfully penetrate societal communication barriers. Efforts could include, but are not limited to, training for translational research by including breeders in genomics projects and developing citizen science activities or other public outreach.

In each instance, the person responsible for data release should be clearly identified in this section. The guidelines provided here follow recommendations of the community-driven <strong><em>Toronto International Data Release Workshop</em></strong> described on the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5338">PGRP website</a>. The proposed plan must take into consideration the following conditions where applicable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-throughput large-scale sequencing projects that produce whole genome sequences, genome assemblies, whole genome SNP and methylome collections, BAC end sequencing, transcriptomes, ESTs, and full-length cDNA sequences, among others, produce the major resources from PGRP investment. For this reason, these sequences must be uploaded to a public databases, such as NCBI GenBank, at the pre-publication stage as soon as they are assembled and quality checked following currently accepted community standards (e.g. Bermuda/Ft. Lauderdale agreement, see <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5338">PGRP website</a>.). Release of these sequences to project websites is acceptable, but such releases are of limited longevity; therefore, evidence of release to public repositories is required.</li>
          <li>Sequences generated by hypothesis-driven projects and of limited scope are required to be released to a public database (e.g. NCBI GenBank) at the time of publication or before the end of the project, even if publication has not been completed. These data are required to meet acceptable quality standards and should include metadata.</li>
          <li>Projects that produce genome-wide information, including, but not exclusive to, nucleotide, epigenomic, small RNA, RNA sequencing, proteomics and/or metabolomics data must also be made available as soon as quality check satisfies specifications articulated. The timing of release should be stated clearly in the proposal. The public databases where the data will be deposited should be clearly indicated. Release of these data to project websites is acceptable, but such releases are of limited longevity; therefore, evidence of release to public repositories is required.</li>
          <li>Biological materials, including seeds, as well as constructs, software and similar community resources produced with NSF funding, must be made available in a timely manner to the scientific community, including industry. These materials should be checked for quality according to standards specified. Plans for release of information, and/or collaboration through publication, must be explained. Resource projects may develop authorship arrangements as appropriate for the project and should explain expected collaborative authorship.</li>
          <li>Projects that produce non-sequence data or biological resources such as seeds, constructs, and/or curricular materials (or other such resources) must provide a sustainability plan to maintain the resources post-award. The sustainability plan cannot include seeking additional Program funds for maintenance. Outlets such as DRYAD and other public repositories could be included as part of the sustainability plan.</li>
          <li>Letters of commitment should be provided from databases or stock centers that agree to distribute project outcomes, including the actions planned and funds needed (if any) for the distribution.</li>
          <li>A reasonable charge for community resources is permissible, but the fee structure must be outlined clearly in the proposal. For this reason, budgeting and planning for short-term and long-term distribution of the project outcomes must be described. Any charge or access differences between industry and the academic community must be clearly spelled out. If a Material Transfer Agreement is required for release of project outcomes, the terms must be described in detail. No reach-through rights are allowed. Data or materials resulting from NSF-funded research obtained with proprietary materials must be readily available without any restrictions to the users. For this reason, the terms of any usage agreements should be stated clearly in the proposal.</li>
          <li>In case of a multi-institutional proposal, the lead institution is responsible for coordinating and managing the intellectual property resulting from the PGRP award. Institutions participating in multi-institutional projects should formulate a coherent plan for the project prior to submission of the proposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Appendix A-1 must be submitted as a supplementary document <em>in lieu</em> of the DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN (DMP) required of all proposals submitted to NSF. PGRP permits up to 3 pages for the DMP.  However, FastLane will not allow submission of a proposal with a DMP in excess of the 2-page maximum. <strong><em>For this reason, you must submit a single sheet in the DMP module and add the text "SEE APPENDIX A-1 UPLOADED AS A SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT".</em></strong></p>

          <li> A table summarizing the role of each investigator is required for multi-investigator proposals. The exact time commitment of each key project member should be indicated, regardless of any salary request from NSF. Community resource projects should include a timetable with yearly goals, each with benchmarks for the major anticipated outcomes and expected dates for their release.</li>
          <li>Proposals that include distribution of community research resources should include a management plan. This plan should include: methods to make the community aware of the available services or resources including conditions for access, methods for quality control, and ways to solicit feedback from the community. The plan should also document institutional commitment to the facility, user fees if anticipated, and plans for long-term support after the end of the project. Appointment of a project manager and/or administrator is feasible in some cases.</li>
          <li>Management of educational, outreach or training activities should be included.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>(A-3) Coordination with Outside Groups </em></strong>(maximum 2 pages): Projects with activities that are part of a national or international collaboration should describe the relationship of the proposed activities and how the components will be coordinated.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
     
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
     <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>For proposals submitted to the MCA-PGR opportunity</strong>, reviewers will be asked to comment on the proposed training plan (Appendix A-6) and whether the proposed activities will enhance the applicant's career development and research transition to the field of plant genomics.</p>
        <p><strong>For proposals submitted to the ECA-PGR opportunity,</strong> reviewers will be asked to comment on the career development plan (Appendix A-6), including mentoring, and whether the proposed activities will help launch the career of the applicant.</p>
        <p><strong>For proposals involving international collaborations and subawards,</strong> reviewers will be asked to assess the mutual benefits and collaboration potential among the partners. Reviewers will comment on whether the expertise and specialized skills, facilities, sites and/or resources of the international counterparts are essential to project outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>For all proposals submitted</strong>, reviewers will be asked to specifically comment on the following aspects of a project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The data management plan (Appendix A-1) will be evaluated to ensure that the plan for data release and access is consistent with PGRP objectives. </li>
          <li>Reviewers will be asked to assess plans for sustainability, continued access, maintenance and/or operation of services past the lifetime of an award.</li>
          <li>Reviewers will be asked to comment on the training and mentoring plan for post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students, if these individuals are included in the budget.</li>
          <li>Reviewers will be asked to comment on feasibility of time commitments for all investigators, including PI, co-PI and senior personnel. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Several review panels will be assembled, depending on the number of proposals received. Some panelists may participate virtually.</p>
    
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
