<a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div><p>The Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) funds numerous research programs that require the use of observing facilities. Since 2005, AGS has supported more than 80 field programs - including twelve large (often international and/or multi-agency) projects as well as numerous single-PI experiments and a substantial number of educational deployments - for an average of more than 10 per calendar year across all deployment types.  To enable these research projects, AGS maintains a suite of national facilities under the auspices of its Lower Atmosphere Observing Facilities (LAOF) program. The LAOF includes an array of sensors and platforms, such as the CSU-CHILL radar, NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V and C-130 aircraft, University of Wyoming King Air, Cloud Radar and Cloud Lidar, and a mobile Doppler radar facility presently operated by the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR). </p><p>The cooperative agreement for the current mobile Doppler radar facility was awarded in 2008. Since that time, it has been the most-requested of the NSF/AGS national LAO facilities, having been sought by members of the research community on average 13 times per calendar year and awarded through the facilities allocation process on average 8 times per year. The mobile Doppler radar facility has participated in large campaigns such as Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes (VORTEX and VORTEX-2), as well as in smaller projects and in approximately 20 deployments for education and public outreach. The facility receives base support through the cooperative agreement as well as supplemental funds to cover project-specific costs for each approved deployment.</p><p>In accordance with NSF policy that all facility awards must be re-competed after an appropriate period of operation (NSB-08-12 and NSB-08-16), this solicitation seeks proposals to provide and operate a mobile Doppler radar facility for both research and educational purposes for the next five years. Assuming continuing community need for such a facility, successful performance by the facility and taking into consideration budgetary constraints, renewal of the award may be considered for an additional five years.</p></div>
<h3>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div>
<p>Description of Services Required:</p><p>The Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences is seeking proposals that maintain the level of service provided by the current facility. Upgrades or expansions may be possible over the life of the award as budgets, community needs and improved technologies allow. </p><p>Proposals for acquisition of mobile radars will not be accepted; proposers are expected to own and operate a least one mobile Doppler radar currently and to make these facilities available to the community on a competitive basis. A description of the services currently required by the atmospheric science community and expected by NSF is given below.</p><p><strong>A. Expected Categories of Facility Requests</strong></p><p><strong>1. NSF-supported Projects</strong></p><p><strong>a. Deployment for Field Research Projects</strong></p><p>The primary responsibility of the mobile Doppler radar facility is to provide support to AGS-funded principal investigators. Projects can range from short, single-investigator studies to large, complex, multi-investigator projects. Some projects may require deployment outside the continental United States. While scientific collaboration between the proposing PI(s) and the facility staff is possible, it is not essential to the use of the facility. Facility providers may use the facility assets for their own research purposes <strong>only</strong> with consent of the NSF Lower Atmosphere Observing Facilities (LAOF) manager.</p><p><strong>b. Deployment for Educational and Outreach Purposes</strong></p><p>NSF entertains requests from educators to gain access to observational facilities for classroom instruction and hands-on learning experiences. Instruments can be made available for graduate, undergraduate and K-12 education, including the deployment of a facility to a university for a limited period of time, as well as for public outreach activities at museums and conferences. While not always required, facility staff often actively participate in these deployments by, for example, teaching students how to use the facility, giving public lectures, and/or carrying out data analysis activities. The mobile Doppler radar facility is expected to be available for educational and outreach deployments as requested by PIs and approved by the LAOF manager.</p><p><strong>2. Non-NSF-Supported Projects</strong></p><p>Under some circumstances, NSF-sponsored observing facilities may be allocated for use by non-NSF-sponsored projects on a cost-recovery basis. All costs for these projects must be provided by the sponsoring agency and are recovered by the facility. To be allocated, such projects must occur on a non-interference basis and must represent a good use of the facility by supporting or enhancing the science objectives of the NSF-sponsored community, by meeting a national need and/or by providing desirable training opportunities for facility staff.  As with NSF-sponsored deployments, the decision to allocate facilities for &quot;cost-recovery&quot; projects rests with NSF. Disposition of the funds recovered by the facility from these types of projects is also at the discretion of NSF.</p><p><strong>B. Scope of Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Both NSF- and non-NSF-supported researchers request the facility through a process managed by the AGS LAOF Program Officer. Details of this process may be found at the following URL: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/request-info">http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/request-info</a>; any necessary clarification may be obtained from the LAOF Program Officer. Facility staff are expected to be fully engaged in this process and to provide relevant information about facility capabilities, availability and cost to all proposing Principal Investigators as they prepare their scientific proposals and facility requests. Facility staff are expected to interact with the staff of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Earth Observing Laboratory to prepare for the biannual Observing Facilities Assessment Panel (OFAP) meetings. Appropriate facility staff are expected to participate in these panel meetings to discuss the feasibility of proposed experimental designs. Shortly following these meetings, the Facility Manager will submit to NSF a written statement on the feasibility of all requests in a format to be determined by NSF. Final decisions on the allocation of facilities are made by the NSF. </p><p>The facility is expected to have adequate staff to deploy the mobile radar facility for domestic and international projects. The facility should be able to support the preparation and execution of field projects up to six weeks in length using base staff (see Section II.E. Budget). </p><p><strong>C. Facility Management</strong></p><p>A single manager or director must have overall responsibility for the facility. Duties related to instrument operation and maintenance, data processing and management, etc., should be divided among facility staff as appropriate. The director should be a scientist with expertise in radar technology and applications of radar to atmospheric science research. Up to four co-PI's may be listed on the proposal and their CVs are required. CVs for all other key personnel should be included in the Supplementary Documents. </p><p>In the event that a consortium of institutions proposes to provide and operate the facility, the project must be managed by a single organization with other organizations involved via sub-awards. Collaborative proposals must be submitted using the &quot;single proposal&quot; method as described in Chapter II.D.4.a of the GPG.  If the collaborative mechanism is chosen, an organizational chart and clear guidelines for management of a distributed facility must be included in the Supplementary Documents.</p><p>In addition to serving as the director of the facility's activities, the facility manager is expected to interact with AGS program officers and the LAOF manager on a regular basis, keeping them informed about the status of the facility and about issues that arise during deployments. The facility manager is typically the main point of contact for PIs interested in using the facility and s/he also interacts regularly with other facility managers. The facility manager should expect to be the spokesperson for the facility, making its capabilities and availability known through discussions and presentations at appropriate national and specialty conferences, through publications and through a publicly accessible web presence.</p><p><strong>D. Data services and management</strong></p><p>Because Doppler radars produce enormous amounts of data when they are in operation, the facility is expected to maintain an adequate data storage and back-up capability to manage this data during field studies and in the near-term post-project. The ultimate repository for the field data should be determined in consultation between the PI and the facility manager. Care must be taken to abide by NSF's policies about dissemination and sharing of research results (Chapter VI.D.4 of the Award and Administration Guide).</p><p>Most PIs will also need help from facility staff to process the raw data obtained from the Doppler radar into quantities and/or analysis products of interest. </p><p><strong>E. Budget</strong></p><p>In constructing the budget for this proposal, the Principal Investigator should include costs for staff necessary to maintain the facility in an operational status (e.g., funds required for routine, home-site operations, maintenance costs, etc.), as well as to provide all required pre-project support described in Section II.B above. The budget should include staff time that would be required nominally to deploy and operate the facility on a remote project. Out-of-pocket, episodic costs required to deploy the facility on a project should not be included, as they will normally be covered through supplemental awards from the LAOF &quot;Deployment Pool&quot;. Examples of costs that would fall under Deployment Pool support are transport of the facility to the research location, site preparation, overtime staff charges, gasoline for vehicles and generators, etc. Estimates of the costs for prescribed hypothetical deployments should be submitted as requested in Section V.A.10.D of this solicitation, Special Information/Supplementary Documentation.</p><p><strong>F. External oversight</strong></p><p>NSF will conduct at least one mid-award review to assess the overall management and operations of the facility. This review may involve a site visit. The mid-award review may factor into subsequent decisions by NSF about renewal of support for the facility.</p>

  <h3><a name="review" id="review"></a>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES 
  </h3>
  <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p><p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p><p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p><p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p><p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
  
  <a name="reviewcrit" title="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
  
  <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot;  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p><p>1. Merit Review Principles</p><p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p><ul><li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />  </li><li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />  </li><li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li></ul><p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p><p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p><p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p><p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />  </li><li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li></ul><p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p><ol><li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to <ol type="a"><li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li><li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li></ol></li><li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li><li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li><li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li><li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li></ol><p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p><p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p><p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Experience and qualifications of PI, senior staff and technical staff to operate and maintain the proposed facility;</li>

 </p>
 <h4>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p><h3>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p><h4>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p><p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p><h4>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4><p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p><p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" width="590" align="center" bgcolor="#e9e9e9"><tbody><tr><td><p>The National Science Foundation promotes and advances scientific progress in the United States by competitively awarding grants and cooperative agreements for research and education in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.</p><p>To get the latest information about program deadlines, to download copies of NSF publications, and to access abstracts of awards, visit the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">https://www.nsf.gov</a></p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="90%" align="center"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>Location:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>4201 Wilson Blvd. Arlington, VA 22230</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>For General Information<br /></strong>(NSF Information Center)<strong>:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5111</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>TDD (for the hearing-impaired):</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5090</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>To Order Publications or Forms:</strong></li></ul></td><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td height="25" align="middle" valign="top"><p>Send an e-mail to:</p></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p><a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td height="25" align="middle" valign="top"><p>or telephone:</p></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-7827</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>To Locate NSF Employees:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5111</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
