<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) program of the NSF Directorate for Engineering (ENG) serves a critical role in helping ENG focus on important emerging areas in a timely manner. This solicitation is a funding opportunity for interdisciplinary teams of researchers to embark on rapidly advancing frontiers of fundamental engineering research. For this solicitation, we will consider proposals that aim to investigate emerging frontiers in the following two research areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Advancing Communication Quantum Information Research in Engineering</strong> (ACQUIRE)</li>
              <li><strong>New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time-Reversal Symmetry</strong> (NewLAW)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This solicitation will be coordinated with the Directorate for Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), within NSF. </p>
            <p>EFRI seeks proposals with transformative ideas that represent an opportunity for a significant shift in fundamental engineering knowledge with a strong potential for long term impact on national needs or a grand challenge.  The proposals must also meet the detailed requirements delineated in this solicitation.</p>
            <p><strong>INFORMATION WEBCAST: </strong>The Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA) Office held an informational workshop on October 23, 2015 to discuss the EFRI program and answer questions about the FY 2016 ACQUIRE and NewLAW solicitation.

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (<a title="About EFMA" href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/efma/about.jsp">EFMA</a>) in the Directorate for Engineering provides funding opportunities for interdisciplinary teams of researchers to embark on rapidly advancing frontiers of fundamental engineering research. The Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/efma/efri.jsp">EFRI</a>), the signature program of the EFMA Office, seeks proposals with potentially transformative ideas that represent an opportunity for a significant shift in fundamental engineering knowledge with a strong potential for long term impact on national needs or a grand challenge. For this solicitation, EFRI will consider proposals that aim to investigate emerging frontiers in the following two specific research areas: 1) Advancing Communication Quantum Information Research in Engineering (ACQUIRE), and 2) New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time-Reversal Symmetry (NewLAW). Proposals must meet the detailed requirements delineated in this solicitation.</p>
          <p><strong>(1) Advancing Communication Quantum Information Research in Engineering (ACQUIRE)</strong></p>
          <p>Secure and efficient data communication is of utmost importance to the public welfare, societal benefit, and national security. This EFRI topic focuses on quantum information science and engineering, one of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/reports/nsf_big_ideas.pdf">NSF's 10 Big Ideas</a> for long-term discovery and innovation. It will support interdisciplinary research in quantum communication systems with a focus on fundamental engineering challenges to enable lossless, room temperature, point-to-point links combining components, repeaters, networks and architectures. Researchers should focus on scalable, chip-level functioning devices and systems capable of operating at single and entangled photon levels. Recent progress in quantum information science, resulting in communication feasibility demonstrations, and advances in optoelectronic integration at the nanoscale are translating the field of quantum information to the engineering realm. Indeed chip-level, room temperature single photon sources, entangled pairs, quantum memory and repeaters are foreseeable devices that can enable scalable quantum communication or other applications. This topic is intended to support research by teams of engineers, physicists, and computer scientists, to address fundamental research challenges in design, fabrication, and operation of such systems. The research should include trade-offs between key relevant metrics. Of particular interest are investigations into 1) reproducible single photon sources and detectors on a chip, at or near room temperature, directly coupled to waveguides, 2) low-energy quantum devices such as repeaters, single photon wavelength converters in the telecom wavelength, and integrated quantum memories, 3) generation of quantum entangled quantum bits (Qubits) scalable to multi Qubits, and demonstration of a fiber-based quantum communication link. The research should be highly integrated with the education and training of the next generation of engineers and scientists with a broad knowledge of quantum technology and engineering. The goal is to demonstrate a reliable quantum communication link that optimizes the different aspects of the network, with the potential to provide a transformative and highly secure future network.</p>
          <p><strong>(2) New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time-Reversal Symmetry (NewLAW) </strong></p>
          <p>This topic supports engineering-led interdisciplinary research that challenges the notions of reciprocity, time-reversal symmetry and sensitivity to defects in wave propagation and field transport. The research is expected to disrupt ways in which electronic, photonic and acoustic devices are designed and employed, and to enable totally new functionalities. Platforms that may benefit from this fundamental research include electronic, photonic devices and circuits, filters, logic operators, circulators and their on-chip implementation, microwave communications, electromagnetic interference control as well as acoustic transducers for ultrasonic imaging, sonars, noise absorbing or enhancing devices, and material systems for impact and blast protection. The research will provide the opportunity to exploit physical principles that enable disruptive technologies, novel materials and new devices with higher functionality. The topic is inspired by the recent emphasis on uncovering classical materials that emulate atomic systems and condensed matter phenomena such as quantum Hall effect, topologically tuned Fano resonances, electromagnetically induced transparency, Heusler compounds, Kondo insulators, and topological insulators. Specifically, the recent discovery of electronic and photonic topological insulators is inspiring new directions in band engineering and wave manipulation through concepts guided by inspiration from condensed matter analogues.</p>

         <h3>
         II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
     
          <p>The "Required Elements" listed below for each topic are expected to be addressed in both the preliminary proposals as well as in the full proposals.<br />
            <strong><br />
            1) Advancing Communication Quantum Information Research in Engineering (ACQUIRE)</strong> - This emerging engineering area and the ensuing interdisciplinary activities will leverage established Quantum Information Science (QIS) and will impact fields such as materials science, mathematics, physics and engineering in the next decade. The lessons learned from QIS research will accelerate engineering of systems on a chip, and help define goals for successfully addressing the scientific and engineering challenges of ACQUIRE , as further outlined in Thrust Areas 1-3 below.</p>
          <p>To date research on QIS has mostly remained at the fundamental level, demonstrating the promises of quantum information technology in performing tasks that cannot readily be performed using classical approaches. With the recent progress in fabrication and integration of optoelectronics at the nanoscale, a bridge between quantum physics and engineered quantum communication networks is foreseeable. As the leading enabler of innovation, NSF seeks to empower transformative research that combines all layers of quantum components, circuits and systems, to develop practical, robust, and scalable controlled communication systems. NSF has selected &ldquo;Quantum Leap&rdquo; as one of its top ten Big Ideas in its future research investment portfolio. Quantum communication systems require a mix of competencies in theoretical and experimental physics, computer science, electrical and communication engineering. In addition, leveraging national initiatives, such as the new Integrated Photonics Manufacturing Institute, will accelerate the progress towards industrial implementation.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust Areas<br />
          </strong>Each of the proposals in response to this EFRI solicitation must address at least two of the three thrusts outlined below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop reproducible single photon sources and detectors on a chip at or near room temperature</li>
            <li>Develop low-energy quantum devices such as repeaters, memories, and other photonics</li>
            <li>Develop scalable quantum entangled Qubits, robust and secure communication links, and demonstrate a quantum circuit network, with noise correction algorithms</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The various functions must be engineered towards integration at the chip level at or near room temperature and electrical pumping over optical pumping are strongly preferred. A competitive proposal must have a collaborative and highly integrated approach with innovative solutions.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 1<br />
          </strong>Any two-level quantum system can be the foundation of quantum technology, but quantum states are highly impacted by the environment. Over the past thirty years there has been active research in the area of Qubits based on various platforms, such as cold atoms, superconducting Qubits, Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) in diamond, or Quantum Dots (QD) in photonic crystals, and several other configurations. Those platforms have enabled proof-of-concept of quantum information science. Significant progress has been made in recent years in enhancing Qubit lifetime. However, most platforms are plagued by high complexity or lack of scalability. This program seeks chip-scale platforms that can sustain robust, repeatable multi-Qubit sources, which allow quantum information communication via coherent photons. For example, the efficient information transfer between a single-atom and a single-photon requires that the atom is trapped in a high-reflectivity cavity, which sustains a strong atom-photon interaction. The trapped atom must emit a single coherent photon that communicates the information through an optical fiber.</p>
          <p>This Thrust requires fundamental understanding of material and device properties at the quantum level, characterization at the nanoscale level, and engineered devices that can provide quantum bits with superior stability and coherence. Additionally, fundamental understanding of light-matter interfaces at the quantum state is required. Reproducible design tool kits, chip fabrication and integration with electronic controls, and characterization tools are important aspects of the research. Facilities that can provide the necessary design kits, integration, and testing tools, for reproducible fabrication, are recommended. Partnering with government laboratories such as NIST or Sandia or industrial collaborators equipped with the appropriate metrology capabilities, is encouraged.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 2<br />
          </strong>The generation and engineering of entangled Qubits requires development of the appropriate platform. For example photon pairs can be obtained by down-conversion of a pump laser through a nonlinear crystal. Current devices suffer from severe performance limitations. Efficient coupling of the photons into and out of a waveguide, polarization control, and low loss links are critical requirements of entangled photons quantum circuit engineering. Recent demonstrations of point-to-point direct quantum communication indicate the potentials of this technology. However some transmission losses are unavoidable. In order to increase the distance over which the Qubits can communicate, quantum repeaters (both quantum relay and quantum memories) must be developed. Quantum repeaters are typically based on photon detection and conversion by light-matter interaction.  Critical functionalities include the development of chips providing efficient quantum frequency conversion to telecom wavelengths for transmission over optical fibers.  Quantum memory nodes integrated on a chip with special properties will need to be developed for effective memory storage.  These nodes must be able to store a Qubit for a period long enough to allow successful transmission of photons between several of them.  Additionally, the photons must be releasable in an energy-efficient manner. This allows links concatenation as a means to extend the distance over which quantum information can be transported. The nodes can also provide means to purify the Qubit pairs to provide a highly entangled pair to the next link.</p>
          <p>This Thrust requires non-linear light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, integratable non-linear materials, reproducible nano-scale controls in the fabrication stages, and high precision characterization tools.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 3<br />
          </strong>Since device performance requirements are being driven by the systems application, exploration of the sub-systems is highly pertinent to this program. The importance of secure communication is a clear requirement in most communication systems. In the conventional Alice-to-Bob (sender to receiver) communication links, secure communication is achieved by means of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).  Advanced quantum cryptography that is practical, inherently robust and implementable in actual fully secure communication links should be considered. Quantum communication systems based on single photon circuits and novel protocols, will provide means to securely communicate data over a traditional infrastructure. Two types of links can be selected, fiber-optic based optical telecommunication link, or short reach free space communication link. While an entangled state in a lossless environment can ensure secure communication, detection with appropriate noise correction algorithms provides the distance information transportation. Realistic quantum communication networks integrating the above thrusts, and engineered to be compatible with current fiber optic networks are sought.</p>
          <p>Thrust 3 requires expertise in fiber communication networks, quantum cryptography, and access to an adequate testbed demonstration platform.</p>
          <p><strong>EFRI-ACQUIRE Programmatic Considerations  </strong></p>
          <p>Quantum communication is beginning to emerge with recent advances in quantum information science and nanotechnology fabrication, allowing table top experiments to translate to early engineered systems. We strongly encourage developing solid-state quantum communication devices and circuits operating at or near room temperature and characterizing any trade-offs between robust and secure communication links and device temperature.  Progress in this field will greatly benefit from active collaboration from experts on materials, components, device integration on a chip, and communication networking.</p>
          <p>Engineering Challenges: In view of the current challenges included in the three thrusts, consideration should be given to addressing the critical trade-offs in the devices and systems envisioned, the actual performance targets of the complete system or sub-system, including fabrication challenges, reproducibility, scalability, and characterization methods.</p>
          <p>Interdisciplinary Research: While the quantum communication research should be led by engineering investigators, innovative concepts to advance the field will benefit from teams with synergistic expertise in the following fields: photonics, physics of quantum materials and information, mathematics, and quantum cryptography. Preference will be given to teams that address all three thrusts.</p>
          <p>International Exchange: We encourage collaboration with international scientific teams that are leaders in the field. Travel support for the Principal Investigators and students may be considered under the proposal application, or through travel supplements, during the course of the award.</p>
          <p><strong>2) New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time-Reversal Symmetry (NewLAW) - </strong>This emerging technical area and the ensuing interdisciplinary activities should be coordinated by engineering-led teams that include contributions from researchers in material, mathematical and physical sciences. Highly innovative proposals are sought that build upon established and emerging research in non-reciprocity and topologically protected wave propagation, and that impact fields such as electromagnetics, electronics, photonics, opto-mechanics, acoustics, mechanics, material science, and dynamics and control. The exploration of concepts over a broad range of scales is expected to lead to new findings that support the design of &ldquo;topologically nontrivial&rdquo; photonic, electronic and acoustic systems. Projects should include relevant activities in the following three thrust areas, with clear innovation in at least one: 1) modeling, 2) analysis, design and control, and 3) fabrication, testing and characterization.</p>
          <p><strong>Background<br />
          </strong>Frequency, wave-vector, polarization and phase are properties often used to describe wave phenomena and the characteristics of the associated physical domains. Careful tailoring of these properties has led to exciting advances in the areas of electronics, photonics, acoustics and thermal transport. The application of topology has recently emerged as an additional degree of freedom for the analysis and design of new systems and for the discovery of states associated with unusual wave properties. In the context of this solicitation, topology refers to the properties that characterize the quantized behavior of some topological invariants, a specific property of the wavefunctions over the associated dispersion bands. Topological states in electronic materials have inspired recent developments in photonics, where studies have shown how the use of carefully designed systems with nontrivial topologies in the wave-vector (reciprocal) space can lead to the emergence of new states of light at their interfaces, with potentially useful properties as well as electronics where asymmetric scattering of Dirac electrons driven back and forth by a terahertz electric field results in DC surface electron transport. Topological insulators are characterized by dissipation-free interfacial electron transport exhibiting robust propagation in the presence of impurities. Similarly, unidirectional waveguides that allow light to flow around defects without back-reflection have been pursued as potential enablers of numerous technological applications and devices. In recent years, topological effects have been investigated in photonic crystals, coupled resonators, metamaterials and quasicrystals. Investigations have also extended these concepts to photonics, mechanics and acoustics, where topologically protected propagation is obtained by exploiting rotating fluids, or Coriolis and gyroscopic effects.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrusts<br />
          </strong>The objective of this solicitation is to support the investigation of novel concepts guided by inspiration from condensed matter analogues or by exploration of new approaches to time/space symmetry breaking, non-reciprocity and topologically protected field transport. Highly interdisciplinary projects are sought that pursue breakthroughs in the following three thrusts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Modeling</li>
            <li>Analysis, design and control</li>
            <li>Fabrication, testing and characterization</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their ability to describe activities relevant to all three thrust areas, and their effectiveness to define clear innovations in at least one thrust area.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 1: Modeling<br />
          </strong>Many of the preliminary studies rely on conceptual, simplified models that are often characterized by lumped parameters and low-dimensionality. While effective for physical insight and to illustrate key concepts, such models do not capture the full complexity of the physical systems under consideration, and cannot address outstanding challenges associated, for example, with the presence of multiple, coupled bands and polarizations, or with high dimensionality. A strong modeling component is needed to support analysis, design and control activities, and to subsequently guide fabrication and experimentation. Based on the available literature, it is envisioned that most configurations will consist of basic units, e.g. unit cells, assembled to form lattice-type structures. The properties of these assemblies, including several different media sustaining the transport of various field quantities (acoustic, electromagnetic, mechanical), should be inferred based on analyses conducted on unit cells, representative elements, or finite domains.</p>
          <p>Proposals responding to this solicitation should discuss modeling approaches and analytical/numerical tools employed to predict and characterize dispersion topology in complex electronics, optical, acoustic, mechanical and coupled domains. Researchers may consider, for example, the application of innovative numerical techniques for the discretization of continuous systems, dynamic network models, or homogenization techniques that capture the complex dynamic behavior of lattice assemblies. Analytical and numerical procedures for the estimation of dispersion may need to account for spatially and time-varying properties, or for the presence of nonlinearities associated with constitutive properties or of geometrical nature, resulting from large deformations or exposure to high amplitude fields. Analysis and understanding of transport properties in the proposed materials as well as their interfaces with other materials are important.  The dependence of various properties such as absorbance and transport from microwaves to optical wavelengths requires further fundamental understanding.  Fundamental electronic structure analysis should assist in achieving room temperature operation and understanding the role of surface states.  Ways of controlling the band gap and band inversion in topological materials could be better understood through modeling.  Modeling efforts are expected to provide significant opportunities for leveraging multi-physics interactions, for example, through combined photo-elastic, magneto-elastic, piezo-elastic, electro-optical, and electro-mechanical effects, or by exploiting wave mode interactions across different polarizations. It is expected that the tools arising from this effort will encompass levels of complexity from low-dimension conceptual models up to high-fidelity 3D models. Projects may also propose homogenized or continuum models to accelerate performance assessment and design studies.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 2: Analysis, design and control<br />
          </strong>The models developed in Thrust 1 will support new results in analysis, design and control of non-reciprocal systems. Proposers should investigate conditions, configurations and physical systems that enable symmetry breaking, non-reciprocity and topologically protected transport to occur -- and potentially be controlled -- in various physical domains of interest. The objective is to define mechanisms that lead to non-conventional wave motion, such as magnetic spins, resonating systems and passive lattices possibly with internal rotational degrees of freedom and non-center symmetric geometries. Proposers are also encouraged to explore alternative approaches relying on the coupling among physical domains, among different propagation modes, or based on active control concepts. Control of local symmetries may be investigated in the framework of networked structures, with the goal of exploring the possibilities afforded by the ability to introduce &ldquo;defects&rdquo;, &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo; or &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; that are controllable and that can be adapted based on feedback information. Innovations that leverage the ability of limited local actuation to achieve overall performance characteristics in terms of the propagation of perturbations within the network are relevant to this solicitation. Studies that are of interest within this context include distributed control concepts for reconfigurable non-reciprocal systems, optimal placement strategies for defect states and boundaries, and dynamics of reconfigurable systems over multiple time scales. These investigations could open new opportunities whereby the effects of local symmetries and symmetry breaking have implications on synchronization effects, stability and localization. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamic interactions among the constituents, or internal to the units, could lead to amplitude-dependent responses, time-dependent properties, stability, internal resonances -- in particular in the form of self-trapped states in the bulk and at interfaces -- multi-harmonic responses, and coupling across frequencies. Opportunities may also arise from symmetry breaking configurations resulting from spatial topological changes resulting from instability, or due to the presence of multiple stable equilibrium configurations. Studies assisting in the identification of the parameters dictating the topological properties and allowing their control for reproducible device implementation, including insulating properties robustness are a key.  Tradeoffs in doping, composition and material phases for eliminating technological compromises require further work.</p>
          <p>While the areas above are presented as examples of potential research avenues, proposers are strongly encouraged to consider alternative mechanisms, configurations, materials and physical systems that enable topological states associated with symmetry engineering and reduction, to occur and potentially be controlled in various physical domains of interest.</p>
          <p><strong>Thrust 3: Fabrication, testing and characterization<br />
          </strong>It is expected that the analysis, design and control studies of thrust 2 will be followed by experimental demonstration of the conceptual solutions. Experiments should support the validation of models developed in thrust 1. Because the level of technology readiness varies greatly across fields such as electronics, photonics, acoustics, mechanics, opto-mechanics etc., it is further expected that these experimental activities will span a broad range of objectives. In less developed areas, experimentation may be limited to demonstrating particular phenomena predicted by theory and modeling, such as one-way propagation, very large isolation, topological protected wave propagation, and scattering-free propagation. Other relevant dynamic behaviors may be explored as they are uncovered. In disciplines where substantial preliminary work already exists, for example, electronics, photonics, investigators may demonstrate device prototypes based on the uncovered functionalities. Concepts enabling or facilitating integration should be investigated in support of development efforts for integrated nanophotonic elements based on topological insulators with robust one-way propagation, integrated circuits for full-duplex communications, or defect-insensitive waveguiding. Electronic, photonic and acoustic device and material growth driven approaches should be explored for reproducible and controllable ways of bandgap energy and use of the conducting and insulating nature of topological insulators at room temperature.  This should include design, growth, fabrication and characterization approaches that permit performance prediction and design compatible operation.  Electronic transport properties in topological insulators alone but also interfacing with other materials is of major importance for electronic device implementation and requires in-depth studies.  Developments of this type should lead to the discovery of devices based on new materials, making topological insulators more suitable for practical implementation.  Competitive teams addressing such disciplines should demonstrate expertise in the appropriate supporting functions, such as micro and nano fabrication, circuit integration, and experimentation and characterization of the envisioned devices. Testing and fabrication efforts should be also focused on the integration of symmetry breaking units within an equivalent acoustic or elastic material systems, possibly avoiding the need for external sources of energy that induce mean flows or internal rotations. Advancements in this area are expected to require innovations in fabrication and manufacturing of complex material configurations and structures that involve several length scales. Applications that may drive innovation and that may benefit from the findings in this area include new venues for ultrasound imaging, sonar interrogation, and acoustic-based signal conditioning and processing. Size and weight may become important driving factors for application of NewLAW concepts to novel sound-absorbing materials, protective layers for impact protection, or stealth systems. If applicable, practical advantages provided by concepts relevant to this solicitation should be addressed. Moreover, multi-physics interactions are likely to play important roles in controlling symmetries and wavefunctions topology. Thus, the fabrication techniques to be employed may consider the integration of active or smart materials with photo-elastic, magneto-elastic, piezo-elastic, electro-optical, and electro-mechanical properties. Furthermore, the integration of soft-materials compatible with large deformations and engineered instabilities should be considered as means to explore the importance of geometry and spatial topology and their adaptation in response to external stimuli.</p>
          <p>To maximize the chances for post-EFRI support and the transition of most promising concepts, collaboration with industrial partners is highly encouraged. Proposals should demonstrate understanding of challenges in manufacturing, processing, scaling and commercialization. Projects that show a clear pathway to applications, including scalability, are especially encouraged. When appropriate, proposers may consider a formal mechanism for academic-industry collaboration, such as the NSF GOALI program.</p>
          <p><strong>EFRI-NewLAW Programmatic Considerations<br />
          </strong>Among the programmatic considerations, the following features are deemed important under this NewLAW research area in order to realize the promise of this field over the coming years:</p>
          <p>Interdisciplinary Research: Progress in this field will benefit tremendously from research that draws on many disciplines including physics, chemistry and engineering; thus it is only natural to enable scientists and engineers to work together more effectively in research teams involving theory, modeling, design, characterization, and/or device fabrication and testing. Each team must address all 3 thrust areas, with clear indication of innovation in at least one of the thrust areas.</p>
          <p>Industrial Partnerships: Reaching out to American industry partners will be critical to developing scalable techniques for synthesizing these materials and for outreach in training students who can work with the industrial partners. Creation of an academia-industry axis in the development of applications and subsequent commercialization of technologies based on NewLAW concepts is therefore encouraged.</p>
          <p>Mathematical Sciences Partnerships: The ideas, tools, and language of mathematics and statistics play important roles in engineering research, and it is widely recognized that interactions between the mathematical sciences and engineering catalyze developments in both.  Collaborative research projects involving mathematical scientists have the potential to lead to transformative results in EFMA projects. Researchers from mathematics and statistics are especially encouraged to participate in new collaborative projects in this important interdisciplinary area. </p>
          <p>International Exchange: We encourage collaboration with international scientific teams that are leaders in the field. Travel support for the Principal Investigators and students may be considered under the proposal application, or through travel supplements, during the course of the award.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
    
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
    <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
      
       
        <p>In addition to the two NSF review criteria (intellectual merit and broader impacts), the following criteria will be used in the review of all EFRI proposals.  For the preliminary proposals the review criteria will have a higher weight on the tranformative nature and impact of the proposed idea.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>TRANSFORMATIVE </em>-</strong> Does the proposed research represent an opportunity for a significant leap or paradigm shift in fundamental engineering knowledge?</li>
          <li><em><strong>NATIONAL NEED/GRAND CHALLENGE </strong></em>- Is there potential for making significant progress on a current national need or grand challenge?</li>
          <li>Responsiveness to "<strong>Programmatic Considerations</strong>" for <strong>EFRI-ACQUIRE and EFRI-NewLAW</strong> proposals as delineated in Section II. Program Description.</li>
          <li><strong>Broadening Participation Plan</strong> - Does the plan actively promote, increase, and enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in the field of engineering and in engineering research?</li>
          <li>Effectiveness of the proposed <strong>management plan</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In developing its recommendations for awards, review panels as well as NSF staff will consider: the relative merit of the EFRI proposals using the criteria listed above, the potential national impact of the proposed activity, the balance of awards among scientific fields, geographical distribution, and the combined ability of the proposals to meet the objectives of the EFRI Office. The EFRI Office will not normally award more than one proposal from any one lead institution in this competition.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
      <p>  Awardees will be required to attend and present their research results and plans annually at an annual EFRI grantees' conference for the duration for their award.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
