          <p>This is a revision of <a href="http://nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=12810&amp;ods_key=nsf14593">NSF 14-593</a>. The revisions include:</p>
          <ol>
          <li> New due dates. Requirement of a preliminary proposal submission prior to submission of a full CRI proposal.</li>
          <li>Addition of a fourth Community Infrastructure (CI) track to provide for ongoing operations of current community infrastructure projects that have proven value to the community so that they can implement a plan to move towards long-term community sustainability (CI-SUSTAIN). Infrastructures that have received prior Community Infrastructure Enhancement (CI-EN) or legacy (such as CI-ADDO-EN) awards must submit any new CRI proposals to this track.</li>
          <li> Allowing for 18-month budgets for CI Planning (CI-P) projects.</li>
          <li>Addition of a requirement that CI proposals include funds in their budgets to attend the annual CI principal investigators (PI) meeting.</li>
          <li>Revision of the maximum budget limit for CI proposals and awards, now $2.5 million.</li>
          <li>Addition of language to emphasize the use of existing infrastructure such as CRI community resources or Cloud resources when possible. PIs must clearly demonstrate that projects cannot be implemented on other resources.</li>
          <li>New requirement that projects pursuing Big Data as the research focus clearly show the Big Data to which the researchers will have access, and provide a more focused research agenda related to Big Data.</li>
          <li> Revisions to the Proposal Preparation Instructions, including (a) a requirement for a section titled &ldquo;Broader Impacts&rdquo; within the Project Description section of a proposal, (b) clarification of what must be included as part of &ldquo;Results from Prior NSF Support&rdquo; within the Project Description section, and (c) clarification of what may be submitted as a Letter of Collaboration and/or Commitment in the Supplementary Documents section.</li></ol>

          SUMMARY OF PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
        </h3>
        <h4>
          General Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The CISE Research Infrastructure (CRI) program drives discovery and learning in the core CISE disciplines of the three participating CISE divisions by supporting the creation and enhancement of world-class research infrastructure that will support focused research agendas in computer and information science and engineering. This infrastructure will enable CISE researchers to advance the frontiers of CISE research. Further, through the CRI program CISE seeks to ensure that individuals from a diverse range of academic institutions, including minority-serving and predominantly undergraduate institutions, have access to such infrastructure.</p>
            <p>The CRI program supports two classes of awards:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Institutional Infrastructure (II) </strong>awards support the creation of <strong>new (II-NEW)</strong> CISE research infrastructure or the <strong>enhancement (II-EN)</strong> of existing CISE research infrastructure to enable world-class CISE research opportunities at the awardee and collaborating institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Community Infrastructure (CI) </strong>awards support the <strong>planning (CI-P)</strong> for new CISE community research infrastructure, the <strong>creation of new (CI-NEW)</strong> <strong>CISE research infrastructure</strong>, the <strong>enhancement (CI-EN) of existing CISE infrastructure</strong>, or the <strong>sustainment (CI-SUSTAIN) of existing CISE community infrastructure</strong> to enable world-class CISE research opportunities for broad-based communities of CISE researchers that extend well beyond the awardee institutions. Each CI award may support the operation of such infrastructure, ensuring that the awardee institution(s) is (are) well positioned to provide a high quality of service to CISE community researchers expected to use the infrastructure to realize their research goals. </li>
            </ul>

         I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Since its inception, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported the development of research infrastructure in order to advance the frontiers of science and engineering. These research infrastructure investments enable an academic science and engineering research enterprise that continues to be among the world's best. Similarly, NSF's Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) has a tradition of supporting CISE research infrastructure to enable transformative research at the frontiers of core CISE research disciplines and to provide unique opportunities for current and future generations of CISE researchers.

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>With its CISE Research Infrastructure (CRI) program, CISE drives discovery and learning in the core CISE disciplines covered by the three participating CISE divisions through support for the creation and enhancement of world-class research infrastructure that will enable focused research agendas in computer science. Further, through the CRI program, CISE seeks to ensure that individuals from a diverse range of academic institutions, including minority-serving and predominantly undergraduate institutions, have access to such infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Examples of research infrastructure of interest to the program include, but are not limited to: systems of security and monitoring devices, linguistically annotated electronic language and vision corpora, spectrum and protocol analyzers, system testbeds, suites of robots, clusters of graphic processing units, software libraries and tools, networks of wireless and mobile devices, programmable network components, integrated systems of sensors, data repositories and visualization capabilities. These computing infrastructure resources (and others not listed here) are expected to enable unique and compelling research opportunities otherwise inaccessible to the core CISE research community.</p>
          <p>Cognizant of the diversity of research infrastructure needs in the CISE research community, the CRI program supports two classes of projects as defined below.</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Institutional Infrastructure</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each Institutional Infrastructure (II) award supports the creation of <strong>new (II-NEW)</strong> CISE research infrastructure or the <strong>enhancement (II-EN)</strong> of existing CISE research infrastructure. The proposed research infrastructure must enable compelling new research opportunities <strong><em>for the proposing PI or team of PIs and associated students and collaborators</em></strong> (i.e., for individuals at the awardee and collaborating institutions). II proposals involving multiple investigators from one or more departments and/or institutions are welcome. Projects must include substantial involvement of CISE researchers and enable projects with a <strong>clear research focus</strong> related to the core CISE disciplines. II proposals that are led by or include 2-year, predominantly undergraduate, and/or minority-serving institutions are especially encouraged. II proposals may request up to $1 million total for project durations not to exceed 3 years.</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Community Infrastructure</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each Community Infrastructure (CI) award supports:</p>
          <ul>
         <li> <strong>planning (CI-P)</strong> for CISE community research infrastructure, </li>
         <li><strong>creation</strong> <strong>of new (CI-NEW)</strong> CISE research infrastructure, </li>
       <li><strong>enhancement of existing (CI-EN)</strong> CISE research infrastructure, or</li>
         <li> <strong>sustainment of existing (CI-SUSTAIN)</strong> CISE research infrastructure for the long term,</li></ul>
          <p>in order to provide compelling new research opportunities <strong><em>for a broad-based community of CISE researchers that extends well beyond the awardee institution(s)</em>.</strong> Furthermore, each CI award may support the operation of such infrastructure, ensuring that the awardee institution(s) is well positioned to provide a high quality of service to CISE community researchers expected to use the infrastructure to realize their research goals. CI projects should include a vision for future long-term community sustainability and operation of the infrastructure. Projects must include substantial involvement of CISE researchers and enable a <strong>focused research agenda</strong> related to the core CISE disciplines. CI proposals must provide compelling evidence that a diverse community of investigators will find the proposed infrastructure valuable to their research endeavors.</p>
          <p>Support for CI projects is provided in four award categories:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>CI Planning (CI-P): Will fund grants of up to $100,000 for durations of up to 1.5 years to prepare for the submission of a CI-NEW or CI-EN proposal; and </li>
            <li>CI New (CI-NEW): Will fund grants of up to $2.5 million for durations of up to 3 years to create new CISE research infrastructure (NSF will provide no more than $250,000 per year for operating the infrastructure);</li>
            <li>CI Enhancement (CI-EN): Will fund grants of up to $2.5 million for durations of up to 3 years to enhance existing CISE research infrastructure (NSF will provide no more than $250,000 per year for operating the infrastructure); and</li>
            <li>CI Sustainability (CI-SUSTAIN): Will fund grants of up to $1 million for durations of up to 3 years to provide, for an existing infrastructure that is of value to the community, resources for (a) continued operation and (b) the implementation of a credible plan for achieving community sustainability at the end of the 3 years of funding  (NSF will provide no more than $250,000 per year for operating the infrastructure). Projects that have received prior CI-EN awards (or legacy awards such as CI-ADDO-EN) must use this route for continued CRI funding. Resources that receive a CI-SUSTAIN award are not eligible for any future funding from the CRI program.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Organizations may submit CI-NEW and CI-EN proposals without having previously received CI-P grants. However, it is often the case that CI-NEW proposals benefit from a significant planning activity, often via a CI-P award. In particular, investigators considering new CI projects should ensure that their proposed projects are sufficiently well-developed and based on prototypes or preliminary investigations. </p>
          <p>The receipt of a CI-P grant does not guarantee support for a subsequent CI-NEW or CI-EN proposal.</p>
          <p>Projects that involve enhancements of either institutional or community infrastructure must show clear evidence of:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Success of the initial implementation; </li>
            <li>Usage by a diverse population of CISE researchers; </li>
            <li>Need for and benefits of the enhancement; and </li>
            <li>CISE community support for the enhancement. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Successful CISE Research Infrastructure projects often:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Provide infrastructure that enables research with a <strong>clear intellectual focus</strong> related to the CISE core disciplines that the three participating CISE divisions support. A clear research agenda that is enabled by the implementation of the infrastructure is the central element of a successful CRI project. In particular, each CRI project demonstrates a clearly focused research agenda associated with a group of research faculty with expertise in the particular CISE sub-disciplinary focus area.  </li>
            <li>Involve participation by a group of CISE-focused researchers and leadership by CISE discipline researchers. Projects may enable other faculty and interdisciplinary groups, but clear CISE participation, involvement, and interest in the research is essential. </li>
            <li>Enable innovative CISE research that is not possible without the infrastructure and that support emerging CISE research frontiers. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>While educational benefits and outreach to a diverse group of researchers are also desirable elements of successful projects, projects that do not enable CISE disciplinary research are not responsive to the CRI solicitation. The primary motivations and outcomes from CRI funding must be related to potential research outcomes rather than potential educational benefits.</p>
          <p>The CISE Research Infrastructure program is a special program offered by the CISE Directorate to focus on the unique infrastructure needs of CISE disciplinary researchers. CRI is about enabling change and transformative research in CISE core disciplines. CRI does not typically support upgrades of university computing facilities or infrastructure for groups that are primarily made up of non-CISE researchers. </p>
          
          <p>CRI seeks projects that support a focused research agenda related to the CISE core disciplines; the focus must be clear and not simply computer science broadly across a range of disciplines. The emergence of Big Data and its involvement in research is now driving the need to upgrade and enhance infrastructure at many institutions. CRI needs to invest wisely in such infrastructure and support those projects that enable a compelling and focused research agenda related to Big Data and any associated data science methodologies. CRI proposals that are based on Big Data as the underlying research driver for the infrastructure must clearly describe a more focused research agenda related to specific types of Big Data and detail the Big Data to which the researchers involved in the associated research projects have access or reasonably expect to have access if the infrastructure is developed, enhanced, or sustained. </p>
          
          <p>Likewise, the past years have seen the emergence of a number of community resources and testbeds funded through CRI, NSF, and other sources to support CISE research. For example, cloud computing resources such as NSF Future Cloud as well as the collection of cloud resources now available beyond those supported by NSF offer excellent opportunities for investigations and data management that do not require significant additional infrastructure investments. Researchers should first consider use of currently available resources before submitting a CRI proposal. All CRI proposals must clearly demonstrate that the requirements of the proposed research agenda demand the new or enhanced infrastructure requested in the CRI proposal and cannot be accomplished using other existing resources.
          </p>
    
          <p>Since CRI does not typically support researchers in other disciplines who are simply employing existing computing and computational science approaches in their research, these researchers might look to infrastructure programs in their related NSF Directorate for possible support. Other NSF infrastructure programs that might be appropriate include: those offered by CISE's Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) such as <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=504748&amp;ods_key=nsf13530">Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Data, Networking, and Innovation Program (CC*DNI)</a>, and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=503489&amp;ods_key=nsf13511">Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation &ndash; S2I2 (SI2-S2I2)</a>, as well as the NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=5260&amp;ods_key=nsf13517">Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)</a> program.</p>

          V. PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
        </h3>
        <h4>
          A. Proposal Preparation Instructions
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Preliminary Proposals <em>(required)</em></strong>: Preliminary proposals are required and must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system, even if full proposals will be submitted via Grants.gov.</p>
        <p>Submitters will receive feedback from program staff indicating either <strong>encourage</strong> or <strong>discourage</strong>. An <strong>encourage</strong> finding generally indicates that the proposal appears to be responsive to the CRI program guidelines and is a candidate for further development relative to the CRI solicitation. A <strong>discourage</strong> finding generally indicates that the project is typically not responsive to the CRI program, is more suited to another NSF opportunity, or has serious conceptual flaws that would not benefit from further development as a CRI submission. The feedback provided pursuant to the preliminary proposal is advisory only; submitters of both &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; and &ldquo;discouraged&rdquo; preliminary proposals are eligible to submit full proposals.  </p>
        <p>Submission of a Preliminary Proposal is required to be eligible to submit a Full Proposal.  Preliminary proposals must be submitted, via FastLane, by 5 p.m. proposer's local time on the due date for preliminary proposals.</p>
        <p>Preliminary proposals are started in the same way as new full proposals.  </p>
        <ul>
       <li>Proposers must be sure to check the box &ldquo;If this is a preliminary proposal then check here&rdquo; in the middle of the cover sheet.  </li></ul>
        <p>This box appears on the cover sheet template just under the section labeled &ldquo;Previous NSF Award.&rdquo;  Check the box to indicate that you are submitting a preliminary proposal and then submit the three pieces (cover sheet, project description, and one biographical sketch) as detailed below.</p>
        <p><strong>For collaborative projects, a single preliminary proposal should be submitted by the lead institution </strong><strong>only</strong><strong>.</strong> The collaborative partners should be indicated in the Collaborative Partners section of the preliminary proposal as described below.</p>
        
        <p>Required components of the preliminary proposal are given below. Page limitations given here will be strictly enforced. Proposers should review the most current NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Grant Proposal Guide</em></a> (GPG) for specific information on signatures and format for the required sections.  </p>
        <p>The preliminary proposal should consist of three elements: cover sheet, project description, and bio-sketch.  No other sections are required or should be included in the preliminary proposal.: </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cover Sheet.</strong> The PI and all Co-PIs should be indicated. The budget indicated on the Cover Sheet should be the overall project budget total including all collaborative pieces. The Project Title on the Cover Sheet should begin with <strong>CRI Pre-proposal:</strong>, followed by the acronym for the CRI project type (<strong>II-New</strong>, <strong>II-EN</strong>, <strong>CI-P</strong>, <strong>CI-New</strong>, <strong>CI-EN</strong>, or <strong>CI-SUSTAIN</strong>), followed by a colon, followed by the project title.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Project Description (2-page limit).</strong> Start the Project Description with:</li>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>Project title;</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Project type </strong>(II-New, II-EN, CI-P, CI-New, CI-EN, or CI-SUSTAIN)<strong>;</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Collaborative partners:</strong> All collaborative partners should be identified, including PIs and Co-PIs of the collaborative partners with their institutional and departmental affiliations; </li>
              <li><strong>CISE core division</strong> (CCF, CNS, IIS) most relevant for the submission &ndash; the CISE division the proposal will be submitted to; and</li>
              <li><strong>Three keyword descriptors</strong> for the research focus that the requested infrastructure will enable.</li>
            </ul>
       
    
        <p>The Project Description should then have the following clearly labeled sections:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li> <strong>A concise description of the infrastructure to be developed, enhanced, or sustained. </strong>This includes a description of major equipment needs for the project as well as other significant costs. Projects that involve enhancements to, or sustainment of, existing infrastructures should include information about the existing resources.</li>
      
       <li><strong>The CISE Research Focus. </strong>This section describes the research focus that is enabled by the infrastructure, the importance of the research problems to advancing CISE research frontiers, and the expertise of the research team relative to the focused research thrust. The description should identify the project team and detail each member&rsquo;s contributions to the project as well as specific expertise relative to the proposed focused research agenda. Note that Big Data and computational science across a variety of disciplines need more specific research focus descriptions including the specific data that are involved and available and the specific research goals that advance computational science, respectively, as opposed to simply employing Big Data and computational science techniques in a broad range of applications.</li> 
 
      
   <li><strong>Sample research project</strong>. A short (2-3 sentences) summary of one potential research project should be included. </li>
     
       <li> <strong>The nature of the community involvement (required for CI-P, CI-New, CI-EN, or CI-SUSTAIN projects).</strong> This section demonstrates the community involvement in the creation, enhancement, evaluation, and use of the resource. Describe the research community involved in the project. CI-New projects should show the community involvement and demand for the project as well as indicate the community commitment to establishing and using the infrastructure. CI-EN and CI-SUSTAIN projects should describe community usage of the infrastructure as well as community involvement in enhancement and sustainment efforts.
   </li>
     <li> <strong>The relevance to CISE.</strong> This section should include:</li>
     
       <ul type="disc">
          <li>A list of specific CISE researchers who are involved in the leadership of the project and in the development of the infrastructure (including any enhancement or sustainment plan, as appropriate);</li>
          <li>A list of the CISE researchers communities that will benefit from the infrastructure; and</li>
              <li>A list of any prior CISE funding the infrastructure has received (enhancement projects should also include the approximate date when the infrastructure involved was established).</li></ul></ol>
 
        <li><strong>Biographical Sketch (2-page limit)</strong>. A biographical sketch is required for the PI on the proposal or on the lead proposal for collaborative projects.</li></ol>

        <p><strong>The following supplements guidance found in the GPG and/or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Proposal Titles:</strong> Proposal titles must begin with an acronym that indicates the type of CRI proposal being submitted. Select an acronym from the following list:</p>
        <p><strong>II-NEW:</strong> Institutional Infrastructure proposals requesting support for new CISE research infrastructure;</p>
        <p><strong>II-EN</strong>: Institutional Infrastructure proposals requesting support to enhance existing CISE research infrastructure;</p>

        <p>The CRI program funds the development and implementation of CISE-centric research infrastructure. CRI does not fund the associated research that is subsequently enabled by the infrastructure. Typically CRI provides at most modest funds for faculty directly related to faculty involvement in the development and implementation of the infrastructure. Likewise CRI only supports funds for graduate students and other technical support essential to the development of the infrastructure. Projects requesting graduate student support should request limited, if any, faculty support as needed to establish the infrastructure. Any proposal requesting direct student support in operations and maintenance or development efforts must justify that involvement in terms of both project needs and the training of the next generation of instrumentalists (reviewers will be asked to evaluate the appropriateness of this type of involvement). Modest operational funds may be included for community infrastructure. Universities must assume operational costs for institutional infrastructure and demonstrate a clear commitment and plan to maintain and operate the infrastructure after the end of the CRI funding.</p>
        <p><strong>For II and CI projects, the CRI program supports:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>The acquisition and/or development of new software tools, equipment, testbeds, resources, platforms, etc.; </li>
          <li>The enhancement (through acquisition and/or development) of existing software tools, equipment, testbeds, resources, platforms, etc.; </li>
          <li>Travel expenses necessary for coordination of multi-institutional projects; </li>
          <li>Technical personnel essential to the successful design, acquisition, development, and deployment of the proposed research infrastructure; and </li>
          <li>Postdocs, graduate and/or undergraduate students to participate in the design, acquisition and/or development of the proposed research infrastructure. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For CI projects ONLY, CRI supports:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Professional staff critical to the operation of the infrastructure, including providing effective user support; </li>
          <li>Postdocs, graduate and/or undergraduate students to participate in the operation and assessment of the infrastructure as long as these activities do <em>not </em>constitute research; </li>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>Within the context of the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria, reviewers will be asked to consider the following issues when preparing their reviews: </p>
        <p><strong>For Institutional Infrastructure (II) proposals:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that the proposed infrastructure will result in compelling new CISE research and education opportunities? </li>
          <li>How well does the proposed research focus fit with CISE core disciplines? Are CISE researchers involved in an integral way, particularly in leadership positions? </li>
          <li>Does the proposal provide plans for use by a diverse group of researchers? </li>
          <li>Does the proposing institution(s) provide a convincing case of their commitment to maintain and operate the infrastructure for its useful life? </li>
          <li>Is the project management plan, including timeline, costs, and personnel, realistic?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Community Infrastructure Planning (CI-P) proposals:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that the proposed infrastructure will result in compelling new CISE research and education opportunities? </li>
          <li>How well does the proposed research focus that the infrastructure enables fit with CISE core disciplines? Are CISE researchers involved in an integral way in the CRI project, particularly in leadership positions? </li>
          <li>Does the proposal provide evidence of community need for the infrastructure as well as community involvement in the design and implementation of the infrastructure? </li>
          <li>Is there clear evidence that the new infrastructure or the enhanced infrastructure meets the needs of the community that is involved and that the community supports the development of the infrastructure? Has any existing infrastructure been used successfully by the community, particularly CISE researchers? </li>
          <li>Is there a sound project management plan, including timeline and personnel? </li>
          <li>Is the planning focused around preparation for a full infrastructure implementation and submission of a future CI-New or CI-EN proposal?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Community Infrastructure NEW (CI-New) and Community Infrastructure Enhancement (CI-EN) proposals:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that the research infrastructure will result in compelling new research and education opportunities? </li>

          <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a diverse community of users plans to use the capabilities provided? </li>
          <li>Is there existing similar infrastructure that is available to the community? How is this infrastructure different, and is development of the new infrastructure or enhancement of the existing infrastructure justified with respect to other existing infrastructure available to the community? </li>
          <li>Have the PIs convincingly demonstrated that the project team has the skills necessary to acquire, develop, and/or operate community research infrastructure so as to provide a high level of service and support for a broadly-based community of users? </li>
          <li>Is the project management plan, including timeline, costs, and personnel, realistic? </li>
          <li>To what extent does the proposal convincingly describe the means by which user satisfaction will be evaluated and used to refine and improve subsequent infrastructure services and operations? </li>
          <li>If the proposal is for new community infrastructure, has the team demonstrated community support for the infrastructure and plans for community involvement in the development and future use of the infrastructure? </li>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
