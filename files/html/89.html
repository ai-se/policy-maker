        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Cities and communities in the U.S. and around the world are entering a new era of transformational change, in which their inhabitants and the surrounding built and natural environments are increasingly connected by smart technologies, leading to new opportunities for innovation, improved services, and enhanced quality of life. The goal of this Smart &amp; Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) solicitation is to support strongly interdisciplinary, integrative research and research capacity-building activities that will improve understanding of smart and connected communities and lead to discoveries that enable sustainable change to enhance community functioning. Unless stated otherwise, for the purposes of this year&rsquo;s solicitation, communities are physical, geographically-defined entities, such as towns, cities, or incorporated rural areas, consisting of various populations, with a governance structure and the ability to engage in meaningful ways with the proposed research.</p>
            <p><strong>Successful S&amp;CC projects are expected to pursue research and research capacity-building activities that integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives and undertake meaningful community engagement, </strong>and to include appropriate and robust evaluation plans for assessing activities and outcomes.  To meet the multidisciplinary criterion, proposals must meaningfully integrate across both social and technological research dimensions.  In this solicitation, the social dimensions reflect areas typically included in the portfolios of the NSF&rsquo;s Directorates for Social, Behavior, and Economic Sciences (SBE) and Education and Human Resources (EHR), while the technological dimensions reflect disciplinary areas typically included in the portfolios of the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Engineering (ENG). Proposals may also pursue integration with other disciplines as needed, including but not limited to those typically encompassed in the portfolio of the NSF&rsquo;s Directorate for Geosciences (GEO). Successful proposals are also expected to include appropriate community engagement as defined further in the solicitation.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Cities and communities in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are entering a new era of transformational change, in which their inhabitants and the surrounding built and natural environments are increasingly connected by smart technologies. Concurrently, communities continue to undergo substantial changes. Some of those changes lead to new opportunities for innovation. Some are highly disruptive. There are unique opportunities to advance the frontiers of fundamental science as population demographics shift, new technologies and methods for delivering services come into being, and environmental changes continue.</p>
          <p>The goal of this Smart &amp; Connected Communities solicitation is to support interdisciplinary and integrative research and research capacity-building activities, while undertaking meaningful community engagement. The specific objectives of this solicitation are to: (1) enhance understanding and support the design of smart and connected communities, in ways that improve the quality of life within them; (2) foster the development of a robust, multidisciplinary and diverse research community that encompasses, integrates, and extends disciplinary perspectives in the social, behavioral, economic, and learning sciences and in computer and information sciences and engineering, and engineering research; and (3) support research capacity-building to address the challenges and opportunities of present and future smart and connected communities.  The solicitation calls for activities that contribute to meaningful engagement with communities in accomplishing the above objectives.</p>
          <p>NSF has long been a leader in supporting the basic research and education activities and partnerships that form the foundation for the Smart &amp; Connected Communities program. Some basic research and education areas that form the foundations for this S&amp;CC program solicitation include: (1) new methods and technologies for collecting, managing, and analyzing ever-finer and more diverse data and new algorithms that can leverage those data for a wide range of phenomena in urban, suburban, and rural settings; (2) new approaches in the modeling and design of complex sociotechnical systems to inform the construction, instrumentation, and performance of smart and connected communities; (3) research on the dynamics, characteristics, and behaviors of individuals and communities; and (4) development of new methods and advanced technologies that support education and workforce development. Looking forward, NSF seeks research and research capacity-building efforts that span and integrate across multiple disciplines and that meaningfully engage with communities themselves.</p>
          <p>This S&amp;CC solicitation is part of NSF&rsquo;s multipronged strategy for investing in basic research on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/scc/">Smart &amp; Connected Communities</a>, and is aligned with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help">White House Smart Cities Initiative</a>. Subject to the availability of funds, NSF envisions a multi-year S&amp;CC program, with activities that evolve to support fundamental research, research community capacity-building, and community engagement.</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p><strong>A. Overview</strong></p>
          <p>This solicitation calls for integrative research and research capacity-building that, when undertaken with meaningful community engagement, will secure far-reaching impacts in physical, geographically-defined communities often consisting of diverse, and varied populations. Generally, smart and connected communities are those that integrate people and information, communication, engineering and other technologies to improve the quality of life for those who live, travel, and work in them. Smart and connected communities can be considered systems of systems: physical, social, and technical. This solicitation seeks fundamental, multidisciplinary advances in understanding and designing smart and connected communities. To support the expansion and development of the S&amp;CC research community, it also calls for projects that seek to build or leverage research capacity across a wide variety of disciplinary areas. As a third component of this solicitation, meaningful community engagement will help frame the research directions, provide access to input for such research, and provide means of understanding the results that emerge from such research efforts. Unless stated otherwise, for the purpose of this year&rsquo;s solicitation, <strong>communities </strong>are physical, geographically-defined entities, such as towns, cities, or incorporated rural areas, often consisting of various populations, with a governance structure and an ability to engage in meaningful ways with the proposed research.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Components</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>Integrative research </em></strong>encompasses innovation that addresses combined social and technological aspects of smart and connected communities. Among the social considerations that could result from pursuing an &ldquo;integrative research&rdquo; approach are improved understanding of the attitudes, behaviors, and other characteristics of community inhabitants, groups and organizations within the community, and relationships with other communities or the larger environment and institutions; processes of learning, adaptation, interaction, and collaboration; economic impacts on the community; and future opportunities for growth. Among the technological considerations that could result from taking an &ldquo;integrative research&rdquo; approach are data integration and management; new algorithms and modeling frameworks for understanding and exploiting high volumes of diverse and complex data; security and privacy; and innovations in the design and engineering of materials, sensors, structures, and systems in support of smart and connected communities, and improving quality of life therein. From an integrative perspective, these considerations must be explored in concert, taking into account opportunities, vulnerabilities, and possible unintended consequences of distributed, intelligent technologies embedded within communities. Illustrative integrative research topics include but are not limited to the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collection, analysis, and innovative uses of data and information from multiple heterogeneous sources to support communities in identifying economically viable and sustainable options to improve quality of life;</li>
            <li>Real-time adaptation of systems and infrastructure in response to changing needs and behaviors of the community by harnessing and autonomously handling data;</li>
            <li>Social, cultural, legal, and ethical drivers and consequences, including potential unintended consequences, of smart and connected technologies and infrastructures. For example, factors that affect technology adoption, which may include privacy and autonomy considerations;</li>
            <li>Infrastructure retrofit and design through advances in systems science and engineering, and in light of broader social changes in the attitudes, behaviors, and demographics of the community;</li>
            <li>New approaches and methods for data-driven and/or physics-based analysis and engineering of S&amp;CC systems, while considering broader social and cultural perspectives;</li>
            <li>Novel methodologies, algorithms and representations for systems engineering as applied to the design, integration, operation, and maintenance of S&amp;CC systems, considering how community inhabitants identify, evaluate, adapt to, and incorporate smart technologies;</li>
            <li>Novel computing technologies, and advances in theories of learning, that enable cyber-learning with consideration of distributed intelligence, knowledge-building communities, formal or informal educational environments, knowledge management, and communities of practice for a future diverse and innovative workforce;</li>
            <li>New technologies for improving public safety and security, including management of risks associated with highly complex infrastructures and systems, mindful of the needs and attitudes of inhabitants and legal and policy constraints;</li>
            <li>Fundamental research in sensing/estimation and information-theory, cooperative control, game theory applied to and influenced by smart and connected communities and their members;</li>
            <li>Improved understanding of interdependencies and the role of, automation and autonomy within complex, dynamic, S&amp;CC systems; and</li>
            <li>Advances in machine learning and data analytics, emphasizing dynamic optimization under uncertainty for human-in-the-loop decision making in smart and connected communities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Integrative research may cross a range of <strong>application </strong>domains, including but not limited to economic development, education and learning, energy, environmental quality, health and healthcare, safety, social services, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, proposals may explore additional issues lying outside the identified integrative research topics and applications. For example, S&amp;CC research may also involve integration with the physical and environmental sciences, urban planning, or other fields.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Research capacity-building </em></strong>refers to activities that further develop the interdisciplinary teams and team members that can contribute to research and applications for smart and connected communities, whether by developing plans for future research efforts and directions or in the activation of collaborations or networks to link new and ongoing efforts in novel ways. The ultimate goal of research capacity-building is to develop and attract research talent to address S&amp;CC integrative research challenges through training, collaborations, networks, seminars, or other approaches. Such activities should be organized around strongly multidisciplinary, integrative theme(s) such as those described above, and with close community engagement.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Community engagement </em></strong>is an essential component of both integrative research and research capacity-building. Here, community engagement refers to substantive interaction with individuals, institutions, and other organizations in target communities as defined above. Examples of community partner organizations and anchor institutions in the public, private and not-for profit sectors include but are not limited to governments, government departments, schools, libraries, health and social service providers, non-profits, cultural organizations, and businesses.  Investigators and community partners are encouraged to work closely to develop and evaluate creative approaches to achieving meaningful engagement for mutual benefit. Examples of community engagement include but are not limited to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Refining the conceptual framework of the research or defining community member needs and concerns;</li>
            <li>Providing facilities, resources, and/or expertise that are instrumental to enhancing community functioning;</li>
            <li>Identifying or supplying data and enabling the interface of that data with the proposers&rsquo; research ideas;</li>
            <li>Conceiving of or supporting research demonstrations, experimentation, proof of concepts and/or pilot projects by enabling use of infrastructure or community services;</li>
            <li>Participating in &ldquo;living labs&rdquo; where science, technology, and engineering advances are staged iteratively through pilot studies in communities;</li>
            <li>Assisting in the planning for or actual evaluation of proposed research, including helping to define or create metrics and support data collection and/or interpretation within the community context; and</li>
            <li>Engaging or helping to define, discover, or contact other potential stakeholders. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note, the nature of the engagement will vary for the proposal mechanisms identified below: for Planning Grants and Research Coordination Networks (RCNs), community engagement should contribute to planning and establishing research direction setting, whereas for Integrative Research Grants (IRGs), the community engagement is expected to be more substantive as described below.</p>
          <p><strong>C. Proposal Categories</strong></p>
          <p>This S&amp;CC solicitation will support research projects in four categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Integrative Research Grants (IRGs) Track 1.</strong> Awards in this category will support the conduct of fundamental, multidisciplinary, integrative research and the building of research capacity. Track 1 awards will provide three to five years of support for projects at a level not to exceed $5,000,000 for the total budget.</li>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Integrative Research Grants Track 2.</strong> Awards in this category will support the conduct of fundamental, multidisciplinary, integrative research and the building of research capacity. Track 2 awards will provide three or four years of support for projects at a level not to exceed $1,000,000 for the total budget. It is anticipated that Track 1 and 2 proposals will be distinguished by the sizes of the teams, as well as, the scope and duration of the proposed activities.</li>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). </strong>Awards in this category support the establishment of a network of multidisciplinary researchers and others who will collectively and significantly advance S&amp;CC research through active exchange of ideas, development of fundamental research directions, and other approaches. Each of these awards will provide four or five years of support for projects at a level not to exceed $500,000 for the total budget.</li>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Planning Grants.</strong> Awards in this category will provide one year of support to stimulate research capacity through multidisciplinary team-building and the development of high-impact, fundamental research concepts. Each of these awards will be at a level not to exceed $100,000 for the total budget.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In each of these categories, <strong>successful proposals </strong>will reflect integrative, multidisciplinary research, tangible research capacity-building, and meaningful community engagement, the nature of which will vary by the proposal category.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>S&amp;CC Integrative Research Grants (IRGs) Tracks 1 and 2: </strong>S&amp;CC IRGs should pursue a visionary and transformative research agenda addressing fundamental, integrative research challenges underpinning future S&amp;CC. While projects may focus on advances across multiple application domains, all proposals should take a holistic and integrative approach to addressing research problems central to understanding, adapting to, and developing S&amp;CC systems, both from social and technological perspectives. IRG projects must also describe activities directed at building research capacity, namely activities to develop or attract research talent to address S&amp;CC integrative research challenges. IRG projects are expected to involve and demonstrate substantive community engagement. NSF anticipates having a project kickoff meeting within 90 days of the award issuance during which awardees will present their research plans, steps for community engagement, and overall integration and coordination strategies. <strong>The ultimate goal of an S&amp;CC IRG is to develop integrative research understanding in aspects of S&amp;CC meaningful to communities, and by example point the broader research community toward S&amp;CC research frontiers.</strong></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Research Coordination Networks: </strong>S&amp;CC RCN awards are intended to significantly advance the S&amp;CC field or create new directions in research by supporting groups of investigators to communicate and coordinate their research, training, and educational activities across disciplinary, organizational, and geographical boundaries. Although an S&amp;CC RCN should support neither planning nor conduct of individual research projects, it should engage in activities that will facilitate future fundamental research across scientific communities. The activities S&amp;CC RCN awards support are the means by which investigators foster synthesis and new collaborations, and communicate and share information and ideas, including advances in science, engineering, and education. S&amp;CC RCN awards are not meant to support existing activities of established collaborations. Areas of interest may include, but are not limited to, novel participant networking strategies, collaborative technologies for interdisciplinary or distributed work, and research community standards for data and meta-data. <strong>The ultimate goal of the S&amp;CC RCN is to nurture and grow the S&amp;CC research and education ecosystem, cultivate new research directions in this area and/or otherwise advance the field through communication and sharing of ideas.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-left: 60px;">More information about the RCN concept and mechanism can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15527/nsf15527.htm">NSF 15-527</a>. Given the special nature of this S&amp;CC program solicitation, please follow the instructions in this solicitation to prepare an S&amp;CC RCN application. In particular, an S&amp;CC RCN proposal will need to address how community engagement will inform the activities of the RCN (see discussion and examples above about Community Engagement). In addition, the S&amp;CC RCN proposal needs to describe how it will build research capacity.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>S&amp;CC Planning Grants: </strong>S&amp;CC Planning Grants are supported in order to build multidisciplinary research teams that will engage community stakeholders to develop a holistically integrated fundamental S&amp;CC research concept. Research concepts must align with the definition of Integrative Research outlined above in the Program Description. Proposals must present a description of the fundamental, integrative research concept along with a strategy for developing this concept.  This strategy may include, but is not limited to, identifying academic collaborators, building partnerships with appropriate community stakeholders, planning regular interactions with the team or cross-training of students, and exploring the unique needs of the community.  Planning grants must address how local community engagement will inform the planning activities (see discussion and examples above about community engagement). Planning grants are not meant to support research on the proposed concepts. <strong>The ultimate goal of an S&amp;CC Planning Grants is to stimulate and enable a future high-impact project that can contribute to the S&amp;CC vision.  Note that future program commitments will depend on the availability of funds.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>D. Principal Investigator Meetings</strong></p>
          <p>In order to accelerate the rate of dissemination of ideas among researchers, to build an intellectual research core to address S&amp;CC challenges, and to enable enhanced research collaborations, the S&amp;CC program plans to host principal investigator (PI) meetings every year with participation from all funded projects and other representatives from academia, industry, government, and community organizations. Principal investigators <strong>must</strong> participate in these PI meetings throughout the duration of the award. For multi-institution projects, investigators from each collaborating institution are expected to participate. A substitute project representative may be designated to attend a PI meeting, but only with prior approval from an NSF Program Officer. As noted in &ldquo;Budget Preparation Instructions," budgets for all projects must include funding for one or more designated S&amp;CC project representatives (PI/co-PI/senior personnel or NSF-approved replacement) to attend each S&amp;CC PI meeting during the proposed lifetime of the award.</p>

        <h3>
          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
 
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
          <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
     
        <p>As appropriate to the category, how effectively does the proposal address <em>integrative research</em> and <em>research capacity-building</em> coupled with <em>community engagement?</em></p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>For every S&amp;CC award, one or more designated project representatives (PI/co-PI/senior personnel or NSF-approved replacement) must attend annual S&amp;CC PI meetings throughout the duration of the grant.</p>
        <p>As a condition of every S&amp;CC award, the grantee agrees to submit requested project data for the purpose of program evaluation to an NSF third-party evaluator.</p>
        <p>Attribution of support in publications must acknowledge the National Science Foundation, the award number, and the program, by including the phrase, "as part of the NSF Smart &amp; Connected Communities Program."</p>
       <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
