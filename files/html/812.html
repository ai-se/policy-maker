		<P>In&nbsp;this solicitation, NSF and EPA are offering funds for fundamental and applied research in the physical and biological sciences and engineering that will lead to environmentally-benign methods for industrial processing/manufacturing; sustainable construction processes; and new technologies for pollution sensing and remediation. The competition addresses technological environmental issues of design, treatment, synthesis, processing, and energy conversion; environmentally conscious construction and disaster management; and the production, use, detection, and ultimate disposition of products in continuous and discrete manufacturing industries as well as in construction industries and in the environment.</P><P>There are two parts to this competition. Together they are designed to address pollution avoidance, prevention, treatment, and remediation processes and methodologies. They also support scientific and engineering research with potential long-term industrial and/or societal impacts. Under the Technology for a Sustainable Environment (TSE) part, research proposals are invited that advance the discovery, development, and use of innovative technologies and approaches to avoid or minimize the generation of pollutants at the source. In preventing pollution at its source, the life cycle of both materials and energy can also be considered. Under the New Technologies for the Environment (NTE) part, proposals are invited that explore new technologies that can be applied to environmental remediation, environmental sensing, and small drinking water systems.</P><P dir=ltr><STRONG>NEW ASPECTS</STRONG>&nbsp;of this year's NSF/EPA Solicitation</P><UL><LI>Combination of TSE and NTE into one overall solicitation with two separate deadlines<BR></LI><LI>Inclusion of <EM>Sustainable Construction Processes&nbsp;</EM>in TSE (Contact: Miriam Heller, NSF)<BR></LI><LI>Inclusion of <EM>Breakthrough Control Systems for Energy Conversion or Transportation Technologies</EM>&nbsp;under the Non-Reaction-Based Engineering portion of TSE (Contact: Paul Werbos, NSF)<BR></LI><LI>Inclusion of <EM>Environmental Sensing</EM>&nbsp;technologies in NTE (Contacts: Paul Werbos, NSF and Nick Clesceri, NSF)<BR></LI><LI><EM>Treatment Technologies for Arsenic in Small Drinking Water Systems</EM> added to NTE (Contact: April Richards, EPA) </LI></UL> </blockquote></div>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3><div class="user_input"><P><STRONG>A. TECHNOLOGY FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT (Prevention)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></P><P>As a nation, we seek long-term economic growth that creates jobs while improving and sustaining the environment and preserving economic opportunities and resources for future generations. It is increasingly clear that "end-of-pipe" pollution controls for industrial operations are not always a sufficient means of reaching these goals, nor is unconstrained development of the supporting infrastructure of industrial facilities. A new generation of cleaner industrial manufacturing, processing, and construction technologies is needed that supports pollution avoidance/prevention (at the source), efficient resource use, and industrial ecology. Such a strategy can help industries become more competitive by lowering resource and energy needs and reducing waste/emissions-control costs, thereby fostering sustainable development while maintaining a strong economy.</P><P>Besides&nbsp;addressing industrial and economic issues, more environmentally-benign TSE industrial approaches could contribute to the solution of global environmental problems by, for example, lessening the negative impacts of industrialization on the climate and the biosphere.</P><P>Research proposals are invited that advance the development and use of innovative manufacturing and processing technologies and approaches directed at avoiding or minimizing the generation of pollutants at the source. Other than those aspects that pertain to materials flows and reuse <U>within industrial processes</U>, the TSE portion (Part A) of this competition is not intended to address issues related to waste monitoring, treatment, remediation, environmental sensors (except in-process sensors), recycling or containment. These areas are very important, and they are supported by the program activities in Part B, New Technologies for the Environment, (NTE).</P><P>NSF and EPA are offering funds for fundamental and applied research in the physical sciences and engineering that will lead to the discovery, development, and evaluation of advanced and novel environmentally benign methods for industrial processing, manufacturing, and construction. The competition addresses technological environmental issues of design, synthesis, processing, and the production, use, and ultimate disposition of products in construction and in continuous and discrete manufacturing industries. Projects must employ fundamental new approaches, and address or be relevant to current national concerns for pollution avoidance/prevention (at the source). Projects that are "on the cutting edge" or are "high-risk/high-payoff" are encouraged. Projects that show the potential to change research infrastructure by developing teams, using systems approaches, and introducing new ways of conducting research will also be considered.</P><P>Answering research questions related to environmental sustainability issues often requires the analysis and evaluation of scientific and engineering information and complex phenomena over large spatial and time domains. In addition, the use of modern information technology and high-end computing resources to do this research presents exciting opportunities to the research community, and proposals using these approaches may fit in with this program. Other examples of newer research emphases that are expected to have major impacts on scientific and engineering approaches to sustainability could include nanotechnology, molecular modeling, computational chemistry, sensors, smart materials and buildings, adaptive infrastructure, and simulation of physical, biological, and chemical phenomena. Environmental technology research can also have a critical, albeit indirect, role in developing reliable and affordable alternative energy systems.</P><P>This is the seventh joint NSF/EPA solicitation of TSE. About 1,200 proposals have been submitted to the competitions, and about 13% of those (more than 156 TSE projects) were funded. Previous TSE projects were typically funded for three years at a level of about $120,000 per year.</P><P>Refer to the NSF/EPA Partnership websites for funding details and abstracts of grants: <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/tse">https://www.nsf.gov/tse</A> or <A href="http://www.epa.gov/ncer">http://www.epa.gov/ncer</A>.</P><P><STRONG>Description of Possible TSE Research Projects (PREVENTION)</STRONG></P><P>The general areas covered by this part (Part A - TSE/Prevention) of the solicitation are:</P><UL><LI>Chemistry, Bioengineering, and Chemical Reaction-Based Science and Engineering for Pollution Avoidance or Prevention;<BR></LI><LI>Non-Reaction-Based Engineering for Pollution Avoidance and Prevention;<BR></LI><LI>Environmentally Benign Systems and Design, Manufacturing, Processing, and Industrial Ecology for Sustainable Product/Services Realization; and<BR></LI><LI>Sustainable Construction Processes. </LI></UL><P><STRONG>1. Chemistry, Bioengineering, and Chemical Reaction-Based Science and Engineering for Pollution Avoidance or Prevention</STRONG></P><P>The long-range goal of this activity is to develop substances and processes that are safer, reduce health risks, and are environmentally friendly. For the chemical industry, preventing pollution at the source, or "green chemistry and engineering," involves the design of chemicals and alternative chemical processes that do not use toxic feedstocks, reagents or solvents; or processes that reduce the production of toxic by-products or co-products. Data-oriented environmental research is also invited.</P><P>Appropriate areas of investigation span the broad range of chemistry and chemical reaction-based engineering and include chemical synthesis and catalysis; computational modeling; sensor innovation (for in-process sensing); reaction mechanisms; and environmentally benign materials. Some specific examples are:</P><UL><LI><EM>Alternative Reaction Conditions:&nbsp;</EM>Development of alternative new reaction conditions, such as using solvents that are environmentally benign, developing advanced laser control of reactivity, or increasing reaction selectivity to reduce wastes and emissions.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Safer Chemicals:&nbsp;</EM>Discovery or redesign of useful chemicals and materials that are less toxic to health and the environment or safer in terms of accident potential.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Catalysis and Biocatalysis:&nbsp;</EM>Development of innovative synthetic methods using catalysis or biocatalysis, including combinatorial or self-assembly approaches; photochemical, electrochemical or biomimetic activation; or starting materials that are environmentally benign or renewable.

(NSF will not be funding reaction engineering proposals through this competition. Instead, chemical reactor design and control proposals may be submitted directly to the NSF Process and Reaction Engineering program as regular research proposals. However, EPA will still consider funding such projects via the TSE part of this solicitation.)<BR><BR></LI><LI><DIV><EM>Computational Chemistry and Molecular Simulation:&nbsp;</EM>Rapid advances in computational speed along with the development of highly efficient computational algorithms have begun to make computational chemistry and molecular simulation viable partners to experimental efforts.

Non-Reaction-Based Engineering for Pollution Avoidance and Prevention</STRONG></P><P>The focus of this program activity is to develop novel benign engineering approaches for preventing or reducing pollution from industrial manufacturing and processing activities, for non-discrete and discrete processes.

Examples include: bioprocessing to increase energy efficiency, or to develop more cost effective methods of producing environmentally benign products. Bio-remediation research is not covered by the TSE portion of this solicitation; it is covered by Part B - NTE.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Separations, Mass Transport, and Interfacial Phenomena:&nbsp;</EM>Non-reactive mass transport and interfacial processes, including novel processes for molecularly-controlled synthesis of thin films, and the use of special surfactant systems for surface cleaning and reactions. Solution thermodynamics of environmentally-benign solvents such as ionic or near critical solutions. Separation methods, such as novel cost-effective methods for the highly efficient in-process separation of useful materials from the components of the process stream (for example, field-enhanced and hybrid separation processes); separation methods that reform feedstocks for improved efficiency; and separation methods for recovering waste and other spent materials for reuse as process feedstocks.

(Combustion-related environmental research is not supported in this solicitation.)<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Breakthrough in Control Systems for Energy Conversion or Transportation Technologies:</EM> Proposals in this area should not involve incremental progress within the scope of existing funding programs elsewhere. Examples might include the use of new methods in intelligent control to reduce NOx fifty percent beyond what seems achievable with conventional methods, or new categories of energy conversion system relevant to distributed generation and non-hydrocarbon transportation systems. (This research area generally relates to electrical power and control systems; however, the representative from the NSF/ECS division should be consulted as to program priority interests.) </LI></UL><P>Research related to flow stream recycle and process modification or improvement inside the industrial plant is acceptable in this section. Research involving recycle of materials from outside the industrial plant boundaries is not acceptable in this section.</P><P><STRONG>3. Environmentally Benign Systems and Design, Manufacturing, Processing, and Industrial Ecology for Sustainable Product/Services Realization</STRONG></P><P>Industrial ecology requires that an industrial system be viewed not in isolation from its surrounding systems, but in concert with them. An assessment of global manufacturing demonstrates the need for research on environmentally benign manufacturing/processing and re-manufacturing of materials and products, with particular emphasis on the connectivity within industrial ecology. The systems view requires the approach by which one seeks to optimize the total materials life cycle from extraction, processing, design, and manufacture of product, through use and re-manufacture, to recycling and ultimate disposal. Factors to be optimized include resources, energy and capital.</P><P>Potential research topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</P><UL><LI><EM>Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA):&nbsp;</EM>Innovative methodologies for streamlined and targeted life-cycle assessment and analysis, including product use interactions with the environment and impact prioritization models. Examples include: thermodynamic basis for LCA; strategic metals extraction, usage and capture; cradle-to-grave budgets and cycles; material and energy tradeoffs/balances.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Green Design and Materials Cycles:&nbsp;</EM>Environmentally benign product design methodologies, considering the entire life cycle for the materials employed in the production, use, and disposal of products. Examples include: decision-making tools for design based on scientifically sound principles requiring less comprehensive data inputs; re-manufacturing and refurbishing methods and tools including those that evaluate the impact of product use and multi-life cycles; material and energy flows studies ("industrial metabolism"); design for disassembly, reuse, recycling and re-manufacturing.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Environmentally Benign Manufacturing:</EM> Research in creating new or modifying current manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts while also considering manufacturing competitiveness. This includes process design for material and energy minimization and indirect as well as direct impacts of manufacturing over the life cycle. Examples include: novel joining/welding processes that render fumes harmless and/or lead to enhanced disassembly/separation; novel benign hybrid additive/subtractive processing that improves energy and material use efficiency; reduction of contaminant and sludge generation in processes such as electrochemical machining; modified foundry approaches that reduce or reuse current waste streams; novel hybrid processes including plasma or beam processing that create functionality without the addition of new material constituents; dry or controlled environment machining; and nanomanufacturing that addresses pollution prevention or remanufacturing. </LI></UL><P><STRONG>4. Sustainable Construction Processes</STRONG></P><P>The built environment provides services that sustain our economy and way of life, though at the cost of heavy resource use and waste generation. In 1997, about 80% of all materials, by volume, were used by the construction industry. Buildings over the course of their life-cycle account for 17% of fresh water withdrawals, 25% of wood harvest, 40% of materials use, 54% of energy used, and 50% of fossil fuels consumed. The construction phase of U.S. commercial buildings alone generates on average 740 million tons of carbon dioxide, 25% of CFC emissions, and 8-20% of all solid waste annually. Many environmental consequences of the built environment, namely buildings, are already being addressed. For instance, the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have active programs dealing with the energy use and materials problems of building design and operations.</P><P>Environmental issues that extend beyond the building envelope to encompass the construction site and neighboring areas are now ripe for investigation. Specifically, the resources used and wastes generated at the construction site over the life of the project should be defined and eventually integrated with life-cycle metrics of the facilities themselves. As we move from traditional design and construction engineering and management toward environmentally-conscious construction, new tools and types of service will be needed to effectively and efficiently optimize construction processes and materials, reduce design errors and omissions and construction defects, meet the users needs, reduce resource requirements, and reduce the environmental burdens associated with construction projects. New processes and material options must then be evaluated on the basis of the economic goals of the industry and concerns for global competitiveness.</P><P>Proposals in this section (Section A. 4) will be funded by NSF only. Please contact the program directors for topic interest and funds availability&nbsp;before submission.</P><P>Research in the following two areas is solicited:</P><UL><LI><EM>Environmentally Conscious Construction Processes:&nbsp;</EM>Construction can constitute a very large-scale project of relatively long duration. During a construction project various nonroad vehicles, engines, and equipment contribute to air quality issues as mobile sources. Examples of these are asphalt and concrete pavers, compaction, earth-moving, and excavation equipment, concrete and industrial saws, cement and mortar mixers, concrete trucks, cranes, etc. Additional construction site equipment includes generators, pumps, compressors, welders, and pressure washers. The impacts of these technologies remain largely unquantified. Precipitation and construction-process water transport other construction wastes, such as sealants, adhesives, mortar, and eroded soil, without being subject to full accounting. Scrap and other solid wastes are regularly generated and planned for, but design errors and omissions as well as defects during construction processes occur frequently, increasing both material use and waste. The full impact of construction work requires characterization, quantification, and improvement through:<BR><BR><UL><LI><EM>Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA):&nbsp;</EM>Adapted and new methodologies for life-cycle assessment and analysis of construction site operations, including interactions with the natural environment. Examples include: nonroad vehicle emissions and energy use; waste generation, transport and fate; strategic and nonrenewable materials use and extraction; cradle-to-grave budgets and cycles; material and energy tradeoffs/balances.<BR><BR></LI><LI><EM>Environmentally Benign Construction Processes:</EM>&nbsp;Research in creating new or modifying current construction processes to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts while also considering construction costs and construction competitiveness. This includes process design for material and energy minimization and indirect as well as direct impacts of construction-related decisions over the facility life cycle. Examples include: real-time sensing and monitoring of construction processes to reduce defects and the resulting additional wastes and emissions; equipment substitution, technology innovation, or energy recovery for reduced energy requirements and air emissions; novel materials handling processes that improve energy and material use efficiency; novel construction connections and reinforcement technologies that facilitate deconstruction and material reuse rather than demolition.<BR><BR></LI></UL></LI><LI><EM>Disaster Management for a More Sustainable Environment:</EM> Disaster management, often a cyclical decision-making process, offers numerous opportunities and challenges to move toward more sustainable construction and construction practices. Research is needed that links post-disaster recovery to mitigation and protection measures that will result in more sustainable built and natural environments. Pre-disaster mitigation measures also must be examined&nbsp;as they relate&nbsp;to sustainable built and natural environments. Finally, construction materials, methods, and design must be re-examined in light of their possible failure and potential concomitant environmental impact. Examples include improved understanding of the cost and benefits of structural and non-structural mitigation measures in geographies vulnerable to hazard(s); expected environmental impact of debris from building collapse, and building design for material reuse in the event of building failure. </LI></UL><P><STRONG>New Grants for Past TSE Projects: Industrial Collaboration Required</STRONG></P><P>Proposals that request new grants for continuing work on past or on-going TSE projects MUST include some form of academic-industrial collaboration, partnership or involvement.</P><P><STRONG>Additional Information</STRONG></P><P>Please refer to Section C for additional information on priorities and special proposal requirements.</P><P><STRONG>B. NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT (Remediation, Treatment, and Sensing)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></P><P>As population continues to grow, there are increased pressures on society and the ecosystem that supports it, including the global climate. Scarce resources are being depleted. Air and water pollution causes human disease, damages ecosystems, and harms organisms. Collectively, these pressures are one significant reason for human conflict. These pressures are relieved by advancing our scientific understanding of nature and the world around us, as scientific solutions&nbsp;are implemented in engineered systems. Engineered systems can cope with increased societal pressures, provide cleaner air and water, and thereby reduce risks from environmental pollutants. This provides economic benefits that enable a society to move forward, to care for its people, to provide quality education and health care, and to feed, clothe, and protect itself.</P><P>The New Technologies for the Environment program (NTE) focuses on new technologies that can be applied to environmental sensing, remediation, and treatment. The program has two parts: Phase I (exploratory feasibility studies) and Phase II (regular research). All three technology areas described below are appropriate for Phase I proposals. If a Phase I exploratory project has already been successfully completed in area 1 or area 3 (not area 2),&nbsp;the PI&nbsp;may apply for a Phase II grant in the same area. </P><P>Phase I of NTE emphasizes high-risk/high-return, exploratory feasibility studies of new technologies applied to the environment. Emphasis is placed on the novelty and potential impact of the approach. Successfully completed Phase I studies may compete for Phase II awards. A subsequent Phase II competition may be held to allow successfully completed Phase I projects to compete for Phase II funds. However, a Phase I award in the current 2003 competition does not necessarily imply that the next solicitation will include Phase II, or that Phase II projects will be funded in the future.</P><P>Refer to section III. "Eligibility Information," section IV. "Award Information," and section VI. "Proposal Review Information"&nbsp;for further details about how NTE requirements and awards&nbsp;may differ from TSE. </P><P><STRONG>Description of Possible NTE Research Projects</STRONG></P><P>Proposals submitted <STRONG>must</STRONG> focus on one or more of the following three areas of environmental technology.</P><P><STRONG>1.

Fundamental research leading to new remediation technologies in the following focus areas is of special interest: source characterization of pollutants, cost-effective separation technologies for dilute metals and liquid contaminants, heavy metals removal from incineration gases, and remediation of other gases potentially affecting global climate. Other areas may be acceptable, depending on program interests.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>2. Treatment Technologies for Arsenic in Small Drinking Water Systems</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">EPA is soliciting innovative, exploratory Phase I proposals that address the treatment of arsenic in small drinking water systems. These systems must provide low capital and operating cost, simplify operation, require minimal monitoring and maintenance, and reduce residual waste generation. EPA is particularly interested in highly innovative approaches that would be significantly less costly than current treatment approaches. Proposals on this topic should address this cost comparison issue.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Research technologies should be applicable to providing clean drinking water with less than 10 ppb arsenic in a range of systems from dispersed individual to small scale municipal (which serve less than 10,000 persons). Work may involve innovative processes including ion exchange materials, new adsorption methods, coagulation/filtration technologies, electrodialysis, novel membrane processes, reverse osmosis, and/or point of use (at the tap)/point-of-entry technologies.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">For more information regarding arsenic in drinking water: visit <A href="http://www.epa.gov/epahome/hi-arsenic.htm">http://www.epa.gov/epahome/hi-arsenic.htm</A> and <A href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/arsenic.html">http://www.epa.gov/safewater/arsenic.html</A>.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS for BOTH PROGRAMS (TSE and NTE)</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>1. Industrial-Academic, Government, and International Collaboration</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">A clearer understanding of problems and more creative solutions often result from collaboration between academic researchers and the industrial investigators who represent the eventual customers for the products of the research. Therefore, applicants are strongly encouraged to seek meaningful project collaboration with industrial partners on research issues that link fundamental and applied aspects of pollution prevention/avoidance. (Industrial collaboration is required for continuing funding of past TSE research.)&nbsp;In some cases, government agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or professional organizations may be an appropriate substitute for an industrial partner. The Appendix of the NSF General Grants Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program announcement&nbsp;(NSF 98-142, available online at <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/goali/">www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/goali/</A>)&nbsp;describes several mechanisms for these collaborations. Other mechanisms for collaboration will also be considered.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Government collaborations cannot be supported financially by this program. However, interactions of a non-financial nature are acceptable with non-EPA governmental organizations.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">This competition will also entertain proposals that include international collaborative activities, by using a variety of NSF mechanisms.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>2. Exploratory Proposals</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">NSF will accept exploratory proposals in the above technical areas at an early or proof-of-concept stage. These proposals can be prepared&nbsp;using the format found in&nbsp;NSF Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal guidelines&nbsp;(Chapter II, Section&nbsp;D1&nbsp;of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpg</A>); however, these will not be considered SGER proposals. This class of proposal will be reviewed in the same panels as regular TSE and NTE proposals. The level of support for exploratory projects will range up to $50,000 per year for one or two years. </P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">NSF may provide further support to a successful exploratory project. If the initial concept was successful, a full proposal may be submitted in response to a subsequent NSF/EPA Partnership solicitation or to a regular NSF program. <STRONG>(Please note that the NTE program <U>requires</U> successful completion of an exploratory Phase I project before entry to Phase II.)</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>3. Multidisciplinary Proposals</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Environmental problems will often cross disciplinary boundaries. This solicitation welcomes cross-disciplinary proposals that address the TSE and NTE topic areas. Proposals may be submitted by individuals or small cross-disciplinary groups of investigators from eligible institutions.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>4. Student Involvement</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Projects involving the training and education of junior scientists and engineers in academia through the research experience (both graduate and undergraduate students) are very strongly encouraged. All proposals should address the ways in which education and training are integrated within the research program. Efforts to incorporate interdisciplinary educational activities and encourage student teamwork are also encouraged.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>5. Impact of the Proposed Research</STRONG></P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">All TSE and NTE proposals <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> include a section entitled "Potential Impact". (Refer to&nbsp;Chapter II of the&nbsp;Grant Proposal Guide for detailed requirements.) This section must address the pollutants prevented or remediated by the proposed research at the process industry level (if applicable). It should address the significance of these reductions in terms of reduced risk and other benefits such as reduced energy or other raw materials usage; speculate about unintended consequences; and/or describe a life-cycle approach.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">In this section on potential impacts, it is strongly recommended that the proposer address issues such as: the pollutant or class of pollutants the research proposes to prevent or minimize; the seriousness, scope, level, and importance of the environmental problem; and if the proposed technology or method is more economical or more environmentally benign than current technologies or methods. The proposal should contain quantitative information on the pollutants prevented and estimate both process or plant level and national level benefits. It should also address the potential and estimated timeframe for commercial viability of the proposed approach.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">While the proposed research may be related to an individual reaction, unit operation, or unit process, the proposer should consider the environmental benefits or impacts of the research in the broader context of the system of which it is a part. In this regard, the proposal must contain a discussion of expected potential environmental benefits or impacts of the proposed research in the broadest systems sense, which may include considerations of the efficient use of natural resources and energy, and materials flows in manufacturing, product use, recycle, recovery or ultimate disposal. This requirement does not imply the need for a full life-cycle analysis, but should be as specific and quantitative as possible.</P><P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>6.

on the FastLane Website at:
<a href="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov">http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov</a></p><a name="review"></a>
<h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3><a name="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4><a name="reviewproc"></a>
<p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project.  These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process.  NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers.  Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.  Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>

      <p>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals 
        at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<a href="/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">NSB 
        97-72</a>). All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit 
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional 
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs 
        and activities. </p>

<p>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued Important Notice 127, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding decisions.</p>

<p>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>

<p>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>

<p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information).  The criteria include considerations that help define them.  These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal.  While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgements.</p>

<ul><b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br />

How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields?  How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project?  (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.)  To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?  Is there sufficient access to resources?</ul>

<ul><b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br />

How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</ul>

<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<ul><i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br />

One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</ul>

<ul><i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br />

Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</ul>

      <a name="rev_addl_crit_txt"></a><p><b>ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA</b></p>
      <ul><span class="user_input">
    <P>All proposals will be evaluated by panel review. However, if a proposal deals with a highly specialized area, supplemental mail review may be used.</P><P><STRONG>Special Criteria for Judging NTE proposals</STRONG></P><UL><LI>Research must be based on novel ideas that are NOT already widely researched and published. (Phase I ideas may be supported by only limited preliminary data.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI><LI>The proposals must contain a high level of engineering technology input.&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI><LI>A reasonable plan for the feasibility demonstration within the proposed budget and schedule must be included.</LI></UL><P><STRONG><EM>Industrially Relevant Issues and Impact</EM></STRONG></P><P>TSE has been established to address problems related to industrial pollution prevention and avoidance at the source. Therefore, each TSE proposal will be evaluated on its potential impact on industrial pollution. The proposer may find much useful (though not required) background information on the Internet. Significant process industry concerns are highlighted in documents such as Vision 2020, on the Web at <A href="http://www.ccrhq.org/vision/index.html">http://www.ccrhq.org/vision/index.html</A>. A list of toxic chemicals can be found at <A href="http://www.epa.gov/tri/chemical.html">http://www.epa.gov/tri/chemical.html</A>. A list of high production volume chemicals may be found at <A href="http://www.epa.gov/chemrtk/hpvchmlt.htm">http://www.epa.gov/chemrtk/hpvchmlt.htm</A>.</P><P>Industrial collaborators are another source of environmental issues to be addressed. If an industrial collaboration is described in the proposal, reviewers will assess the collaborative contribution to meeting the goals of this competition.</P><P>Collaboration on environmental projects with government laboratories such as NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is also encouraged, especially when the project is fundamental and yet of importance to industry. However, award funds may not be allocated to government partners.</P><P><STRONG>NSF/EPA Post-Review</STRONG></P><P>Following the review panel, a joint selection panel of NSF and EPA staff will review the recommendations of the panel and arrive at agency funding recommendations. Applications that receive high merit scores from the peer reviewers are subjected to a programmatic ("relevancy") review within EPA, the object of which is to assure a balanced research portfolio for EPA. Scientists from the Office of Research and Development (ORD) Laboratories and EPA program and regional offices review these recommended applications in relation to program priorities and their complementarity to the ORD intramural program and recommend selections to the National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) (<A href="http://www.epa.gov/ncer">http://www.epa.gov/ncer</A>).</P><P>Staff from NSF and EPA will contact the potential grantee regarding possible clarifications of the budget, scope, and format. Copies of the evaluations by technical reviewers will be made available to each applicant at the end of the decision process. In case of proposals that may be funded by EPA, some different forms will be necessary to conform to EPA format and policy requirements. Funding decisions are the sole responsibility of EPA and NSF. Grants are selected on the basis of technical merit, relevancy to the research priorities outlined, program balance, and budget. The anticipated date of awards is Summer 2003. The total funding will be about $9.5 million--approximately $6.0 million from NSF and $3.5 million from EPA, subject to the availability of funds and proposal quality.</P><P><STRONG>Proprietary Information</STRONG></P><P>By submitting an application in response to this solicitation, the applicant grants NSF and EPA permission to share the application with technical reviewers both within and outside the Agencies. Applications should not include proprietary or other types of confidential information that cannot be evaluated on this basis.</P></span></ul><br /><a name="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4> <h8><p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other
persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field
represented by the proposal.

  Proposals submitted in response to this
 announcement/solicitation
  will be reviewed by <span class="user_input">
<a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>
Panel Review.
</span></p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either
support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to
manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers
and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months.  The time interval begins on the date of receipt.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the
proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division
of Grants and Agreements (or the equivalent EPA division) for review of business, financial, and
policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or
other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and
Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on
behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment
on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary
discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or
organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF
Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p></h8><a name="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3><a name="awardnotify"></a>

<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must 
  submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before 
  the end of the current budget period.  
</p><a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>

	<div class="user_input">
	    <P>The Investigator should consult with the cognizant NSF program officer 
          because individual program officers may have additional or more specific 
          guidelines for these reports.</P>
      </div>
 <p>
  Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final 
  project report.  Failure to provide final 
  technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs.  PIs 
  should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
  required data.

<p>This section describes a few of the numerous EPA and NSF
activities related to environmental technology. The activities
described below are for background information only. They may not
necessarily be related to this solicitation, and they may not
currently be accepting proposals separate from this
solicitation.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong></p>

<p>The NSF/EPA&nbsp;Technology for a Sustainable
Environment&nbsp;activity is an integral part of EPA's STAR program
(Science To Achieve Results), and supports EPA's Green Chemistry
Challenge Program, Green Engineering, Design for the Environment,
and other pollution prevention activities in EPA.</p>

<p><em>The STAR Program (Science To Achieve Results):</em> This is
EPA's extramural research grant program, an important mechanism for
promoting a sound scientific foundation for environmental
protection. STAR is administered by the Office of Research and
Development's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER).
Specific programmatic announcements will be found on the Internet
at <a
href="http://www.epa.gov/ncer">http://www.epa.gov/ncer</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Green Chemistry Program:</em> This EPA program is
directed at preventing pollution by promoting design of less toxic
chemical substances and alternative chemical pathways that involve
less toxic feedstocks, reagents, or solvents and generate fewer
toxic products, by-products, or co-products. As part of this
program, EPA has initiated the Green Chemistry Challenge Program to
recognize and promote fundamental and innovative chemical
methodologies that accomplish pollution prevention through source
reduction and that have a broad application in industry. Green
chemistry encompasses all aspects and types of chemical
processes--including synthesis, catalysis, analysis, monitoring,
separations, and reaction conditions--that reduce negative impacts
on human health and the environment relative to the current state
of the art. Through awards and grants programs, the Green Chemistry
Challenge Program recognizes and promotes fundamental and
innovative technologies that incorporate the principles of green
chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use. The Green
Chemistry Challenge Awards Program recognizes those in industry,
academia, and government who have met the Green Chemistry
objectives in an exemplary way. The Green Chemistry Challenge
Grants Program, through projects awarded under TSE, enhances
support for cutting-edge research in this area.</p>

<p><em>National Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference:</em>
Held each year in Washington, D.C. by the American Chemical Society
with support from EPA, NSF, and several other federal agencies and
trade and professional organizations, this conference presents the
latest research findings and provides a forum for an annual
overview of research in the environmental&nbsp;area.</p>

<p><em>Design for the Environment (DFE) and the Green Engineering
Programs:</em> Through the DFE program, EPA provides businesses
with information to make environmentally-informed choices and
ultimately prevent pollution and reduce risks. DFE partners with
industry, public interest groups, universities, research
institutions, labor groups, and other governmental agencies to
evaluate cleaner alternatives to existing products, processes, or
technologies. Across a wide variety of projects, the DFE program
strives to promote the consideration of environmental factors along
with the traditional business decision parameters of cost and
performance. Currently, DFE supports cooperative industry projects
in eight sectors. Other green engineering programs include
educational partnerships for curriculum development and
professional training in pollution prevention, and a project in
environmental accounting.</p>

<p><strong>National Science Foundation</strong></p>

<p>The National Science Foundation, in its core programs and
in&nbsp;special solicitations, supports fundamental research in a
broad sweep of environmental areas, including ecosystem studies,
marine and freshwater research, atmospheric sciences, risk
analysis, polar regions, climate change, as well as environmentall
relevant engineering, materials sciences, and computation.
Programmatic descriptions are posted on the NSF web site, <a
href="http://www.geo.nsf.gov/ere">http://www.geo.nsf.gov/ere</a>.</p>

<p>A special NSF competition on <em>Biocomplexity in the
Environment</em> is usually held every one or two years. The last
round was held in Spring 2002, and solicited proposals in the
following areas: Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems;
Coupled Bio-geochemical Cycles; Genome-Enabled Environmental
Science and Engineering; Instrumentation Development for
Environmental Activities, and Materials Use: Science, Engineering
and Society. Those interested in environmental technologies may
find opportunities in each of these areas. For example, research
related to industrial ecology, life-cycle analysis, genetic
engineering, and sensor development may be appropriate in the four
areas, respectively. Research is required to be highly
interdisciplinary, involve complex systems, and include both
physical and living components, including humans. Quantitative
methods, education, and a global perspective are essential. See <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf02010">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf02010</a>
for details.</p>

<p><em>Environmental Molecular Science Institutes (EMSI) and
Collaborative Research Activities in Environmental Molecular
Science (CRAEMS):</em> This program, described in NSF 02-015, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/mps/chem/emsi98.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/mps/chem/emsi98.htm</a>,
is aimed at increasing fundamental issues that underpin the
amelioration of environmental problems caused by societal
activities that are energy- and pollution-intensive. Projects are
expected to advance the discipline of chemistry and related
molecular sciences, increase understanding of environmental
systems, serve as models for excellence in collaborative
interdisciplinary research, and contribute ultimately to beneficial
technologies and processes. The program is supported by the
Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate,
and are also supported by the Office of Sciences (SC) of the
Department of Energy.</p>

<p><strong>Joint NSF and EPA Metabolic Engineering
Activities</strong></p>

<p><em>Interagency Announcement of Opportunities in Metabolic
Engineering:</em> Metabolic Engineering proposals will not be
funded in TSE or NTE and should be directed to this program
instead. This activity is designed to allow two or more agencies to
support Metabolic Engineering projects of common interest. The most
recent program announcement is NSF 02-037. It provides an
interagency definition of Metabolic Engineering and focuses on
three topic areas that are of particular interest to the eight
participating agencies (including EPA and NSF): bio-remediation,
environmentally-conscious manufacturing, and pollution prevention.
Researchers are strongly advised to consult with contacts within
two or more participating agencies prior to submitting a proposal.
(The NSF contact is Fred Heineken.)</p>

<p><strong>Other Agencies</strong></p>

<p>Federal research-support programs in the environmental&nbsp;area
can be complementary. For example, the research supported in this
solicitation is on the more fundamental end of the research
continuum, although collaboration with industrial researchers is
strongly encouraged. Funding from other agencies such as
the&nbsp;Commerce Department (e.g., the National Institute of
Standards and Technology)&nbsp;tends to support more applied stages
of research and may require collaboration and co-funding by
industry.</p></div>

<h8><h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3></h8><h8><p>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering.  Awardees are wholly responsible for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such findings or their interpretation.
</p>

<p>
NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and educators.  The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit eligibility.</p>

<p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

      </table><h8><h3>ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</h3>

<p>The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect both environmental 
quality and human health. Achievement of this mission requires the application of sound 
science to assessment of environmental problems and to evaluation of possible solutions. 
A significant challenge is to support both "core" research that is longer term and addresses 
cross-cutting environmental problems as well as problem-driven research that addresses 
science issues relevant to meeting current Agency goals. Requests for Applications 
issued by the Science To Achieve Results (STAR) program are an important mechanism 
for promoting a sound scientific foundation for environmental protection.</p>

<p>EPA's research programs focus on reduction of risks to human health and ecosystems 
and on the reduction of uncertainty associated with risk assessment. Through its 
laboratories and through grants to academic and other not-for-profit institutions, 
EPA also fosters the development and evaluation of new risk reduction technologies 
across a spectrum, from pollution prevention through treatment, remediation and monitoring. 
In all areas, EPA is interested in research that recognizes issues relating to 
environmental justice, the concept of achieving equal protection from environmental 
and health hazards for all people without regard to race, economic status, or culture.</p>
