          <blockquote>
            <p>The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for scientists early in their careers to work within and across traditional disciplinary lines, develop partnerships, and avail themselves of unique resources, sites and facilities.  The fellowship program is intended to recognize beginning investigators of significant potential, and provide them with experience that will establish them in positions of leadership in the scientific community.  During tenure, fellows will affiliate with an appropriate research institution(s) and conduct research on topics supported by OCE.  The OCE fellowship program has two tracks: 1) Track 1 (Broadening Participation) and 2) Track 2 (International).  Fellowships are awards to individuals, not organizations, and are administered by the fellows.</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for scientists early in their careers to work within and across traditional disciplinary lines, develop partnerships, and avail themselves of unique research resources, sites and facilities.  The fellowship program is intended to recognize beginning investigators of significant potential, and provide them with experience that will establish them in positions of leadership in the scientific community.  During tenure, fellows will affiliate with an appropriate research institution(s) and conduct research on topics supported by OCE.  The OCE fellowship program has two tracks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Track 1: Broadening Participation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The National Science Foundation is charged with ensuring the vitality of the nation's scientific and technological enterprise. In its <a href="http://nsf.gov/pubs/2006/nsb05142/nsb05142.pdf">2020 Vision for the National Science Foundation Report (NSB 05-142)</a>, the National Science Board articulated a vision for the future of science and technology that includes tapping the talents of all citizens, particularly those belonging to groups that are under-represented in the science and research enterprise. In response to this report, OCE offers postdoctoral research fellowships intended to increase the number of scientists from under-represented groups pursuing research careers in the ocean sciences. In this solicitation, the term under-represented groups will refer to and include the following: veterans, persons with disabilities, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Track 2: International</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The National Science Board has repeatedly challenged NSF and the U.S. research community to engage globally.  See for example <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsb084/index.jsp?org=NSF">NSB 08-4, titled International Science and Engineering Partnerships: A Priority for U.S. Foreign Policy and Our Nation's Innovation Enterprise</a>.  In partnership with NSF's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=IIA">Office of International and Integrative Activities</a>, OCE offers postdoctoral fellowships that support research stays at host institutions outside the United States and involve true intellectual collaboration with foreign scientists.</p>
      
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>A. Appropriateness for OCE Priorities</p>
          <p>Fellowship projects must fall within the purview of OCE, which includes a diversity of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary areas. OCE programs include Biological Oceanography, Chemical Oceanography, Physical Oceanography, Marine Geology and Geophysics, Ocean Drilling, and Ocean Science and Technology. All proposals must include an ocean science research effort; proposals that are solely focused on education will not be considered. <strong>Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Program Director in their area of science (see </strong><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OCE">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OCE</a><strong>) to discuss the appropriateness of their research for funding</strong><strong>.</strong>  </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For Track 1 (Broadening Participation) proposals</strong>, applicants must include an explicit plan to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in ocean sciences in the United States. Effective broadening participation activities often leverage resources and programs at the host institution(s) or other organizations, and applicants are encouraged to discuss broadening participation activities in detail with their proposed host institution(s) prior to proposal submission. Applicants may also want to review relevant documents, such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Journal of Geoscience Education (2007), volume 66 no. 6. (Special issue on Broadening Participation);</li>
                <li>Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads (2011), Committee on Underrepresented Groups and the Expansion of the Science and Engineering Workforce Pipeline; Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy; Policy and Global Affairs; National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine. National Academies Press (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12984">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12984</a>);</li>
                <li>Report to the President "Engage to Excel: producing one million additional college graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics" (2012), Executive Office of the President, President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf</a>); and</li>
                <li>Institute for Broadening Participation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ibparticipation.org/">http://www.ibparticipation.org/</a>).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">OCE and NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities (IIA) are cooperating to support OCE-PRF fellows who wish to pursue significant international research collaborations.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Track 1 (Broadening Participation) applicants who propose a combined total of 9 months or longer at a foreign location(s) may request an international allowance of up to $10,000 per year to cover international travel and living costs. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/iprffapp.jsp">IIA guidelines</a> for details.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For Track 2 (International) proposals,</strong> researchers have the opportunity to conduct extended research abroad and establish international collaborations early in their careers. The purpose is to promote collaborative relationships between U.S. scientists and foreign host scientists that would not be possible without support from this fellowship. For Track 2 (International), applicants must propose a sponsoring scientist who is affiliated with an appropriate non-U.S. foreign host institution(s) outside the United States, projects must involve true intellectual collaboration with the foreign scientist(s), and fellows must spend their entire fellowship term at the foreign institution(s). The broader impacts of a Track 2 proposal are not required to focus on broadening participation because the Fellows will not be residing in the U.S. Track 2 (International) applicants cannot request an international research location in their country of origin. Track 2 (International) awards include a $10,000 per year international allowance in order to help cover some of the additional costs of moving and living outside of the United States. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/iprffapp.jsp">IIA guidelines</a> for details.</li>
          </ul>
    
   <p>B. Host Organization(s)</p>
       
          <p>The fellow must affiliate with a host organization(s). Appropriate organizations include U.S. and foreign colleges and universities, private nonprofit research institutes and museums, and government agencies. Multiple host organizations are permitted, and may be particularly appropriate to pursue interdisciplinary work, collaborative opportunities, and activities related to broadening participation. Regardless of the number of host organizations proposed, a primary host organization must be identified.</p>
          <p>In general, NSF expects that the fellowship will support work at an organization(s) other than the fellow's graduate institution or organization of current affiliation. Consequently, candidates proposing to be hosted by their graduate/current organization must present strong justification and must clearly explain the benefits of this choice to their research, and to their broadening participation and/or international collaboration goals. Such proposals will be evaluated in the context of the potential benefits of this choice versus benefits that might be expected from expanding professional contacts and diversifying professional experience at a new organization.</p>
          <p>C. Sponsoring Scientist(s)</p>
          <p>In addition to affiliation with a host organization(s), the candidate must identify a sponsoring scientist(s) who will provide mentoring and guidance for the research, as well as for the broadening participation and/or international collaboration goals. If more than one sponsor is proposed, one must be named lead sponsor and the roles of the other sponsors must be clearly stated in the project description.</p>
          <p>The candidate is responsible for making all arrangements with the host organization(s) and sponsoring scientist(s). An important basis for judging the proposal will be the degree to which the letter(s) from the sponsoring scientist(s) describes and offers research, broadening participation and/or international collaboration, and mentoring opportunities that could not be pursued without fellowship support.</p>
        
     
        <h3> <a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
         
          <p>Duration and Tenure:</p>
          <p>Up to 24 full-time-equivalent months of support may be requested. Fellowship tenures must begin on the first of the month between June 1 to December 1 in the year following the submission target date.</p>
          <p>Interruptions in tenure or extensions without additional cost to NSF are permitted only for extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the fellow and require NSF approval.</p>
          <p>Within the fellowship period, one month per year of fellowship duration may be used for paid leave, including parental or family leave. The paid leave cannot be used to increase the level of NSF support beyond the duration of the fellowship. NSF enables career-life balance through a variety of mechanisms. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/">https://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/</a>.</p>
          <p>Candidates selected to receive fellowships will be contacted by NSF and asked to provide additional information, such as acceptance forms and starting certificates. Successful candidates who have not completed the PhD at the time of proposal submission must provide certification of the completion of all PhD degree requirements before receiving their fellowship award. Normally fellowships will be held at organizations specified in the proposal, but under certain circumstances and with suitable justification, fellows may transfer during the tenure of the fellowship to a new organization upon approval by NSF.</p>
          <p>Fellowships are not renewable.</p>
          <p>During the period of the fellowship, no additional appointment or fellowship may be held without prior permission of the cognizant NSF program officer.</p>
          <p>If a Fellow chooses to accept employment (i.e. a tenure-track position) during the first year of the Fellowship, the fellowship stipend and allowance will be terminated upon the start of the new position. </p>
          <p>Stipend and Allowances:</p>
          <p>The annual fellowship amount of $87,000 consists of two types of payments:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>An annual stipend of $62,000, typically paid in monthly installments directly to the fellow as an electronic funds transfer into a personal account at a financial institution; and</li>
            <li>An annual fellowship allowance of $25,000, typically paid as a lump sum directly to the fellow in the same manner, and intended to cover costs such as:</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>Expenses directly related to the conduct of the proposed research, broadening participation and/or international goals, including but not limited to materials and supplies, equipment, computing resources, access to databases, domestic and international travel, publication charges, and subscription fees;</li>
            <li>Expenses in support of the fellow, such as office space, general purpose supplies and use of equipment, facilities and other institutional resources; and</li>
            <li>Expenses in support of fringe benefits, which may include but are not limited to individual or family health insurance provided through a group or individual plan, dental and/or vision insurance, disability insurance, retirement savings, dependent care, and moving expenses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Track 2 (International) awards will include a $10,000 per year international allowance in order to help cover some of the additional costs of moving and living outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>An international allowance of up to $10,000 per year may also be requested by Track 1 (Broadening Participation) applicants who propose 9 months or longer at a foreign location(s). Expenses can include travel and living costs for the fellow and his/her dependents, and must be detailed in the budget justification. See IIA guidelines for details.</p>
          <p>Both Track 1 and Track 2 fellowship budgets can be increased to include a Facilitation Award for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED). When requesting FASED funding, applicants should contact the OCE-PRF program officer prior to applying.</p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to the above criteria, the following factors will be used in the evaluation process: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Qualifications of the candidate and his/her potential for continued professional growth and leadership in the field; </li>
          <li>Suitability of the sponsoring scientist(s) and host organization(s); </li>
          <li>For Track 1 (Broadening Participation): The potential to enhance the broader participation of under-represented groups in ocean sciences in the United States;</li>
          <li>For Track 2 (International): The extent to which the project involves true intellectual collaboration with foreign scientists and would leverage expertise and specialized skills, facilities, and/or resources of the foreign research site.</li>
        </ul>

 
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
   <p>     <strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
        <p>The fellowship award is made to the individual, not the institution and payments are made directly to the fellow.  Awards cannot be extended without prior NSF approval.  Pre-award costs are not permitted. </p>
        <p>Candidates selected to receive fellowships will be contacted by NSF and asked to provide additional information, such as acceptance forms and starting certificates. Successful candidates who have not completed the PhD at the time of proposal submission must provide certification of the completion of all PhD degree requirements before receiving any fellowship funds. </p>
        <p>Normally fellowships will be held at organizations specified in the proposal, but under certain circumstances and with suitable justification, fellows may transfer during the tenure of the fellowship to a new organization upon approval by NSF.</p>
        <p>During the period of the fellowship, no additional appointment or fellowship may be held without prior permission of the cognizant NSF program officer.  If an individual accepts a tenure-track (or equivalent) position between time of proposal submission and selection for a fellowship, they will typically be expected to withdraw the OCE-PRF proposal.   OCE-PRF fellows who accept tenure-track (or equivalent) appointments after receiving the fellowship may be required to return unused funding to NSF.</p>
        <p>Candidates are encouraged to discuss institutional policies on intellectual property rights with the sponsoring scientist(s) before submitting the proposal. Candidates should also discuss the policies of the sponsoring scientist(s) regarding which materials will remain with the host organization(s) and which can be released to the fellow at the conclusion of the fellowship.</p>
        <p>Fellows are required to adhere to OCE data guidelines available on the NSF website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11060">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11060</a>. Final reports should include a statement describing how requirements have been met.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Reporting Requirements:</strong> Fellows must file starting and termination certificates in addition to annual and final technical reports.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
