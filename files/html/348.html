          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
            <p>The Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), have joined to support the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science program. This program supports active long-term collaborative partnerships between K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, Computer and Information Science, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers and community college and university faculty and students to bring knowledge of engineering or computer and information science and engineering as well as technological innovation to pre-college/community college classrooms. The goal of these partnerships is to enable K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty to translate their research experiences and new knowledge gained in university settings into their classroom activities. The university team will include faculty, graduate and undergraduate students as well as industrial advisors. Involvement of graduate students in support of academic-year classroom activities is particularly encouraged.  Partnerships with inner city, rural or other high needs schools are especially encouraged, as is participation by underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p>As part of the long-term partnership arrangements, university undergraduate/graduate students will partner with pre-college/community college faculty in their classrooms during the academic year to help teach engineering/computer science concepts.</p>
            <p>This announcement features two mechanisms for support of in-service and pre-service K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty: (1) RET supplements to ongoing ENG and CISE awards and (2) new RET Site awards. RET supplements may be included outside this solicitation in proposals for new or renewed NSF Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) grants or as supplements to ongoing NSF ENG and CISE funded projects. RET in Engineering and Computer Science Sites, through this solicitation, are based on independent proposals from engineering or computer and/or information science departments, schools or colleges to initiate and conduct research participation projects for K-12 STEM teachers and/or community college faculty.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Encouraging active participation of K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty in NSF supported projects is an excellent way to reach broadly into the teacher talent pool of the U.S. such that (1) they can enrich their teaching of engineering and computer science concepts to their students; (2) they can encourage, stimulate, and guide their students more effectively to seek engineering and computer science careers; and (3) they can share and disseminate what they have learned with other teachers in their field.  The Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science program offers a framework by which these educators may engage in meaningful university research experiences in partnership with faculty, students, and industry mentors, and then adapt this new knowledge into their teaching practices. Support for these educators to engage in engineering and computer science research projects is through Site awards and Supplements to on-going research and education projects funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). Through these partnerships, the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Program aims to:</p>
          <ul>
         <li> Build long-term collaborative relationships between both in-service and pre-service K-12 science, technology, engineering, computer science, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, community college faculty, and the engineering and computer science research community;</li>
          <li> Support the active participation of these teachers and future teachers and community college faculty in research and education projects funded by NSF ENG and CISE;</li>
          <li> Facilitate professional development of K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty through strengthened partnerships between institutions of higher education and local school districts;</li>
       <li>Engage industry in an advisory role to 1) strengthen the preparation of students for the future workforce needs of industry and 2) form meaningful partnerships with the K-12 and community college sectors and learn first-hand the ongoing challenges they face;</li>
   <li>Provide instructional opportunities to graduate students who mentor teachers in the RET program and involve graduate students in K-12 classroom support activities during the academic year; and</li>
         <li> Provide leadership opportunities to teachers and community college faculty who participate in the program by requiring that they disseminate information about their research experience to a broader audience. </li></ul>

        <h3> 
         II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
    
          <p>The Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science program encourages the active participation of both in-service and pre-service (education majors who are still pursuing their degrees) K-12 science, technology, engineering, computer science and mathematics (STEM) teachers and community college faculty in ongoing NSF-supported engineering and computer science research activities through Site awards and Supplements. Encouraging active participation of teachers and community college faculty in NSF projects is an excellent way to reach broadly into the teacher talent pool of the U.S. so that they can teach engineering and computer science concepts to their students to encourage and stimulate them to pursue engineering and computer science careers.</p>
          <p>ENG and CISE strongly encourage all of their grantees, including grantees from the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, to make special efforts to identify talented teachers and community college faculty for participation in this RET opportunity.</p>
          <p><strong>RET in Engineering and Computer Science Supplement.</strong> A request for funding of a RET in Engineering and Computer Science Supplement should be made under an existing NSF ENG or CISE award or within a proposal for a new or renewed NSF ENG or CISE award. The description of the RET activity must clearly articulate in some detail the form and nature of the prospective K-12 STEM teacher and/or community college faculty member's involvement in the Principal Investigator's ongoing or proposed research. See Section V.A. (5), "Project Description," below for detailed information. For example, the teacher or community college faculty member may participate in the design of new experiments, modeling and analysis of experimental data, algorithm and software development, and other activities that will result in intellectual contributions to the project. It is expected that the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Supplement experience will also lead to the transfer of new knowledge to classroom activities. Therefore, the RET Supplement description must also indicate what type of sustained follow-up will be provided during the academic year to help in translating the teacher's research experience and new understanding of engineering and computer science concepts into classroom practice.</p>
          <p><strong>RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site Project.</strong> A RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site project is an independent proposal, submitted under this solicitation at an annual deadline date, to provide groups of in-service and pre-service K-12 STEM teachers and/or community college faculty with discovery and technology-based research experiences in engineering and/or computer science laboratories and facilities, which will then be incorporated into their classroom activities during the school year. A RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site project may be conducted during the summer, academic year, or both, and each must have a well-defined research focus, with clearly articulated projects and activities for 10 or more teachers and/or community college faculty per year.</p>
          <p>A RET Site proposal must be submitted by a College, School, or Department of Engineering, Engineering Technology, or Computer and/or Information Science and must involve at least 10 or more teachers and/or community college faculty in an engineering or computer and/or information science research project for a duration of at least six weeks during the summer. In those cases where limited availability of specialized facilities, such as clean rooms, electron microscopes, etc., make it possible to offer an extraordinary experience in a shorter timeframe, a research component of a shorter duration may be proposed with appropriate justification. An orientation session must be included at the beginning of the program for the teachers and/or community college faculty to acquaint them with laboratory methods, safety procedures, analytical methods, etc., as appropriate to the proposal. Because the RET experience also will lead to the transfer of new knowledge to classroom activities, the proposal must provide a plan for sustained follow-up by the RET Site project team with the teachers and/or community college faculty to ensure that the research experience is translated into classroom practice during the academic year. Projects should include faculty and/or graduate student support for academic-year K-12 classroom activities.  Projects should include academic-year activities for the teachers to facilitate dissemination of their classroom modules to a broader audience and to provide opportunities for other teachers to incorporate the curricular materials and learning activities that the RET teachers develop during their RET participation. The Site proposal must include a request for support of a conference or other outreach activities designed to reach other local teachers and/or community college faculty not involved in a RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site project so as to inform them of the outcomes and materials developed as a result of the Site project. The proposal must provide a detailed plan for evaluation of the proposed project and the classroom impact. Finally, the proposal must clearly identify an external evaluator and demonstrate the qualifications of the evaluator to develop and conduct a credible evaluation based on project and programmatic goals and outcomes.</p>
          <p><strong>Other Opportunities.  </strong>ENG and CISE strongly encourage the use of RET supplements to enable K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty to participate in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund</a> for a list of currrent, active REU Sites.</p>
          <p>The RET in Engineering and Computer Science program will allow PIs to involve participating teachers and community college faculty in international research experiences in their proposals. PIs may contact NSF's International Science and Engineering Section staff, with expertise in the country or region of interest, for information about institutions and counterpart agencies.

        <p><strong>Proposals for RET in Engineering and Computer Science Sites must include the following:</strong></p>
        <ol>
      <li><strong>Cover Sheet.</strong> Select the number for the RET in Engineering and Computer Science program solicitation from the pull-down list. (Grants.gov users: The program solicitation number will be pre-populated by Grants.gov on the NSF Grant Application Cover Page.) The NSF organizational unit to which proposals should be directed is EEC - Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science. In the title of the project, start with the label "RET Site."</li><br />
     <li> <strong>Information about Principal Investigators. </strong>A single individual should be designated clearly as principal investigator. This individual will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the RET Site award. However, the institution may designate one additional person as co-principal investigator, should developing and operating the RET Site involve such shared responsibility. Other anticipated research supervisors or mentors are listed as senior personnel. The principal investigator of a RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site proposal must have a full-time tenure or tenure-track faculty appointment, within a College/Department of Engineering or Engineering Technology or a College/Department of Computer and/or Information Science broadly defined (e.g., including HCI, Software Engineering, Networking Science, Informatics) of the submitting U.S. academic institution.</li><br />
   <li> <strong>Project Summary</strong> (one-page limit). The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.</li>
        <p>Provide a description of the activities that would result if the project is funded, including comments on its objectives, teachers and/or community college faculty to be accepted, intended impact on participating teachers and/or community college faculty and their students, and academic-year follow-up and outreach activities. The project summary should include the following information: name of the host institution/organization, school districts and other institutions involved; the major field and subfields that describe the proposal area; a project title that will permit a prospective participant to identify the research focus of the Site (the title will be used in web-based lists of RET in Engineering and Computer Science Sites); the number of teachers and/or community college faculty involved; the number of summer weeks on site and months of academic year activity; the name, telephone number, and email address of the point-of-contact for teacher and/or community college faculty recruitment; and a web address for Site information (if known).</p>
        <li><strong>Table of Contents. </strong>The Table of Contents is system-generated and cannot be edited.</li><br />
        <li> <strong>Project Description.</strong> The project description contains the following items "a" through "h" and is not to exceed 15 pages in length. <strong><em>Please note that per guidance in the GPG, the Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled "Broader Impacts". This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. You can decide where to include this section within the Project Description.</em></strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
        <li>Overview. Provide a brief description of the goals and objectives of the proposed RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site, targeted teacher and/or community college faculty participants, intellectual research focus, broader impact of the proposed activity, organizational structure, timetable, and institutional commitment to the RET activity.</li><br />
        <li>Nature of Teacher and/or Community College Faculty Activities. A RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site program may be conducted during the summer, academic year, or both, and must have a well-defined research focus, with clearly articulated research projects and activities for teachers and/or community college faculty. The teachers and/or community college faculty must be involved in an engineering or computer science research project for a duration of at least six weeks. In those cases where limited availability of specialized facilities, such as clean rooms, electron microscopes, etc., makes it possible to offer an extraordinary experience in a shorter timeframe, a research component of a shorter duration may be proposed with appropriate justification. An orientation session must be included at the beginning of the program for the teachers and/or community college faculty to acquaint them with laboratory methods, safety procedures, analytical methods, etc. as appropriate to the proposal. Proposals must address the approach to research training being undertaken and must provide detailed descriptions of examples of research projects that the teachers and/or community college faculty will pursue. These research projects must be relevant to the subjects taught by the participating teachers and/or community college faculty during the academic year. Proposals must present plans that will ensure the development of RET in Engineering and Computer Science participant-faculty interaction and communication. Including industry-related projects and mentors is encouraged.  Because development of collegial and industry relationships and interactions is an important part of the project opportunity, the teachers and/or community college faculty should work closely in teams with university faculty and students.</li><br />
        <li>The Research Environment. This subsection should describe the experience and record of involvement with K-12/community college education and research of the principal investigator, the faculty, graduate students and master teachers, who may serve as research mentors, the institution, and industry. This should include information on the record of faculty/mentors in publishing research results and providing professional development opportunities for K-12 STEM teachers and/or community college faculty.  It should describe activities to train/prepare mentors, particularly graduate students, to support the teachers during their summer and academic year activities. </li><br />
        <li>Participant Recruitment and Selection. The overall quality of the participant recruitment and selection processes and criteria will be an important element in proposal evaluation. The recruitment plan should be described with as much specificity as possible, including the types and/or names of institutions from which participants will be recruited and the efforts to be made to attract members of underrepresented groups (women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities). It is encouraged, but not required, that at least two STEM teachers and/or community college faculty be recruited for the program from the same K-12 school/community college in order to help ensure that outcomes of the program are more effectively disseminated to the participating institutions.</li>
        <p>RET Site participants must be currently teaching a STEM subject at their institution in order to participate in this program. It is also strongly encouraged that participants be allowed to participate in the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site program for two consecutive years.</p>
        <li> Follow-up Plan. A major goal of the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site program is to help encourage and develop long-term relationships between the teacher and/or community college faculty participants, the RET Site project faculty team, the participating school districts, particularly during the academic year, and industry. The RET experience also will lead to the transfer of new knowledge to classroom activities; therefore, the proposal must provide a plan for sustained academic-year follow-up by the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site project team with the teachers and/or community college faculty to ensure that the research experience is translated into classroom practice during the academic year. In particular, it is encouraged to have graduate students support academic-year classroom activities related to the summer research.  A plan involving ongoing interaction that supports classroom implementation of lesson plans, curricula, or skills developed in the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site project must be included in the proposal. Plans must be included for academic-year conferences or other outreach activities such that the RET teachers can disseminate their curricular materials and modules as well as details of their RET participation to a broader audience of teachers in their own communities.</li>
        <p>If a request is being made for renewal support of a previously funded RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site, documentation must be provided on follow-up and dissemination activities conducted during the prior RET Site program.</p>
        <li>Project Evaluation and Reporting. This subsection should provide a detailed plan for formative and summative evaluation of the proposed project. The objective of the evaluation process is to measure qualitatively and quantitatively the progress and impacts of the project in achieving its goals, particularly the degree to which the participants have learned and their perspectives on science, engineering, or computer science have been expanded, as well as the impact on K-12 and community college students and their curricula. The evaluation plan is an important part of the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site proposal, but proposers have much latitude in designing a plan that best suits their particular project. Although not required, RET Site project directors may wish to engage educational research specialists from their or another institution in planning and implementing the project evaluation. Formative evaluation will involve periodic measures throughout the project to ensure that it is progressing satisfactorily according to the project plan, and it will involve pre-project and post-project measures aimed at determining the degree of teacher and student learning that has been achieved as a result of the project. Additionally, it is highly desirable to have a structured means of tracking participants with the aim of gauging the degree to which the RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site experience has been a lasting influence as they follow their career paths.</li><br />
        <li>Results from Prior Support (if applicable/essential for a RET Site renewal proposal). If no prior support has been received by the submitting institution through an RET Site award, then &ldquo;N/A&rdquo; should be entered in this subsection and the maximum of 15 pages may be employed for items "a" through "f" above. If the submitting institution has received a prior RET Site award in the disciplinary area(s) of the proposal, the proposal must include a section (limited in length to five pages) entitled Results from Prior NSF Support within the 15-page narrative description of the project. This section must describe the earlier RET project(s) and outcomes(s) in sufficient detail to permit reviewers to reach an informed conclusion regarding the value of the results achieved. This will likely include results from the project evaluation, summary information on recruiting efforts and number of applicants, demographic composition of participants and their home institutions, follow-up and dissemination activities, lessons learned, modifications and changes to the proposed Site, and a list of publications or reports (if to be submitted for publication) resulting from the original NSF award.</li><br />
        <li>Dissemination. To fulfill NSF dissemination requirements, as well as to ensure long-term, free teacher access to the K-12 engineering and computer science curricular materials that are created, RET Site awardees are strongly encouraged to publish the lessons or hands-on activities developed through the awards in the <em>TeachEngineering</em> digital library (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://teachengineering.org/">http://teachengineering.org/</a>) or other repositories that reach a national audience. Other means of dissemination of K-12 engineering and computer science curricula may include posting lessons to the individual RET web site or portal and ensuring free access to educators.  All dissemination methods should be described in this subsection.</li></ol><br />
       <li><strong>References Cited.</strong> A listing of references to pertinent literature is required.</li><br />
        <li><strong>Current and Pending Support.</strong> This form should be provided for all persons listed as senior personnel (up to a total of 12 people).</li><br />
        <li><strong>Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources. </strong>Previous editions of the RET solicitation instructed applicants to omit this section and include the relevant information in the Project Description. With this revision, this section is required and must be completed in accordance with the instructions in the GPG.</li><br />
        <li><strong>Biographical Sketches.</strong> The basic guidelines for biographical material apply; however, senior personnel are encouraged to include activities or accomplishments relevant to a successful RET Site. Senior personnel are the principal investigator; the co-principal investigator if one has been designated; and other faculty/professionals who are anticipated to serve as research mentors. The number of biographical sketches is limited to 12.</li><br />
        <li><strong>Project Budget.</strong>  The focus of RET Sites is the teacher/community college faculty participant experience, and the budget must reflect this principle.   The proposal should include a detailed project budget and budget justification, as described in the GPG or the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide. The budget justification should explain and justify major cost items and any unusual situations/inclusions and address the cost-effectiveness of the project. Project costs may include such items as teacher/community college faculty stipends, housing, meals, travel, tuition, or laboratory use. A Site may not charge the participant an application fee. These costs must be listed as Participant Support costs (lines F1-F4 in FastLane and Field E in Grants.gov) in the NSF proposal budget.</li>
        <p>The total amount which may be requested for a RET Site may not exceed $600,000, with a program duration of up to three years, including no more than $200,000 per year. The program may be carried out during summer months, the academic year, or both. RET Sites must include funds for 10 or more teachers totaling at least $100,000 per year of the budget. The total cost per teacher is limited to $10,000 per year, which includes funds for the teacher/community college faculty stipend and up to $2,000 for the cost of materials, equipment, software, and other supplies for developing classroom instructions and experiments. The remaining funds, which when combined with teacher support may not exceed a total budget of up to $200,000 per year, may be requested for activities in other cost categories (e.g., salaries, wages and fringe benefits, travel, materials and supplies, and applicable indirect costs) that contribute to the effectiveness of the RET program; any such costs must be listed under the appropriate NSF budget categories and must be explained in the Budget Justification. It is expected that teacher and community college faculty stipends will be adjusted according to their length of residency at the university site and that stipends for in-service teachers will generally be higher than those for pre-service teachers (education majors who are still pursuing their degrees). The budget should also include a request for funds to cover the cost of attendance of the Principal Investigator at each year's annual awardee meeting in the Washington, DC area.</p>
        <p>Funds requested to conduct conferences should be included in the yearly proposal budget and fully itemized and described in the budget justification.</p>
        <li><strong>Supplementary Documentation.</strong> In addition to those listed in the GPG, the following documents must be provided.</li>
        <p><strong>Letters of Collaboration.</strong> Signed letters of collaboration documenting collaborative arrangements of significance to the proposal must be scanned and placed in this section. <strong>Letters of support and collaboration from participating school districts are required. If these letters are not included, the proposal will be returned without review.</strong> Letters may be relevant where the awardee and performing organizations are different, where faculty or facilities of more than one institution are to be employed, or where international activities are arranged. <strong>Letters of endorsement are not permitted.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Requests for RET Supplements must include the following:</strong></p>
        <p>RET Supplements are supported by the various disciplinary research programs within the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). A RET Supplement request may be included in a proposal for a new or renewal ENG or CISE grant or cooperative agreement, or a request may be submitted later as a supplement to an ongoing award. Guidance for use of either mechanism is given below. In either case, the description of the RET activity should clearly articulate in some detail the form and nature of the prospective teacher and/or community college faculty's involvement in the principal investigator's ongoing or proposed research. For example, the teacher and/or community college faculty member may participate in the design of new experiments, modeling and analysis of experimental data, algorithm and software development, and other activities that will result in intellectual contributions to the project.  The RET Supplement description is to indicate what type of sustained follow-up could be provided to help in translating the teacher/community college faculty research experience into classroom practice. The request should also discuss the experience of the principal investigator (or other possible research mentors) in involving K-12 teachers and/or community college faculty in research, including any previous RET Supplement support; the outcomes from that support; and the process and criteria for selection of the teachers and/or community college faculty. A brief biographical sketch of the teacher and/or community college faculty should also be included, if available.</p>
        <p>The duration of the RET Supplement will be one year and the project may be carried out during summer months, the academic year, or both. The total cost of the supplement is limited to $10,000 per teacher. The budget includes a teacher's stipend and up to $2,000 for the cost of materials, equipment, software and other supplies for developing classroom instructions and experiments. The participant may not be charged an application fee. These costs must be listed as Participant Support costs (lines F1-F4 in FastLane and Field E in Grants.gov) in the NSF proposal budget.</p>
        <p>Normally, funds may be available for one to two teachers, but exceptions will be considered. Participation of teachers and/or community college faculty who are members of underrepresented groups (women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities) is strongly encouraged. Center or large research efforts may request support for a number of teachers commensurate with the size and nature of the project. For guidance concerning RET Supplement requests, please consult with the cognizant ENG or CISE program director of the particular research program of the proposal or award.</p>
        <p>An award decision will be based on internal review by the cognizant ENG or CISE program director and availability of funds in a particular program.</p>
        <p><strong>A request for a RET Supplement</strong> <strong>to an existing award</strong> must be submitted via the NSF FastLane System. After login to FastLane, choose Award and Reporting Functions, then Supplemental Funding Request. Next choose the award to be supplemented. In the form entitled Summary of Proposed Work, state that this is a request for an RET Supplement. In the form entitled Justification for Supplement, include the information requested above, limited to three pages. If a RET participant has been pre-selected, then a brief biographical sketch should be placed in supplementary documentation. Prepare a budget, including justification of the funds requested for teacher and/or community college faculty support and their proposed use. All teacher and/or community college faculty costs must be listed as Participant Support costs (lines F1-F4 in FastLane and Field E in Grants.gov) in the NSF proposal budget.  The term of a RET Supplement may not exceed that of the underlying research project. The request is then forwarded to the institution's Authorized Organizational Representative for submission to NSF.</p>
        <p><strong>A request for a RET Supplement submitted as part of a proposal for a new or renewal grant or cooperative agreement</strong> is embedded in the proposal as follows. The description of the RET activity, as specified above and limited to three pages, is entered in FastLane or Grants.gov in the section for supplementary documentation. The budget for the RET Supplement is included in the yearly project budget. All teacher and/or community college faculty costs must be listed as Participant Support costs (lines F1-F4 in FastLane and Field E in Grants.gov) in the NSF proposal budget. The budget justification for the proposal must contain a separate explanation of the RET Supplement request, with the proposed teacher and/or community college faculty costs itemized and justified, and a total given for all proposed costs.</p></ol>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
    
   <ul>
       <li> Must have a well-defined research focus, with clearly articulated research projects and activities. Research projects must have significant engineering or computer science relevance. </li>
      <li> Should engage industry in the program to assure the work is relevant to future workforce needs in engineering and computer science.</li>
     <li> Must provide in-service and/or pre-service K-12 STEM teachers and/or community college faculty with discovery and technology based research experiences in high quality engineering or computer science labs/research facilities, which can be incorporated into classroom activities.</li>
        <li> Must recruit K-12 teachers and community college faculty, who currently teach STEM subjects at their institution, for participation in the RET activities.  It is recommended but not required that at least two teachers and/or community college faculty be recruited for the program from the same K-12 school/community college.</li>
     <li> Must involve participants in an ongoing engineering or computer science research project for a duration of at least six weeks during the summer. Shorter duration may be proposed with justification.</li>
        <li> Must include a sustained academic-year follow-up plan between the faculty and the participants to ensure that the research experience is translated to classroom practice and the program provides maximum benefit to all participants. Including graduate student support of academic-year classroom implementation activities is strongly encouraged. Plans must be included for outreach and dissemination activities to local educators. The quality and appropriateness of the academic-year plans will be explicitly assessed.</li>
     <li> Must include a detailed plan for summative and formative evaluation of the research project and (academic year) classroom impact.</li>
        <li> Must include a plan for effective dissemination of the impact on RET participants, on the quality of the classroom experience, and on the engagement and preparation of students.</li></ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p> Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.

<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
