<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>NSF hereby solicits proposals to manage and operate each of the two Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) observatories located at Poker Flat, AK, and at Resolute Bay, Canada. The two AMISR facilities will serve national goals in Geospace science research and education. These facilities are designated as Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar - North Face (RISR-N), respectively.</p>

<p>Awardees would work closely with NSF and the Geospace scientific community to ensure that each AMISR facility supports, sustains, and advances frontier Geospace science. In cooperation with NSF and within available resources, the Awardees would plan and execute a viable, coherent, and inclusive AMISR observing program to support research and education, consistent with guidance and oversight by the Geospace scientific community.</p>

<p>Proposals should describe how the proposing institution(s) would: (1) provide observing capabilities and scientific data distribution centering upon the use of the one or the other AMISR facility; (2) support the needs of NSF-funded, peer-reviewed research and education projects; (3) foster an integrated program of education, workforce development, and outreach; (4) develop, manage, and maintain the AMISR facility capabilities; and (5) establish appropriate partnerships with the community, both national and international, to support AMISR research goals.</p>

<p>NSF anticipates that successful proposals for management and operations (M&amp;O) of each AMISR facility would be awarded as a separate cooperative agreement (CA). As necessary, the Awardees will define and execute a budgeted, scheduled, and tracked project plan to manage any transition from the current to the proposed model of AMISR M&amp;O for each AMISR facility. Each cooperative agreement would have a duration of five years contingent on the availability of funds and the successful outcome of comprehensive external reviews of Awardees performance and facility success. Such an award would be renewable for an additional five years after peer review.</p>

<h3><a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<div>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National Science Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF supports facilities that provide research capabilities in various scientific disciplines. Each Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) facility will provide services and infrastructure to support research and education in the Geospace sciences.</p>

<p>This solicitation is solely for the <strong>management and operation </strong>(M&amp;O) of the AMISR facilities at Poker Flat, AK, and at Resolute Bay, Canada, for user and in-house research activities. It is anticipated that the competition would result in two separate awards, one for each AMISR site. Proposing organizations are encouraged to present creative but realistic plans to deal with the long-term budget constraints imposed on the Geospace Facilities program.</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<div>
<p><strong>A. Background</strong></p>

<p>Since the early 1970s, AGS has supported four incoherent scatter radar (ISR) facilities at Jicamarca, Arecibo, Millstone Hill, and Sondrestrom to provide range-resolved measurements of ionospheric parameters (electron density, ion and electron temperatures, the bulk plasma velocity, and the ion-neutral collision frequency) for the purpose of basic research. These ISR observatories were constructed for Department of Defense clients for defense-related missions, and then, using NSF funding they were re-purposed to support peer-reviewed Geospace research studies.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter (PFISR) and Resolute Incoherent Scatter Radar-North (RISR-N) AMISR facilities were the first ISR systems funded by NSF specifically designed and constructed for the Geospace scientific community. While the older ISR facilities are characterized by massive antenna structures and powerful, centralized transmitters, each AMISR facility uses a phase array modular design with a large number of identical electronic subsystems. Consequently, AMISR facilities have the characteristics of almost instantaneous pulse-to-pulse beam steering, remote accessibility for observing operations, and the ability to tolerate hardware failures of individual antenna element units (AEU).</p>

<p>Completion of the AMISR construction and first light for PFISR and RISR-N by SRI International took place in 2006 and 2009, respectively. A major PFISR upgrade replacing failed components was carried out in 2015-2016.  Science and engineering/technician staffing by SRI International, the current awardee, for the two AMISR facilities combined is approximately 3.5 full-time equivalents. In 2015, approximately 12% of the AMISR award went toward the support of science research activities, 30% toward the M&amp;O for RISR-N, 23% toward the M&amp;O expenses for PFISR, and 27% toward general M&amp;O expenses. It is NSF policy that large facility awards will be re-competed after the second 5 year award period is completed, which for the AMISR award will be on February 28, 2017.  This award will be extended to July 15, 2018. Consequently, this solicitation invites proposals for the M&amp;O of each AMISR facility with the award period to start after July 15, 2018, after a possible transition period.</p>

<p><strong>B. AMISR Facility Baseline Scope</strong></p>

<p>NSF will accept proposals to provide ongoing operations and maintenance support for each of the two AMISR facilities, provided those proposals meet all requirements described in this solicitation. Each AMISR facility will provide the geophysical capabilities to advance the scientific goals of the AGS-supported research and education community, as articulated in multiple guiding documents, including the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://cedarweb.vsp.ucar.edu/wiki/images/3/3b/NSF_UAF_Review_Final.pdf">Avery report (2004)</a>, the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.landau.geo.cornell.edu/papers/UAFreport.pdf"> ISR report (2008)</a>, the <a title="NAS Geospace Decadal Report 2012" href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_056864">NAS 2012 Decadal Survey</a>, and the <a title="NSF Geospace Portfolio Review 2016" href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/adgeo/geospace-review/geospace-portfolio-review-final-rpt-2016.pdf">AGS 2016 Portfolio Review Panel Report</a>. Note that estimated annual budget amounts given below should be viewed as guidelines subject to revision and the availability of funding, and that budgetary and other resource requests in any given proposal must be commensurate with the scope of work therein proposed.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Operation</strong> and Maintenance of geophysical instrumentation primarily for use by NSF-funded investigators for targeted research projects with AMISR observations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The AMISR facilities (PFISR and RISR-N) will provide fundamental long-term observations of range-resolved ionospheric parameters (electron density, ion and electron temperatures, bulk plasma convection motion, and ion-neutral collision frequency). Data from each AMISR observatory will be made freely available to any user without artificial delay or restriction.</li>
  
  <li>Each AMISR facility will support user-defined experiments in regard to possible AMISR observing plan proposed by an user.</li>
  
  <li>Each of the two AMISR observatories will provide logistics, field, data ingestion support, and user training to enable investigator-driven research in the harsh polar environment of Alaska and Resolute Bay. The AMISR instrument support should include significant capabilities to aid optical and radio science research in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A major achievement of the AMISR radar design objectives underlying its modular construction was a relocation capability that might extend the AMISR facility lifecycle.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>NSF notes that any AMISR M&amp;O proposal that includes re-deployment of PFISR to a new site of strong geophysical interest if well justified would be considered. Any expenses of the new location site preparation, relocation, and re-assembly of the AMISR frame structure necessary to house the AMISR panels would be included as part of the AMISR operations and management proposal budgets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data management systems for collection, quality assurance, curation, management, and distribution of a large volume of diverse geophysical data products</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>AMISR data management activities should include incorporation of geophysical data and metadata to the Madrigal database or its equivalent from the AMISR facility, PI-driven experiments using the AMISR facility, and other instrumental sources with agreement from NSF.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Education, workforce development, and public outreach programs</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>In addition to contributing to Geospace scientific studies, AMISR will provide excellent opportunities for distance learning and training for the next generation of radar experts. Each AMISR award is to support the operations and scientific leadership associated with each AMISR project, and will ensure that the AMISR radar and the data are effectively used by a broad segment of the national and international scientific community.</li>
  
  <li>AMISR programs should foster integration between researchers, educators, and other experts to ensure those programs are carried out in accordance with applicable national and community standards and foster greatly expanded participation of underrepresented groups. Examples of such programs may include, but are not limited to, workshops and short courses; and development of educational materials; software tools, and other distribution methods.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Awardee management of AMISR observatory providing for Geospace user support and AMISR data distribution</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>NSF believes that multiple viable AMISR management structures may exist. However, any viable structure will require professional management by highly dedicated and expert staff, carried out in direct collaboration with the AMISR Geospace community.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C. Description of Awardee Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p><em>Responsibilities</em></p>

<p>The Awardee shall be responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of the AMISR facility in accordance with the proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and Annual Program Operating Plans approved by NSF prior to each year of work. The Awardee shall ensure that AMISR capabilities enable world-class research, education, and related activities in the Geospace sciences by operating and maintaining the AMISR facility, developing and incorporating new capabilities, planning for future new initiatives, supporting a skilled and diverse work force, sustaining innovative and vigorous research and education projects awarded by NSF through the merit review process, and enabling use of AMISR for other critical stakeholder activities.</p>

<p><em>Expectations of the Awardee</em></p>

<p>The Awardee shall promote a culture of excellence that meets the highest standards for service and delivery to the scientific community and shall demonstrate a proactive and effective approach to facility management. The Awardee shall carry out all user support and research activities with direct oversight and governance from the Geospace scientific community served by AMISR operations. The Awardee shall be expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define and implement an organizational structure for the AMISR facility that provide leadership and service to manage each AMISR facility as a vibrant, user-focused facility.</li>
  
  <li>Operate the AMISR observatory whether PFISR or RISR-N at full power in the support of high-quality research programs. For example, in 2015, the full power mode resulted in 2600 hours for PFISR and 1600 hours for RISR-N.</li>
  
  <li>When not running in the full power mode, as feasible, operate the PFISR observatory in a low power mode to obtain continual measurements of basic ionospheric parameters.</li>

  <li>Disseminate and publish in a timely manner scientific and technical results and conclusions developed in the course of the project.</li>
  
  <li>Schedule, coordinate, and plan experiments making use of the PFISR or RISR-N radar system. The awardee should implement a review process for evaluating time allocation of the AMISR radars, including steps to announce availability of time to outside scientists, criteria for allocating time, procedures for review of requests, and describe a process for resolving disputes.</li>

  <li>Develop and share with the scientific community software for AMISR operating modes, data acquisition, and data analysis that will aid outside users in planning and conducting experiments, as well as in using the AMISR data for scientific research.</li>
  
  <li>Assist users in the acquisition and analysis of data obtained with each AMISR radar. Contribute reduced data acquired during the coordinated community experiments - such as those pertaining to the "World Day" experiments or the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) initiative- to the Madrigal data base or its equivalent. The data are to be reduced to physical parameters - electron density, electron and ion temperatures, and line-of-sight velocities- and where appropriate to electric fields (or vector velocities or electrostatic potential). These data products are normally to be sent to the database within two months of data acquisition.</li>

  <li>Convene and organize workshops to facilitate AMISR science planning, demonstrate radar capabilities, and educate scientists and students on radar usage and data analysis and interpretation.</li>

  <li>Establish and maintain an effective, broadly representative, community-based governance and oversight structure to guide each AMISR radar activities. Structure proposed must be based fundamentally on ongoing direct involvement of the scientific community in all aspects of AMISR research.</li>

  <li>Assist visiting scientists in logistical arrangements, such as transportation, housing, and shipping of auxiliary site instruments.</li>

  <li>Draft and maintain a facility user manual.</li>

  <li>If the proposal makes reference to a possible relocation of PFISR to an alternate site of strong geophysical interest, then the proposal should include specific details regarding the expected relocation timeline, site preparation, AMISR structure engineering requirements, and estimated expenses.</li>

  <li>In the event of multiple Awardees being selected, all Awardees will be expected to coordinate with each other, the scientific community, and NSF to ensure that all AMISR activities are carried out efficiently, effectively, and responsively.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Important Considerations in the Preparation of a Proposal</em></p>

<p>Proposed management and business structures should be described fully in the proposal, including descriptions of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The proposed organizational structure, with well-defined lines of authority and responsibility within the organization;</li>

  <li>Business systems capacities, including accounting systems with procedures for auditing and oversight; the ability to segregate and account separately for funding from NSF and that from other sources; procurement staff and processes; a property management system capable of acquiring, tracking and controlling equipment funded by NSF and, separately, equipment funded by other sources; and</li>
  
  <li>Processes for planning future operations and initiatives carried out in full collaboration with the  stakeholder communities.</li>
</ol>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>

<p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>

<p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>

<p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>

<p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<a name="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>

<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>

<p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>

<p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
<li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
<li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>

<p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>

<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.</p>

<p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
<ol type="a">
<li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
<li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
<li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
<li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
<li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
</ol>

<p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>

<p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the National Science Board approved merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to apply several specific criteria when reviewing the AMISR proposal. Specifically, the reviewers will be asked to review the extent to which the proposed activities address the Awardee Responsibility and Expectations criteria. Specific attention will be paid to the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scientific merit objectives specific to the AMISR capabilities for either the auroral zone or central polar cap regions:
<ul>
<li>The extent to which the proposed AMISR research effort for each site is focused on a cohesive, well-delineated goal or set of scientific goals for the AMISR user community;</li>
<li>The degree to which the proposed scientific programs, priorities, and technical capabilities address the needs of the AMISR user community while taking advantage of the unique research capabilities of the AMISR observatories within the auroral and central polar cap regions, respectively;</li>
<li>The ability to respond to and prioritize evolving scientific and engineering needs and opportunities as expressed by the AMISR user community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quality and appropriateness of the Management Plan. This includes:
<ul>
<li>The degree to which the proposal presents a management plan with a highly qualified project director that includes engaging with the AMISR user community to specify possible observing strategies for user-defined experiments;</li>
<li>The quality of the proposal plans for dissemination and sharing of data, models, tools and ideas;</li>
<li>The extent to which the proposed management plan provides for the AMISR user community assessment of performance and evaluation of the AMISR facility service to the user community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The extent to which the proposed AMISR broader impact activities are creative and effective:
<ul>
  <li>The appropriateness of the proposed modes of collaboration, training, and outreach to members of the AMISR user community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>

<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Site Visit Review.</p>

<p>The two-step process of the AMISR proposal evaluation would begin with the submission of a preliminary proposal that is evaluated with a panel review. The PIs of the highly-rated preliminary proposals would then be invited in mid-May 2017 to submit full proposals with a deadline for this submission being 3 October, 2017. Upon receipt of the full proposals, an ad hoc mail review would take place followed by a panel review held at NSF that would take place prior to late-November, 2017. A final decision is expected in December, 2017. The reason for having a preliminary proposal phase of this process is to allow NSF to screen the preliminary proposal submissions to select the highly-ranked preliminary proposals for the more intensive full proposal effort expected for a successful facility proposal.</p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p><p>Additional award conditions apply.</p>

<p>The award associated with this solicitation will be a cooperative agreement with the lead institution. Associated collaborators would be supported through subawards. Any special requirements not stated herein will be negotiated at time of award.</p>

<p><strong>Programmatic Terms and Conditions:</strong></p>

<p>The cooperative agreement(s) awarded as a result of this competition will be administered by the NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences. The following are some of the measures NSF envisions using to conduct oversight for any award of a cooperative agreement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Review of annual reports, program plans and performance metrics;</li>
<li>Site visits as necessary;</li>
<li>Annual estimated cost reviews;</li>
<li>Possible Panel Review of AMISR activities and management performance in the third or fourth year of the initial award period.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>

<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>

<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>

<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>

<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>

<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
