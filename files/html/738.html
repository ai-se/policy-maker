<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>NSF is a participating agency of the Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee (FOFC) and subscribes to its fleet renewal plan published in December, 2001 entitled, "Charting a Future for the National Academic Research Fleet: A Long-Range Plan for Renewal." The FOFC Fleet Renewal Plan identified the need for multiple vessel replacements over the next 20 years, including an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV).&nbsp; The highest priority in the Fleet Renewal Plan was replacement of the oldest and smallest federally-owned ocean-going vessel in the fleet, R/V ALPHA HELIX, by a more robust and capable research vessel.&nbsp; NSF supported conceptual designs for such a vessel over many years, leading to a detailed "contract" design in December 2004 which is available at <a href="http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/arrv/constructdesign/contract_specs.pdf">http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/arrv/constructdesign/contract_specs.pdf</a>.&nbsp; Based on strong scientific justification, acquisition of such a vessel was approved by the NSF National Science Board (NSB) as a Major Research Equipment Facilities Construction (MREFC) project in August 2003 (NSB/CPP-03-16).&nbsp;Construction funds were requested in the President&#146;s FY 2007 Budget Request to Congress.&nbsp; Proposers will prepare the contract vessel design completed in December 2004 for shipyard bid to construct the ARRV.&nbsp; Vessel construction and outfitting costs will be split over two fiscal years.</p>
<p>Satellite observations have shown that the perennial ice in the arctic is thinning at a rate of 9 percent per decade, and recent research suggests the thinning is beginning to have major regional and global consequences.&nbsp; Research is urgently needed on topics ranging from climate change, ocean circulation, ecosystem studies and fisheries research to natural hazards and cultural anthropology. Most of these cutting edge science projects require a technologically advanced oceanographic ice-capable platform in the Alaska region to conduct field research and long-term observations.</p>
<p>The ARRV will operate in seasonal sea ice and open ocean regions near Alaska, including Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas, Gulf of Alaska, Prince William Sound and coastal Southeast Alaska.&nbsp;The vessel will operate year round.&nbsp; As we strive to understand a variety of complex regional and global ecosystem and climate issues, the need to conduct research at the ice edge and in seasonal ice (up to 2.5 feet thick) has become increasingly urgent.&nbsp; The ARRV will provide greatly improved access to the region, enabling further exploration to address critical issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The construction of this ship will represent a major NSF contribution to the long-term research objectives of International Polar Year (IPY), by providing the legacy of research infrastructure necessary for future IPY related research.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the increased capability of the ARRV over the existing R/V Alpha Helix, both with regard to its ability to accommodate much larger interdisciplinary research teams and greatly enlarged geographical and seasonal ranges, will stimulate innovative interdisciplinary proposals for research in this area.</p>
<p>Selection of the organization to operate the ARRV does not imply that its staff will have exclusive or favored access to ship use. NSF intends that the Awardee will seek University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) membership (See <a href="http://www.unols.org">http://www.unols.org</a>) and the ship will be scheduled through the UNOLS scheduling process, allowing all interested funded scientists equal access to the facility.&nbsp; The Awardee organization must demonstrate its ability to undertake the successful direction, management and technical oversight of the procurement, construction, scientific outfitting, seatrials and post delivery activities of the vessel, and develop a Project Execution Plan as outlined in the following section.</p>
<p>Post-construction, the Awardee will manage the operations and maintenance of the vessel to support NSF and other Federally-funded research projects. The U.S. government will retain title to the ARRV.</p>
<p>Operational funds for the ARRV will be reviewed and negotiated annually through
  a separate five-year Cooperative Agreement.  </p>
<p>  <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a></p>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) Integrative Program Section (IPS) is soliciting proposals to identify and select an organization to manage the construction of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV), and once constructed, manage the vessel operations to support NSF and other Federally funded science activities. The objective of this open competition is to select the most appropriate Awardee to construct and operate the ARRV on behalf of NSF in support of community wide activities.</p>
<p>A proposal must be compelling, technically sound and must thoroughly address the two major phases: 1) Vessel Construction and 2) Vessel Operations.&nbsp; For the vessel construction phase, the Proposer must demonstrate in the proposal the ability to effectively facilitate and manage the construction contract for the ARRV within cost, schedule and scope criteria. For the vessel operation phase, the Proposer must (1) demonstrate past experience in managing &nbsp;high-latitude vessel&nbsp;operations in support of science and education; and (2) demonstrate in the proposal the ability to accommodate the ship at a docking facility appropriate for a vessel the size and tonnage of the ARRV in order to maintain high quality vessel conditions (NSF will not provide construction or modification funds for docking facility and associated costs).&nbsp; If a Proposer plans to divest itself of an existing UNOLS vessel in order to operate the ARRV, an &quot;end-of-service life&quot; plan should be included in the proposal, including a listing of equipment for cross decking and a financial accounting from any proceeds from vessel sale (if applicable) to be applied towards the ARRV.</p>
<p>NSF notifies proposers that it is the sense of the U.S. Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available by NSF should be American-made.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Vessel Construction</strong></p>
<p>An essential element of the proposal is a conceptual, or preliminary, Project Execution Plan (PEP).&nbsp; After an award is made, the Awardee will refine and fully develop the plan adding all necessary detail.&nbsp; No construction contract can be made by the Awardee until NSF approves the PEP through formal establishment of a project baseline.&nbsp; The PEP will address the following 11 areas of the construction project management. The proposal is only required to address these 11 program management fundamentals conceptually or in outline, but must address how the detailed PEP will be developed within 90 days of the Cooperative Agreement&nbsp;award.</p>
<p>Project Execution Plan Components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Organizational Structure:</strong>&nbsp; The project organization,
      internally and externally, will show clear lines of authority, responsibility
      and communication between NSF, any partners and the Awardee, and will include
      a discussion of all significant interfaces between internal and external
      entities and how these will be coordinated (e.g., how, and how often, will
      interface with the user community be accomplished?).&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizational
      wiring diagrams to demonstrate lines of authority and communication among
      the different performing and oversight entities should be included in the
      PEP.&nbsp; The Awardee must designate one person &ndash; with strong project
      management experience &ndash; to be the Project Director, with overall
      authority and responsibility for the project and interactions with the
      Program Officer.&nbsp; In executing the Project Execution Plan, the Project
      Director manages the project &ldquo;to the baseline&rdquo; (the approved
      cost, schedule and performance requirements), which is a full time job
      and takes a dedicated individual.&nbsp; The Project Director must be supported
      by a competent technical staff committed to the project knowledgeable of
      the principles of sound project management, construction contract negotiation
      and shipyard/building experience, including an Operator's Shipyard Representative
      with demonstratable experience in ship design and construction management.&nbsp; Resumes/CVs
      of the key personnel, or position descriptions if personnel are not yet
      on staff, should be included as an appendix in the PEP to demonstrate qualifications
      of project staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Baseline Project Definition:</strong>&nbsp; This
      contains the project cost, schedule and performance requirements to be
      used as the benchmark against which all progress on the project will be
      measured.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Cost:</strong></em>&nbsp; Estimate of all costs, including inflation in accordance with annual guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (available from NSF&rsquo;s
    Budget Division: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/bud/index.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/bud/index.jsp</a>)
    or other accepted measures and contingency (based on industry standards or
    experience gained from establishing similar facilities) to complete the project.&nbsp; Costs
    for project review and oversight committee meeting reviews should be included
    in project costs.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Schedule:</strong></em>&nbsp; Schedule for the overall project
    and each major subsystem that includes system integration, commissioning,
    acceptance, testing and transition activities; major milestones and milestones
    for reviews (including oversight committee reviews); review reporting, critical
    decisions and deliverables.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em><strong>Performance:</strong></em>&nbsp; Technical characteristics that
    the facility must be capable of performing upon completion in order to meet
    the science or engineering needs.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li>
    <p><strong> Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):</strong>&nbsp; A product-oriented
      grouping of project tasks that organizes and defines the total scope of
      the project. The WBS is a multi-level framework that organizes and displays
      each project component that represents work to be accomplished. Each descending
      level provides detailed definition of a project component. WBS integrates
      and relates all project work (cost, schedule and scope) and is used throughout
      the project management to identify and monitor project process.&nbsp; For
      the proposal, only a system-level WBS is required. For the final Baseline
      Review by NSF, a &quot;bottom-up&quot; contingency
      estimate derived from the WBS will be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Risk Assessment and Management:</strong>&nbsp; Once NSF approves
      a Baseline Project Definition there is an expectation by NSF management,
      the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress that the project will
      be managed by the Awardee, with appropriate oversight by the Program Officer,
      to achieve the stated cost, schedule and performance requirements. Therefore,
      it is essential for the Awardee to analyze the risks associated with achieving
      the Baseline Project Definition early in the process.&nbsp; Risk is an
      inherent part of any project to establish a facility, but diligence in
      assessing and managing the risk affords benefits and opportunities.&nbsp; Risk
      management is a prepared, prescribed, and disciplined approach, focused
      on the necessary steps to determine and control risks to an acceptable
      level.&nbsp; The risk management plans must identify the potential risks
      to the project and document appropriate strategies for managing those risks.&nbsp; Because
      risk management is a continuous process of identifying, analyzing, responding
      to and controlling risks to maximize the potential for success, risk management
      plans must be reviewed and updated periodically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contingency Management:</strong>&nbsp; The Project Manager will
      include &lsquo;risk dollars&rdquo; as
      part of the cost estimate for each WBS component as appropriate. These
      dollars are the project funds reserved to deal with unexpected events during
      the project. The method used should be adapted to the specific needs of
      the project. Contingency is the portion of the project budget that the
      can be held by NSF and/or the Awardee in reserve to accommodate the unknowns
      regarding requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configuration Management and change control:</strong>&nbsp; This
      identifies and defines items in a project, controlling changes of these
      items, controlling and managing through a documented process how requirements
      are to be met. The Awardee is responsible for establishing a program, conducting
      inspections and retaining records of the inspections conducted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program:</strong>&nbsp; The
      awardee is responsible for establishing a program, conducting inspections
      and retaining records of the inspections conducted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Safety, Environmental and Health Issues:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      Awardee must develop a plan that addresses safety, health, environment
      and quality issues and is integrated throughout all the project phases.
      This plan will ensure that worker, environmental and public safety is appropriately
      addressed in performing every task, and include plans for securing human
      subjects clearances, if applicable (e.g., assessments of education-related
      activities).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Also
      discuss any likely environmental permitting requirements, if applicable
      (e.g,. marine mammals).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Financial and Business Operations Controls</strong>:&nbsp; Controls
      will be used to ensure that the project is in compliance with NSF policies
      and procedures and Federal regulations.&nbsp; Earned
      Value Reporting and a Document Control Center amongst other safeguards
      will be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plans for System Integration, Commissioning, Testing and Acceptance:</strong>&nbsp; The
      Project Director establishes a turnover, occupancy, and acceptance process
      that includes a punch list item resolution, user walk-downs, verification
      of compliance with project requirements, system startup for proper operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plans for transitioning from construction and/or acquisition to operations:</strong>&nbsp; A
      planned, structured and organized project transition includes the identification
      of the budget necessary for required activities, as well as adequate staffing.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>As noted above, the proposal is only required to address these 11 program
    management fundamentals conceptually or in outline, but must address how
    the detailed Project Execution Plan will be developed within 90 days of the
    Cooperative Agreement&nbsp;award. Once the Cooperative Agreement is negotiated, the Awardee will establish an external group subject to NSF approval to assist the Awardee by reviewing the scientific merit of project-specific plans and processes including, but not limited to, cost and schedule realism, adequacy of budgeted contingency, and review of organizational structure and management.&nbsp; This group should provide guidance to the Awardee during the development of the PEP for the project baseline review.&nbsp; The Awardee will promptly provide NSF with any reports and/or guidance provided to it by the external group and report on Awardee responses/actions. The PEP will be submitted to NSF for review prior to the selection of a ship construction bid and before the release and expenditure of any construction funds. The Baseline Review will be conducted prior to the commencement of actual construction, following the award of the contract to the successful construction bidder.&nbsp; For
    the Baseline Review, the topics listed in Appendix 4 of the NSF <em>Guidelines for Planning and Managing the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) Account</em>,
    must be fully addressed (Available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/docs/mrefcguidelines06.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/docs/mrefcguidelines06.pdf</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Vessel Operations</strong></p>
<p>The proposal must include:</p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
  <li>
    <p> Description of scientific use visualized for the vessel, which includes
      likely involvement of scientists and educators of the proposing institution(s),
      other likely users such as outreach programs (i.e., those promoting education
      and diversity), and sponsoring federal and state agencies; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Description
      of the Awardee's experience and demonstrated successful track record of
      the effective management of an oceanographic research vessel, including

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p id="reviewcrit" name="reviewcrit"><a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>    </p>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and,
  if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals
  are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an
  NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF
  who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These
  reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the
  review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe
  are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would
  prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in
  the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission
  of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers
  have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p id="reviewproc" name="reviewproc"><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>    </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    
    <strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
    within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the
    proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the
    reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does
    the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How
    well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient
    access to resources?  </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    
    <em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it
    supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide
    abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities
    as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts
    that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research
    through the diversity of learning perspectives.  </p>
  <p>  <em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
    is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is
    committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</strong></h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span class="input"></span><span class="input">Ad hoc, Panel, Internal NSF, and/or Site Visit Reviews</span>.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="input">Use of one or a combination of the review methods (Ad hoc, Panel, Internal NSF and/or Site Visit) will be decided by the Program Director in consultation with the OCE Division Director.</span></p>
    <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
    <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
    <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
    <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
    <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
    <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
    <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
    <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
    <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)
    <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
    <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
    <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.
    <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
    <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Grant Policy Manual</em> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong><span class="input">
      &nbsp;The award associated with this solicitation will be a Cooperative Agreement that will fund vessel construction and associated construction activities that will lead to final vessel delivery and acceptance.</span></p>
    <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
    <h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
    
    <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
    <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
    <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p><span class="input"><p><strong>Additional reporting requirements</strong></p>
  <p>A construction contract and related subawards cannot be entered into without the approval of NSF and without NSF's review and approval of a PEP.</p>
  <p>Prior to vessel construction, frequent communication between the PI and the NSF&nbsp;Program Director will be expected. &nbsp;In addition to annual and final reports, during vessel construction, weekly interim project reports submitted via FastLane to the cognizant NSF Program Director will be required.&nbsp; More detailed reports, addressing&nbsp;such issues as project progress, project timelines, budget, and any deviations from the&nbsp;original vessel design will be required on a monthly basis during vessel construction and will also be submitted via FastLane as interim reports.&nbsp; Failure to provide interim project reports may also delay NSF review and processing of future funding increments and pending proposals for that PI.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

        <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is
          solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act
          of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used
          in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project
          reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and
          reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information
          requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants
          as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees
          to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award
          decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors,
          experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete
          assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing
          information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application
          review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to
          another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative
          proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal
          Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select
          potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee
          members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69
          Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information
          is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however,
          may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.
        <p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.
