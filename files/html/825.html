          <P> <B>Q. I am a little unsure of the difference between the Leadership 
            and the Institutional Transformation awards. Could you give me some 
            clarification?</b></P>

<P><B>A.</b> To a certain extent, it's a matter of scale. The Institutional Transformation awards require cost sharing, evaluation mechanisms, and negotiation with NSF. The expectation is that institutions receiving these awards will initiate and sustain organizational change. These are likely to be large, complex efforts. The Leadership awards are probably most appropriate for smaller-scale efforts, or for use by an individual or organization that has developed some "home grown" programs that need funding to scale-up and institutionalize.</P>

          <P><B>Q. Can the application include more than one school of the University 
            and, if so, do all the schools included in the application need to 
            award degrees in a NSF-supported field? </b></P>
          <P><B>A. </b>Yes, the application can include more than one school of 
            the University; all of the schools included in the application do 
            not need to award degrees in a NSF-supported field. It is important 
            to remember in preparing your application that the goal of ADVANCE 
            is specific to advancing women in academic science and engineering 
            careers, and proposals will be evaluated with that in mind. </P>
          <B> 
          <P><B>Q.</b> If an application includes more than one school, do they 
            all need to be within the same NSF Directorate (e.g. Biological Sciences)?</P>
          </B> 
          <P><B>A.</b> No.</P>
          <P><B>Q. Are schools that award professional degrees, MD, DMD and/or 
            MS degrees, eligible to apply?</b></P>
          <P><B>A.</b> NSF, in general, does not support work in the biomedical 
            fields. For clarification, check the Grant Proposal Guide (<A HREF="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf012/nsf0102_1.html">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf012/nsf0102_1.html)</A>, 
            which specifies that research with disease-related goals, including 
            work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental 
            disease, abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or animals, is 
            normally not supported. Animal models of such conditions or the development 
            or testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also are 
            not eligible for support. However, research in bioengineering, with 
            diagnosis or treatment-related goals that applies engineering principles 
            to problems in biology and medicine while advancing engineering knowledge 
            is eligible for support. Bioengineering research to aid persons with 
            disabilities also is eligible. </P>
          <P>Given this context, schools that award only professional degrees 
            (MD, DMD) would generally not be eligible; schools awarding PhDs or 
            MS degrees in science and engineering fields supported by NSF in the 
            biomedical sciences would be eligible. <B>&nbsp;</b></P>

          <P><B>Q. Should the PI be a research scientist or an administrator (Provost, 
            Director of Research, Dean)?</b></P>



<P><B>A.</b> The PI should be the person most likely to effect change. There

is no expectation or requirement that the PI is in a senior administrative

position. There is an expectation that the institution will support the PI in

his/her efforts, and that commitment might well come from a provost or

president.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

          <P><b>Q. Is the ADVANCE Program designed specifically to support women 
            faculty members, or will the Foundation also consider programs aimed 
            at promising young scholars earlier in the pipeline (graduate students 
            or undergraduates)?</b></P>



          <P><B>A.</b> ADVANCE is targeted at moving women up in the ranks of science and 
            engineering faculty. Activities that include approaches to supporting 
            graduate or undergraduate students could be proposed provided there 
            is a clear connection to how that can be expected to increase the 
            number of women in the professoriate.

        <DIR> 
          <P><b>Q. I am working with a group to develop a proposal for the NSF 
            ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Awards. One of the items listed 
            as a potential supportable activity is the establishment of chaired 
            professorships that support the goal of ADVANCE. Can you provide additional 
            details on the guidelines and restrictions regarding the establishment 
            of such chaired professorships? Typically at our institution, chaired 
            professorships are established via an endowment and I was wondering 
            how NSF might award money for such chairs. </b></P>
          <P><B>A.</b> NSF has no guidelines on precise mechanisms for establishing 
            chaired professorships; that item is listed to encourage institutions 
            to put together partnerships that would, together with the NSF funds, 
            allow for creative and substantive approaches to increasing the number 
            of women in S&amp;E at the senior ranks. NSF, as a government agency, 
            does not have the flexibility that private foundations might to create 
            such positions, and NSF funds have many restrictions on how they can 
            be used. For example, while NSF funds may not be used to create an 
            endowment, they may be used to support the salary of a faculty member 
            in a chaired professorship. It is our hope that at the end of the 
            award period, the chaired position would be fully supported by funds 
            raised by the institution from other sources.</P>

          <P><b>Q. We plan to submit a proposal for institutional transformation 
            with a total budget requested from NSF of $750,000 annually, as allowed 
            in the guidelines. Do we count the 20% required cost-sharing as part 
            of that amount, or would the 20% be in addition to the NSF funds, 
            for a total annual budget of $900,000?</b></P>

<P><B>A.</b> Cost sharing of 20% of the requested total amount of NSF funds is required for Institutional Transformation Award proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation. If you are requesting $750,000 annually from NSF, the institutional cost sharing would be $150,000 annually, for a total annual project budget of $900,000.</P>
