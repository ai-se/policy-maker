<center><b>NSF Dear Colleague Letter<br>
AWARE<br>
American Workforce and Research and Education</b></font></center></p>

May 25, 2001

<P>Dear Colleague:</P>

<P>I would like to inform you about an opportunity to seek NSF funding to
develop research and educational ties in East Asia.  If you currently are a
recipient of an NSF award from the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12
Education (GK-12) Program, the Integrative Graduate Education and Research
Training (IGERT) Program, the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Program, or for an NSF-supported Center, you are eligible to apply for
support under the "AWARE" component of NSF’s East Asia and Pacific Program
(EAP). AWARE stands for <U>American Workforce and Research and Education</U>.
The purpose of AWARE is to develop a globally knowledgeable and confident
American scientific and engineering workforce.  AWARE is currently focused on
East Asia.  </P>

<P>Please refer to the EAP Home Page (<A
HREF="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/int/eap/start.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/int/eap/start.htm</A>) for a description of the kinds of activities that may be supported under AWARE.  There you will also find a description of  the elements that should be included in your supplemental request through FastLane to the Program Officer responsible for your current grant, and the criteria that will be used to arrive at award decisions.</P>

<P>If you should have any questions, please contact the responsible EAP
Program Officer(s) listed in the EAP Home Page for the country or
geographical area of East Asia in which you are interested.</P>

<P>The contact for additional information is <A

<P>General inquiries about the Dear Colleague Letter should be directed to
Alexander P. De Angelis (<A

Desk, telephone, 800.673.6188, e-mail <A
HREF="mailto:fastlane@nsf.gov">fastlane@nsf.gov</A>.</P>

<P>Only requests from current awardees from Principal Investigators of
NSF–supported Centers, REU sites, GK-12 grants and IGERT grants will be
considered. The number of requests funded will depend on the availability of
funds.</P>

<B><P>About the National Science Foundation</P>
</B>

<P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in most
fields of science and engineering.  Awardees are wholly responsible for
conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
publication.  Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such
findings or their interpretation.</P>

<P>NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
educators.  The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
with disabilities to compete fully in its programs.  In accordance with
Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of race,
color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
from NSF (unless otherwise specified in the eligibility requirements for a
particular program). </P>

<P>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED)
provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with
disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects.  See the program
announcement/solicitation for further information.</P>

<P>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD)
and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable
individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about
NSF programs, employment or general information.  TDD may be accessed at
(703) 292-5090, FIRS at 1-800-877-8339.</P>

<P>The National Science Foundation is committed to making all of the
information we publish easy to understand.  If you have a suggestion about
how to improve the clarity of this document or other NSF-published materials,
please contact us at <A

<P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is
solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950,
as amended.  The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted by
awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the
Executive Branch and to Congress.  The information requested may be disclosed
to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review
process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data
regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration
of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and
educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government
agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order to
coordinate programs; and to another Federal agency, court or party in a court
or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party.
Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file
and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or
advisory committee members.  </P>

<P>See Systems of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/ Proposal File and
Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51,
"Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268
(January 5, 1998).  Submission of the information is voluntary.  Failure to
provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the  possibility
of receiving an award.</P>

<P>Pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(b), an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a
