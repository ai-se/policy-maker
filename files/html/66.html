        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Biological Anthropology Program supports multifaceted research to advance scientific knowledge of human biology and ecology, including understanding of our evolutionary history and mechanisms that have shaped human and nonhuman primate biological diversity. Supported research focuses on living and fossil forms of both human and nonhuman primates, addressing time scales ranging from the short-term to evolutionary, encompassing multiple levels of analysis (e.g., molecular, organismal, population, ecosystem), conducted in field, laboratory, captive, and computational research environments, and often incorporating interactions between human biology and culture.  <br />
              <br />
              Areas of inquiry that promote understanding of the evolution, biology, and adaptability of our diverse species include, but are not limited to: genetic/epigenetic/genomic variation and relationship to phenotype; ecology and socioecology; functional anatomy and skeletal biology; and paleoanthropology and primate paleontology. Multidisciplinary research that integrates biological anthropology with related anthropological fields, such as archaeology, cultural anthropology, and forensic anthropology, also receives support through the Program.</p>
            <p>The Program contributes to the integration of education and basic research through support of dissertation projects conducted by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. universities.  <strong>This solicitation specifically addresses the preparation and evaluation of proposals for such Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grants.</strong>  Dissertation research projects in all of the subareas of biological anthropology are eligible for support through these grants.  These awards are intended to enhance and improve the conduct of dissertation research by doctoral students who are pursuing research in biological anthropology that enhances basic scientific knowledge.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Biological Anthropology Program supports multifaceted basic research which advances scientific knowledge of humans as biological organisms, within an evolutionary framework and with adaptation as a central theoretical theme. The Program contributes to the integration of such basic research with education through support of dissertation projects conducted by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. universities.  <strong>This solicitation specifically addresses the preparation and evaluation of proposals for such Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grants submitted to the Biological Anthropology Program.</strong> </p>
          <p>Dissertation projects in all of the subareas of basic scientific research in biological anthropology, whether conducted in specialized facilities or field settings, are eligible for support through these grants. These awards are intended to provide support that will enhance and improve the conduct of dissertation research by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. universities.</p>
   
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Proposals eligible for support through the Biological Anthropology Program fall within the scope of basic research that advances scientific knowledge of human biology and ecology, including understanding of our evolutionary history and mechanisms that have shaped human and nonhuman primate biological diversity. Supported research focuses on living and fossil forms of both human and nonhuman primates, addressing time scales ranging from the short-term to evolutionary, encompassing multiple levels of analysis (e.g., molecular, organismal, population, ecosystem), and conducted in field, laboratory, captive, and computational research environments. </p>
          <p>Areas of inquiry that promote understanding of the evolution, biology, and adaptability of our diverse species include, but are not limited to: genetic/epigenetic/genomic variation and relationship to phenotype; ecology and socioecology; functional anatomy and skeletal biology; and paleoanthropology and primate paleontology. Multidisciplinary research that integrates biological anthropology with related fields, including but not limited to archaeology, cultural anthropology, and forensic anthropology, also may receive support through the Program and may be co-reviewed by relevant programs.</p>
          <p>NSF does not support research on the etiology, diagnosis, or treatment of disease; research focused on basic ecological, biological and behavioral processes that underlie health and disease in humans and non-human primates, however, may be eligible for support. Projects funded through the Program exemplify contributions to theoretical and conceptual insights within biological anthropology that might inform understanding of societal concerns, such as adaptability to environmental stresses and global change.</p>
          <p>DDRIG proposals are accepted in all of the research areas encompassed by the Program and utilizing any of the diversity of research approaches to investigations within the discipline.  It is expected that the research, whether hypothesis- or discovery-driven, will have a strong conceptual foundation and contribute to the advancement of theory and knowledge in biological anthropology beyond that of the highly-focused research topic. This expectation extends to the <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the research; meritorious proposals clearly, creatively, and strongly demonstrate the implications of the research for advancing education and informing issues of broader societal importance, as appropriate to the topic and scale of the research.</p>
          <p>Proposals for dissertation research are not expected to support the full costs of the student's research.  These awards are intended to provide supplemental funds for items not normally available from the student's university or other funding sources.  Allowable items include travel to research facilities/field sites distant from the student's institution, costs for data-collection activities integral to the project, purchase of research supplies and services not otherwise available through the institution, the hiring of field or laboratory assistants if warranted by the scope of the research, fees for use of specialized research equipment or research facilities, and research fees imposed for international fieldwork.  <strong>Funds may not be used</strong> for stipends or salary for the doctoral student or their advisor(s), tuition, textbooks or journals, dissertation preparation or publication costs, travel by the faculty advisor to the research site or to professional meetings, or travel by the student to professional meetings.</p>
          <p>DDRI awards may be for one or two years in duration, with all costs to be covered by received funds reimbursed during this award period.  <strong>Proposals may request up to $20,000 in Direct Costs.</strong> There are no Indirect Cost limitations; proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are subject to the awardee's current Federally-negotiated indirect cost rate.  <strong>Please note that indirect costs are in addition to the maximum direct cost request of up to $20,000</strong>.

        <p>See Chapter II.C.2 of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> for guidance on the required sections of a full research proposal submitted to NSF. Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions.</p>
        <p>For the following listed sections of the proposal, elaborations, emphases, and <strong>instructions specific to DDRI proposals under this solicitation</strong> are presented:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Cover Page</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Begin the Project Title on the Cover Page with "<strong>Doctoral Dissertation Research:</strong>" followed by a brief title of the dissertation research project.  This title should correspond to the title for any required applications for IRB and/or IACUC approval of the specific dissertation project. Use concise, straight-forward language that conveys the core research objective of the project such that a scientifically or technically literate reader could understand that core scientific contribution.</li>
          <li>Select the specific number of this BA-DDRIG solicitation in the section labeled Program Announcement/Solicitation/Program Description.</li>
          <li>Verify that the NSF Unit of Consideration is "BCS-DDRI Bio Anthro".</li>
          <li>List the primary dissertation advisor as the PI and list the doctoral student (and other advisors, only if highly appropriate to the conduct of the research) as Co-PI(s) in the Remainder of the Cover Sheet section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>2. Project Description</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The text of the Project Description is limited to <strong>10 single-spaced pages</strong>. Up to <strong>5 additional pages</strong> at the end of the Project Description can be used for presentation of graphics (non-textual material), including maps, figures, and photographs essential to presentation of the project. Tables may be included in these additional pages, but should be highly concise, quantitative, and absent lengthy captions and explanatory statements. Captions for all graphics must be short and without textual elaborations.  Each of these must be referenced within the text of the 10-page Project Description.</li>
          <li>The 'Results from Prior Support' section is not required.</li>
          <li>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) should not be included within the Project Description, for reasons provided in the NSF PAPPG related to the requirement that this section be self-contained.</li>
          <li>The Project Description should incorporate discussion of the scientific significance of the project and the relevant theoretical framework(s) and literature (including significance of the research to biological anthropology beyond informing the focused area of inquiry, as well as any distinct transformative potential), detailed presentation of the research question(s) to be addressed, and details of the research design, analyses and interpretation.</li>
          <li>In preparation of the required, separate section on Broader Impacts, discussion of the improvement of graduate student training (that of the Co-PI) can be included, but investigators should go beyond this in delineating impacts generated by the research itself, through activities related to the research, or activities that are supported by, but are complementary to the project.  These should be appropriate to the size and scope of the research, but are expected to illustrate that significant thought has been applied to consideration of the impact of the research as it may inform or advance societally-relevant outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>3. Budget</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Permitted budget items include: travel to research facilities/field sites distant from the student's institution, costs for data-collection activities integral to the project, purchase of research supplies and services not otherwise available through the institution, the hiring of field or laboratory assistants if warranted by the scope of the research, fees for use of specialized research equipment or research facilities, and research fees imposed for international fieldwork.</li>
          <li><strong>Funds may not be used</strong> for stipends or salary for the doctoral student or their advisor(s), tuition, textbooks or journals, dissertation preparation or publication costs, travel by the faculty advisor to the research site or to professional meetings, or travel by the student to professional meetings.</li>
          <li>Since salaries or stipends for the doctoral student or their advisor(s) are not eligible for support, after the PI and Co-PI(s) are entered on the Cover Page, their names must be manually removed from the Senior Personnel listing on the budget pages. This is to avoid construal as voluntary committed cost sharing, which is not permitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Other Supplementary Documents</strong></p>
        <p>The BA-DDRIG solicitation includes a <strong>required statement from the Principal Investigator</strong> that must be uploaded to this section. This <strong>signed </strong>statement from the doctoral student's major advisor or other faculty member serving as the PI affirms that 1) s/he has actively mentored the student throughout the production of the proposal, 2) s/he has read the final, submitted version of that proposal, and 3) the proposal represents a strong case for support of the dissertation research project.</p>
        <p>The following <strong>template must be used</strong> to prepare the statement; the only changes permitted are provision of information where there are blank lines in the template.  Additional text is <strong>not</strong> permitted.  The statement should be prepared and then <strong>signed</strong> by the PI; the scanned document can then be uploaded into the Other Supplementary Documents section.  Electronic signature or its equivalent will be permitted only in highly unusual, fully supported circumstances; prior written approval of the Program Director for the Biological Anthropology Program is required before such substitution of the PI's real signature.</p>
        <p><strong>Required template for the PI's signed statement:</strong></p>
        <p>TO:  NSF Biological Anthropology Program</p>
        <p>FROM:  _______________________________ <em>(insert typed/printed name of the PI)</em></p>
        <p>By signing below, I acknowledge that I am the listed Principal Investigator on this proposal, entitled "_________________________" <em>(insert title of the DDRI proposal from the Cover Page)</em>, with my doctoral student advisee ___________________________ <em>(insert typed/printed name of the Co-PI</em>) as the Co-Principal Investigator.</p>
        <p>I affirm that the student Co-PI has advanced to a stage in her/his doctoral program where submission of a finalized dissertation proposal is appropriate, and that the student will be able to undertake the dissertation research project described in this proposal promptly after any award of funding (as indicated by the proposed starting date on the Cover Page).</p>
        <p><strong>I affirm that 1) I have actively mentored the student throughout the production of the proposal, 2) I have read the final, submitted version of this proposal, and 3) in my estimation, the proposal represents a strong case for support of the dissertation research project through NSF funding.</strong> </p>
        <p>Signed:  ________________________________________ <em>(must be signed by the PI)</em></p>
        <p>University Affiliation:  _____________________________&shy;_ <em>(insert university name)</em></p>
        <p>Date: __________________________ <em>(insert date that the statement is signed by the PI)</em></p>
    
        <p><strong>Letters of Collaboration </strong></p>
        <p>If the dissertation project involves collaboration on the part of individuals and/or organizations in order to carry-out the activities and achieve the research goals, <strong><em>brief</em></strong> statements (in the form of letters or free-standing email messages) may be included in this section (Other Supplementary Documents).  These must be statements of intent to collaborate and/or commit resources as detailed in the Project Description or the Facilities, Equipment or Other Resources section of the proposal; statements submitted for inclusion in the proposal cannot be altered in any way without the author's explicit prior approval.  Such statements must <strong>not</strong> be letters of recommendation in support of the project, nor should they include elaboration of the collaborative activities beyond what has been presented in the Project Description.  These are solely to attest to willingness to collaborate or commit resources such as access to research facilities.</p>
        <p><strong>5.  Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Approvals</strong></p>
        <p>If the project requires approval by one or both of these entities (the research involves human subjects and/or vertebrate animals), proper certification is required.  If approval of the research has not been obtained prior to submission, the proposer should indicate 'Pending' in the space provided on the Cover Sheet for the approval date.  If a decision is made to recommend the proposal for funding, an official copy of the IRB and/or IACUC approval letter must be submitted to the Program Director.  If the research has been deemed exempt from IRB/IACUC review, this must be affirmed by the IRB/IACUC or appropriate knowledgeable authority designated by the submitting organization, not the PI.  The approval document must identify the DDRI project specifically, and the stated expiration date of the approval should extend a minimum of 6 months beyond the start date of the project. Additional information about IRB and IACUC policies and procedures is available in the PAPPG.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
    <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

(See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
         <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
         <h4>
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
