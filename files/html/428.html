        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Buildings are a significant part of our nation's civil infrastructure for our welfare, livelihood, security, and safety.  Buildings exist in an economic, social, technological, and natural context.  They must be designed for resilience to the multiple natural hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, windstorms (e.g., hurricanes and tornadoes), and floods, which may be experienced over their lifespan.  Their design must also accommodate emerging societal goals for sustainability to reduce their impact on the natural environment.  This high performance for multi-hazard resiliency and sustainability requires a comprehensive understanding of the risks, costs, and opportunities for a range of decisions, from choosing the building materials to designing the many systems comprising the building.  Among these systems, the building's soil-foundation-structural-envelope (SFSE) system is critical to maintain the integrity and functionality of the building to protect occupants and the interior.   </p>
            <p>The goal of the Decision Frameworks for Multi-Hazard Resilient and Sustainable Buildings (RSB) solicitation is to advance knowledge for new concepts for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems using decision frameworks for selection among alternative building system designs.  Research for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems supported under the this solicitation must include the consideration of a rational decision framework, preferences, concepts for SFSE systems, and design optimization methods for generating and choosing among alternative SFSE systems.</p>
            <p>Multidisciplinary collaborations are essential for this research.  Proposals must broadly integrate across the fields of architecture; engineering; material, environmental, social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and other disciplines necessary to address the research scope.  Research supported under this solicitation may include computational, analytical, and/or experimental work.  Research may also undertake the collection of new data or the use of existing data, but the data must be integral to the decision framework.  This solicitation does not support research that generically addresses materials research or decision frameworks outside the context of decision making for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems.   </p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Every day, each of us interacts with buildings, spending 90 per cent of our time indoors.  Buildings - commercial, residential, industrial, and public - are a significant part of our nation's civil infrastructure for our welfare, livelihood, productivity, continuity of operations, shelter, safety, and security.  Buildings have evolved into complex systems, comprised of many different materials, components, and systems for the exterior and interior, to support the intended function.  Among these elements are the load-bearing components (soil-foundation-structural system), building envelope (e.g., roof, exterior wall panels, windows, and doors), and interior components such as ceilings, floors, walls, and partitions and mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems.  The building life cycle, i.e., siting, planning, design, construction, maintenance, use, operation, deconstruction, and recycling and reuse to minimize waste, adds to this complexity.    </p>
          <p>Buildings exist in an economic, social, technological, and natural context.  If they are designed, engineered, constructed, and operated in a way that fits this context, they can strengthen our urban fabric and contribute to the achievement of broader societal goals.  High performance requires a comprehensive understanding of the risks, costs, and opportunities over a broad range of decisions - from the selection of the building materials to the integration of the various building systems - to enable buildings that are resilient to the various natural hazards experienced over their lifetime and that meet emerging societal goals for sustainability. </p>
          <p>The building's soil-foundation-structural-envelope (SFSE) system protects the occupants and interior of the building.  The SFSE building system is integral to providing resilience during a natural hazard event and for contributing toward sustainability.  During its lifespan, the building may be subject to earthquakes, tsunamis, windstorms (e.g., hurricanes and tornadoes), floods, and other natural hazards.  Over the past several decades, damage to SFSE building systems resulting from natural hazard events has led to loss of building function and occupancy, causing a cascading disaster to the community.  Historically, research on building materials, design, and performance has focused on structural system resilience for a single natural hazard.  Considerably less research has been undertaken toward understanding resilience for an integrated SFSE building system under a variety of different natural hazard loadings.  Buildings designed to be multi-hazard resilient will contribute toward broader societal goals for communities to recover rapidly from natural disturbances.  Strategies for green buildings are emerging, addressing societal goals for a sustainable nation, in which human needs are met and the built environment is provided for without harm to the natural environment and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  These buildings have included features such as sustainable materials, minimization of non-renewable energy use during the building life cycle, use of on-site renewable energy source(s), and maximization of material reuse and recyclable components.  However, current building system designs for single hazard resilience do not always take advantage of new technologies for sustainable buildings and do not provide multi-hazard resilience.    </p>
          <p>Decision frameworks and greater collaboration among architects, engineers, and material, environmental, social, behavioral, and economic scientists are needed to ensure that buildings are more than the sum of the parts so that they can meet current and future challenges for multi-hazard resilience and sustainability.  The Decision Frameworks for Multi-hazard Resilient and Sustainable Buildings (RSB) solicitation supports research to create new concepts for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems and decision frameworks that will enable comparison of alternative SFSE system designs to achieve both multi-hazard resiliency and sustainability.     </p>

        </h3>
         
          <p> <strong>A.  Research Program</strong></p>
          <p>The goal of the RSB program is to advance knowledge for new concepts for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems using decision frameworks for selection among alternative SFSE system designs.  Decision frameworks can provide better understanding of the potential gains for design for both multi-hazard resiliency and sustainability.  Research areas of interest encompass  the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are rational decision frameworks for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems? </li>
            <li>What are preference attributes for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems?</li>
            <li>How are stakeholder preferences considered?</li>
            <li>What are appropriate analysis abstractions to support broad decision space exploration?</li>
            <li>What are design concepts (alternatives) for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems?  For example, alternatives might consider:  (a) multi-functional, performance-driven sustainable materials, (b) new configurations developed from existing and/or new sustainable materials, and (c) smart building technologies and decision support systems integrated with (a) or (b) to provide information on building health or damage to assess remaining structural integrity following a natural hazard event.</li>
            <li>How can uncertainty be quantified in the decision framework?</li>
            <li>What are high-fidelity computational models to capture multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building system performance?</li>
            <li>What are design optimization processes for generating and choosing among alternative multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems?</li>
            <li>What are the organizational, social, psychological, legal, political and economic obstacles for providing multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems and what might be strategies for overcoming these obstacles?</li>
            <li>What is the role of multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems in the context of community multi-hazard resilience and sustainability? </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposals submitted to this solicitation <strong>must</strong> explicitly address each of the following topics in the research plan:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A decision framework for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable SFSE building systems that addresses preferences, concept generation (alternative SFSE system designs), analysis, uncertainty quantification, and design optimization.</li>
            <li>Description of and rationale for the multi-hazards considered.</li>
            <li>Description of and rationale for the sustainability metrics considered.</li>
            <li>Description and scope of the SFSE system considered.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Research projects should productively cross the boundaries of architecture; engineering; materials science; environmental science; social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and other disciplines necessary for the research scope.  Projects supported under this solicitation may undertake the collection of new data or the use of existing curated data, but the data must be integral to the decision framework. Research may include computational work, analytical work and/or experimental work.   This solicitation will not support the following:  (a) materials research investigated in absence of explicitly considered SFSE building system(s), such as materials research supported through existing NSF programs, solicitations, and Dear Colleague Letters issued by the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Division of Materials Research, and the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, and (b) investigation of fire and/or blast loading as part of the multiple hazards considered.</p>
          <p>NSF support for operations of the current George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) experimental facilities and cyberinfrastructure, described at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nees.org">http://www.nees.org</a>, ends on September 30, 2014, when the five-year NSF cooperative agreement for NEES operations with Purdue University expires.  Under a separate program solicitation to be issued in fiscal year (FY) 2014, NSF will solicit proposals in a separate competition for operations of a multi-user facility entitled the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI). Preliminary information about this facility is described in NSF Dear Colleague Letter 14-054, "Support for Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure and Research during FY 2015-FY 2019.&rdquo;  Awards made through this solicitation may use NHERI resources after NHERI is established in early FY 2015.</p>
          <p>NSF is one of four Federal agencies participating in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) (<a href="http://www.nehrp.gov">http://www.nehrp.gov</a>) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).  Awards supported under this program solicitation that investigate earthquakes and windstorms as part of the multiple natural hazards considered will contribute to NSF&rsquo;s contributions to NEHRP and NWIRP, respectively.</p>
          <p><strong>B.  International Collaboration</strong></p>
          <p>NSF encourages collaboration with foreign researchers. Proposals including international collaboration should (a) identify the names and affiliations of the international collaborators, (b) describe the nature and goals of collaborative activities, (c) highlight the synergies and benefits to be gained from the collaboration, and (d) describe the international collaborators' current or anticipated resources that will be available to the project.  International collaborators cannot be funded under this solicitation and must provide their own support.  Two international collaborations have been identified through recent single natural hazard workshops and may be a resource; however, proposers are cautioned that proposals that only focus on a single natural hazard will be returned without review.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>International Collaboration with Researchers using Japan's E-Defense Shake Table Facility:   The 3-D Full-Scale Earthquake Testing Shake Table Facility, known as E-Defense, (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.bosai.go.jp/hyogo/ehyogo/">http://www.bosai.go.jp/hyogo/ehyogo/</a>), built by the Japanese National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), opened for research in 2005.  Proposals may be submitted to this solicitation that plan to use the E-Defense shake table in the conduct of the research.  Proposals must include letter(s) of support verifying the availability of the E-Defense facility for the proposed research.  Research topics of mutual interest to researchers in Japan and the United States have been identified through recent workshops (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nees.org">http://www.nees.org</a>).</li>
            <li>International Collaboration with Academic Researchers Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC):   Recent NSFC/NSF sponsored workshops have identified priority research topics for joint collaboration (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nees.org">http://www.nees.org</a>).  Proposals must provide letters of support from the Chinese counterparts verifying the collaboration. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>C.  Software Development</strong></p>
          <p>Proposals may include software development to support the research activities.  This solicitation requires open source software development regardless of the intended use or application.  Proposals with a software development component must include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rationale for this software based on analysis of capabilities of existing software tools.</li>
            <li>Specific examples and use cases of how use of the software is integral to RSB research.</li>
            <li>Preliminary user requirements.</li>
            <li>Summary of the software development process, including user manual and documentation.</li>
            <li>Plan for maintenance of the software beyond the NSF award period.</li>
            <li>Plan for use of the software by the natural hazards engineering community beyond the proposal team.</li>
            <li>Expected annual user base.</li>
            <li>Identification of the open source license to be used.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>D.  Data Management Plan</strong></p>
          <p>The NSF-required Data Management Plan must include a plan for archiving in the NEHRI operations awardee's data repository all experimental data generated as part of the research supported under this solicitation.  The data archiving must follow the data archiving and curation policies to be announced and implemented by the NHERI operations awardee.  All experimental data must be archived, regardless of the experimental facility used to generate the data.  The NHERI data repository is expected to be made operational on/about May 2015.   Data in this context refers to all measurements, calibrations, observations, analyses, images, commentary, reports, logs, notes, and electronic notebook entries that relate directly to the proposed experiments.  Any data (as described above) that are recorded in hardcopy of any form must be transcribed or converted, without loss of information, to electronic media using an appropriate searchable format. Hybrid simulation involving experimental and computational components must also include computational data recorded as output of the experiments conducted, and models and software codes used.  In addition, this information must be properly characterized with appropriate metadata descriptors and then subsequently stored into one of the NHERI operations awardee's accepted digital formats to facilitate archiving.  For purposes of establishing a level of effort required for data archiving and curation, proposers may base their plan on the current NEES operations awardee's Data Sharing and Archiving Policies available at  <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://nees.org/resources/6218/download/Data_Sharing_and_Archiving_Policy_20130501.pdf">http://nees.org/resources/6218/download/Data_Sharing_and_Archiving_Policy_20130501.pdf</a></p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

         <h4>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
      <p>  Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
   
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
