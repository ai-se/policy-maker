<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>
<p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding opportunity. Proposers who opt to submit prior to January 18, 2011, must also follow the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG has been revised to implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing.&nbsp; Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal.&nbsp; The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information.&nbsp; Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director.&nbsp; See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) </em>Chapter II.C.2.g(xi) for further information about the implementation of these&nbsp;recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG contains a clarification of NSF's long standing data policy.&nbsp; All proposals must describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans.&nbsp; FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan.&nbsp; The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as appropriate.&nbsp;Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>. See Chapter II.C.2.j of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.&nbsp; Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan. See Chapter II.C.2.j of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Notes:</strong></p>
<p>This solicitation has one new requirement. Each proposal must include a letter(s) from the participating industry partner(s)&nbsp;detailing measurable industry collaboration (degree and extent to which the industry will be&nbsp;involved with the proposed research).&nbsp; Proposals not meeting this requirement&nbsp;will be returned without review as being non-responsive.</p>
<p>No other changes were made from the previous release of  <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf10507">NSF 10-507</a>.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) program develops long-term partnerships among industry, academe, and government. The centers are catalyzed by a small investment from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and are primarily supported by center members, with NSF taking a supporting role in their development and evolution. I/UCRCs stimulate highly leveraged industry/university cooperation by focusing on research recommended by their Industrial Advisory Boards (IAB) whose members are companies and other organizations that help support a center's research activities.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Research Program for I/UCRCs provides the opportunity for centers to conduct fundamental research to better position themselves as leaders&nbsp;in emerging areas that could benefit the industries that they serve. Proposals must discuss how the proposed fundamental research will benefit potential and current industry members while charting a path for potentially new and emerging research directions.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>NSF supported Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers serve many industry research needs in areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Advanced electronics</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Advanced manufacturing</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Advanced Materials</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Biotechnology</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Civil Infrastructure Systems</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Information, communication, and computing</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Energy and environment</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Fabrication and process technology</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Health and Safety</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These investments contribute to advances that are important for the environment, energy, transportation, information technologies, health-related industries, the economy, and other areas that impact our daily lives and quality of life. </p>
<p>The I/UCRCs contribute to the knowledge base of a large number of industrial manufacturing processes that involve a wide range of technological pursuits and are found in areas such as aerospace, electronics, chemicals, recovery of natural resources, the environment, petroleum, biochemicals, materials, food, power generation, and allied activities.&nbsp; To better enable these processes, the I/UCRC fundamental research program&nbsp;supports research that involves the development of fundamental engineering and science principles, process control and optimization strategies, mathematical models, and experimental techniques, with an emphasis on projects that have the potential for innovation and broad application in areas in industry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This fundamental research is leading to applications that include sensors, materials, pharmaceuticals, imaging, visualization, embedded systems, next generation computers, medical devices and instrumentation, alternative energy,&nbsp;ecological engineering, water and waste treatment, and robotics.</p>
<p>Fundamental research proposals must be well planned with professional project management principles applied to help assure success.&nbsp;The proposal&nbsp;must include a&nbsp;project plan, schedule, milestones, budget, and other factors similar to the Project Proposal Form that the center should be using in its IAB meetings (Gray and Walters, <em>Managing the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center: A guide for Directors and Other Stakeholders</em>, p. 181, 1998).&nbsp; As such, the second page of the proposal&nbsp;must use the I/UCRC Project Proposal Form shown below to be considered as responsive to this solicitation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
</h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
</p>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the measurable industry collaboration (degree and extent to which industries appear to be involved with the proposed research). Proposals will be reviewed as to their industrial relevancy and to help guide program directors as to whether the proposed research could be accomplished without industry participation. Reviewers will also be asked if the proposed research extends the capabilities, scope, or project portfolio of the existing center.</p>
</p>
</ul>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review. </p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <br>
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
</p>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report&nbsp;will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
<p>The final report must discuss these sections for the report to be accepted:</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
