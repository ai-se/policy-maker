      href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 
      11-1</A>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals 
      submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that 
      the guidelines contained in <A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 
      11-1</A> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding 
      opportunity. Proposers who opt to submit prior to January 18, 2011, must 
      also follow the guidelines contained in <A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 
      11-1</A>.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Cost Sharing: </STRONG>The PAPPG has been revised to implement 
      the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing. 
      Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to 
      assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources necessary 
      for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other 
      Resources section of the proposal. The description should be narrative in 
      nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information. 
      Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by 
      the NSF Director. See the PAPP Guide Part I: <EM>Grant Proposal Guide

      recommendations.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Data Management Plan: </STRONG>The PAPPG contains a 
      clarification of NSF's long standing data policy. All proposals must 
      describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of 
      research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. FastLane will 
      not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management 
      Plan. The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the 
      intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as 
      appropriate. Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to 
      specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units 
      are available on the NSF website at: <A

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <DIV>
      <p>One nanometer (one billionth of a meter) is a magical point on the
      dimensional scale. Nanostructures are at the confluence of the smallest of 
      human-made devices and the largest molecules of living systems known 
      today. Nanoscale science and engineering here refer to the fundamental 
      understanding and resulting technological advances arising from the 
      exploitation of new physical, chemical, and biological properties of 
      systems that are intermediate in size, between isolated atoms and 
      molecules and bulk materials, where the transitional properties between 
      the two limits can be controlled. During the last few years, novel 
      structures, phenomena, and processes have been observed at the nanoscale 
      (from a fraction of a nanometer to about 100 nm) and new experimental, 
      theoretical, and simulation tools have been developed for investigating 
      them. These advances provide exciting opportunities for scientific and 
      technological developments in nanoparticles, nanostructure materials, 
      nanodevices, and systems.</p>
      <P>Nanotechnology is the creation and utilization of functional materials, 
      devices, and systems with novel properties and functions that are achieved 
      through the control and restructuring of matter at the atomic, molecular 
      and macromolecular levels. A revolution has begun in science, engineering, 
      and technology based on the ability to organize, characterize, and 
      manipulate matter systematically at the nanoscale. Far-reaching outcomes 
      for the 21st century are envisioned in both scientific knowledge and a 
      wide range of technologies in most industries, healthcare, conservation of 
      materials and energy, biology, environment, and education. Fundamental 
      research in nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) underpins innovation 
      in critical areas ranging from manufacturing to medicine.</P>
      <P>NSE has technological, economic, environmental, social, and ethical 
      dimensions that may change the world in which we live. Increased 
      understanding and appreciation of the potential for nanoscale science and 
      engineering will be needed to create an informed citizenry and a 
      competitive workforce.</P>
      <P>The Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program 
      aims to integrate nanoscale science, engineering, and technology into the 
      undergraduate engineering curricula. The NUE program provides funding for 
      projects that will address the educational challenges of these emerging 
      fields and generate practical ways of introducing nanotechnology into 
      undergraduate engineering education with a focus on devices and systems 
      and/or on social, economic, and ethical issues relevant to nanotechnology. 
      Given the worldwide expansion of research and education in nanoscale 
      science and engineering, international collaborations that advance 
      underlying nanoscale science and engineering education goals and 
      strengthen U.S. activities are encouraged.</P>
</DIV><A id=pgm_desc_txt name=pgm_desc_txt></A>
      <H3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</H3>
      <DIV>
      <P>
      <P>Program Goals</P>
      <P>Advances in nanotechnology research provide new opportunities in 
      undergraduate education. With their focus on imaging and manipulating the 
      atom, the ultimate building block of matter, nanoscale science and 
      engineering provide a multitude of new interdisciplinary teaching 
      opportunities for engaging interest and for broadening vision by students 
      of science, engineering, and technology. Nanoscale science and engineering 
      thus permit new strategies for enhancing science and engineering literacy, 
      preparing the workforce for emerging technologies, and attracting a 
      diverse group of talented students to the workforce of tomorrow. The FY 
      2011 solicitation is focused on nanoscale engineering education with 
      relevance to devices and systems, and/or on the societal, ethical, 
      economic and/or environmental&nbsp; issues relevant to nanotechnology.</P>
      <P>Nanoscale engineering provides creative opportunities for invigorating 
      undergraduate engineering education through new courses and research 
      experiences. It blends engineering, chemistry, physics, biology, 
      mathematics, computer science, materials science, geology, behavioral and 
      social sciences,&nbsp;and design.&nbsp; As such, it provides new 
      opportunities for faculty collaboration, both in teaching and in research, 
      that cross traditional disciplinary and departmental boundaries. Some 
      examples of nanotechnology-based topics that can be introduced into the 
      curriculum include scanning probe methods, devices using nanotubes, 
      bottom-up and top-down syntheses of nanoscale materials, self-assembly, 
      nanobiotechnology, environmental aspects of nanotechnology, applications 
      of nanotechnology to information technology, properties and fundamental 
      phenomena in nanoscale materials, computational methods for modeling 
      nanoscale materials, nanoscale devices, nanoscale systems, design 
      principles at nanoscale, and the societal, ethical, economic and 
      environmental implications of nanotechnology. See <A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/nano">https://www.nsf.gov/nano</A>&nbsp;for 
      additional examples.</P>
      <P>NUE in Engineering projects are intended to enable individuals, 
      departments, programs, or campuses to integrate nanoscale&nbsp; 
      engineering into their curricula. Integration could take the form of a new 
      course or courses, or modification of existing courses so that a 
      substantial portion of the course content is based on nanoscale 
      engineering. Integration could include a module or modules in courses that 
      focus on issues of environmental or social change and new developments in 
      nanoscale engineering, or a new course or series of courses that include 
      those focuses. Proposals involving any part of the undergraduate 
      engineering curriculum are eligible. International collaborations that 
      advance the underlying NUE in Engineering goals and strengthen U.S. 
      activities are encouraged.</P>
      <P>Project Characteristics</P>
      <P>NUE in Engineering&nbsp;emphasizes new approaches to undergraduate 
      engineering education through interdisciplinary collaborations. These 
      collaborations could lead to, but are not limited to:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>A freshman course introducing the basic phenomena and processes at 
        the nanoscale, the unifying principle of matter at the nanoscale, 
        connections to other disciplines, and application areas of societal 
        relevance;
        <LI>New examples of undergraduate nanoscale engineering courses that are 
        presented through the development of laboratory and demonstration

                <li><p>Goals and Objectives. The goals of the project should be stated
                      clearly and concisely in relation to the goals of the NUE component.</p></li>
                <li><p>Results of Prior NUE Support. In addition to results of prior
                      support as required by the GPG or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide,
                      institutions participating in prior NUE awards must describe the
                      relationship of that award to this new proposal.</p></li>
                <li><p>Detailed Project Plan. The project plan should be the longest
                      section of the Project Description. It should include description of the
                      project's features, clearly delineating the plan to introduce or enhance
                      nanotechnology in the undergraduate curriculum and its relevance to
                      engineering education. The plan should include:</p>
                    <p>Background on the proposed project describing how it builds on nanoscale and pedagogical research;</p>

                      disseminated (e.g., computer presentations, laboratory manuals, software,
                      multimedia materials); how the material will be made available to other
                      institutions; the means of dissemination (e.g., faculty development
                      workshops, journal articles, conference presentations, electronic
                      networks, media); and the procedures for determining the success of the
                      dissemination effort. Describe procedures to be used to maintain the
                      quality and currency of any material developed, to provide support for
                      faculty users, and to publicize the availability of materials.</p>

      <H3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW 
      PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</H3>
      <P>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program 
      where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation 
      requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, 
      engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by 
      three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular 
      fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by 
      Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. 
      Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are 
      especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would 
      prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source 
      in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. 
      Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure 
      that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the 
      proposal.</P>
      

      <h4 id="reviewcrit">A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4>

      <P>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science 
      Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the 
      broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF 
      will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific 
      objectives of certain programs and activities.</P>
      <P>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The 
      criteria include considerations that help define them. These 
      considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given 
      proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, 
      reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are 
      relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is 
      qualified to make judgements.</P>
      <P style="margin-left: 40px;"><STRONG>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed
      activity?</STRONG><BR>How important is the proposed activity to advancing 
      knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different 
      fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct 
      the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of 
      the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and 
      explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How 
      well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient 
      access to resources?</P>
      <P style="margin-left: 40px;"><STRONG>What are the broader impacts of the proposed
      activity?</STRONG><BR>How well does the activity advance discovery and 
      understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well 
      does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented 
      groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what 
      extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such 
      as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the 
      results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological 
      understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to 
      society? </P>
      <DIV>
      <P>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts 
      are available electronically on the NSF website at: <A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</A>.</P>
      <P>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on 
      the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be 
      evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</P></DIV>
      <P>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in 
      making funding decisions:</P>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><EM><STRONG>Integration of Research and
      Education</STRONG></EM><BR>One of the principal strategies in support of 
      NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the 
      programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research 
      institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where 
      individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, 
      educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that 
      infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research 
      through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
      <P style="margin-left: 40px;"><EM><STRONG>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and
      Activities</STRONG></EM><BR>Broadening opportunities and enabling the 
      participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented 
      minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health

      <H4>B. Review and Selection Process</H4>
      <P>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be 
      reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review. </P>
<P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support 
      or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the 
      proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate 
      a recommendation.</P>
<P>
<P>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration 
      of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the 
      cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or 
      recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants 
      whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding 
      within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target 
      date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when 
      the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and 
      submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as 
      confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of 
      the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by 
      the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an 
      explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</P>
<P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the 
  proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of 
  Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy 
  implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other 
  agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements 
  Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or 
  authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF 
  should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF 
  Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes 
  financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or 
  cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does 
  so at their own risk.</P>

      <H4>A. Notification of the Award</H4>
      <P>
      <P>Notification of the award is made to<EM> the submitting 
      organization</EM> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and 
      Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as 
      promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the 
      program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the 
      reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. 
      (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</P>

      <H4>B. Award Conditions</H4>
      <P>
      <P>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any 
      special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments 
      thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of 
      expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any 
      specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the 
      proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award 
      conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms 
      and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may 
      be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements 
      also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement 
      Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the 
      applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are 
      electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and 
      transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</P>
      <P>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <A

<A id=reportreq name=reportreq></A>
      <H4>C. Reporting Requirements</H4>
      <P>
      <P>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing 
      grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report 
      to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the 
      current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent 
      project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also 
      is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes 
      report for the general public.</P>
      <P>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the 
      project outcomes report&nbsp;will delay NSF review and processing of any 
      future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. 
      PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to 
      assure availability of required data.</P>
      <P>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, 
      available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and 
      final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on 
      activities and findings, project participants (individual and 
      organizational) publications; and, other specific products and 
      contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information 
      previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using 
      the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane 
      constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are 
      accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and 
      submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, 
      prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the 
      project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is 
      submitted by the PI.</P>

      <H3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</H3>
      <P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency 
      created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 
      1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the 
      progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and 
      welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and 
      engineering."</P>
      <P>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and 
      engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to 
      more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, 
      informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout 
      the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to 
      academic institutions for basic research.</P>
      <P>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, 
      education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. 
      In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for 
      graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories 
      itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, 
      certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The 
      Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and 
      industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering 
      efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</P>
      <P><EM>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with 
      Disabilities</EM> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to 
      enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See 
      Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding 
      preparation of these types of proposals.</P>
      <P>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf 
      (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that 
      enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the 
      Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may 
      be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800)
