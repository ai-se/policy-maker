          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program seeks to encourage talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors (STEM) and professionals to become K-12 STEM teachers. This program responds to the critical need for highly effective K-12 STEM teachers by recruiting and preparing talented undergraduate STEM majors and STEM professionals to pursue teaching careers in elementary and secondary schools, especially in high-need local educational agencies. The program seeks to encourage institutions of higher education to develop and sustain a culture where undergraduate STEM majors, especially those of the highest achievement and ability, are encouraged and supported when they express a desire to pursue K-12 STEM teaching careers.</p>
          <p>The program was first authorized under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-368). It was reauthorized in 2007 under the America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), and amended by the STEM Education Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-59). The Noyce program addresses the goal established by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, "of ensuring over the next decade the recruitment, preparation, and induction support of at least 100,000 new STEM middle and high school teachers who have strong majors in STEM fields and strong content-specific pedagogical preparation, by providing vigorous support for programs designed to produce such teachers."(PCAST, 2010). By supporting the recruitment and preparation of strong STEM teachers who will teach in high-need local educational agencies, serving diverse student populations, the program supports the strategic objective (G1/O2) in the <em>NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018:</em> "Integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities." The Noyce Program supports the role of NSF as central to discovering, studying, and promoting pathways for STEM teacher education through research and development.</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The <strong>Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program</strong> consists of four tracks: <strong>Track 1</strong> - The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarships and Stipends Track (S&amp;S), <strong>Track 2</strong> - The NSF Teaching Fellowships Track (TF), <strong>Track 3</strong> - The NSF Master Teaching Fellowships Track (MTF), and <strong>Track 4</strong> - Noyce Research Track. In addition, funds for <strong>Capacity Building </strong>awards, which may lead to the development of full proposals in Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, or Track 3: MTF, are also supported. Partnerships between four-year institutions and two-year institutions, providing pathways leading to STEM teacher certification, are particularly encouraged. Conferences and workshops consistent with the mission of the intent of the Noyce program are also supported in accordance with the most recent published NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG).</p>

          <p><strong>Funding for Previously Funded </strong><strong>Noyce Grantee Institutions</strong> </p>
          <p>NSF welcomes proposals from previously funded Noyce grantee institutions in any track. However, in a detailed description of the previously funded work, the proposers must provide strong evidence of the success of, and what was learned from, the previous Noyce award(s) and/or project challenges and how the new project will be able to overcome them. The proposed new Noyce project must also present data to demonstrate the workforce need in high-need local educational agencies and the capacity to recruit candidates, as well as provide a plan for following Noyce recipients longitudinally. Previous grantees must detail what new may be learned from the proposed project, including how this information may inform further improvement in STEM teacher preparation. These proposals must include plans for monitoring (including tracking) and evaluation of new cohorts. Proposals must include plans for evaluating the impact of the program on recruitment and retention of STEM teachers, the impact on the institution(s) of higher education (IHE), and the effectiveness of the Noyce scholarship/stipend recipients as K-12 STEM teachers.</p>
          <p><strong>Capacity Building</strong> <strong>Proposals</strong></p>
          <p>Funds for Capacity Building awards, which may lead to the development of full proposals in Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, or Track 3: MTF, are supported. These funds are for institutions to develop evidence-based innovative models and strategies for recruiting, preparing, and supporting teachers and to establish the infrastructure for implementing a future Noyce project. Examples of possible project activities include, but are not limited to: conducting needs assessments to determine areas of teacher shortages and interest among STEM professionals; strengthening partnerships with high-need local educational agencies; strengthening collaborations among faculty in STEM departments and faculty in education; strengthening collaborations among institutions of higher education, including two-year colleges; designing/developing new courses as well as early field experiences, new degree requirements, and/or programs to support new teachers. Activities related to TF or MTF Capacity Building projects may also include the identification of matching funds and securing agreements with high-need local educational agencies regarding salary supplements. Collaborations between currently funded successful Noyce projects and institutions seeking to develop capacity for recruiting and preparing STEM teachers (S&amp;S), Teaching Fellows, or Master Teaching Fellows are encouraged. Capacity Building projects do not award scholarships, stipends, fellowships, or internships.</p>

          <p><strong>Institutional and Recipient Obligations for Projects (not including Capacity Building) in Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, or Track 3: MTF</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>Institution</em></strong>: A grantee receiving a grant under Track 1, 2, or 3 (S&amp;S, TF, or MTF, not including Capacity Building projects) of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program agrees to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>ensure that scholarship/stipend/fellowship recipients accept the terms of the scholarship/stipend/fellowship and that the recipients provide annual certification of employment and current contact information;</li>
            <li>supply relevant statistical and demographic data on recipients as requested, including information on employment required under the track; and</li>
            <li>monitor (including tracking) and report on the compliance of scholarship/stipend/fellowship recipients with their teaching service commitments. In the event that a recipient is required to repay the scholarship/stipend/fellowship, the institution (the grantee) will:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>be responsible for determining the repayment amounts and for notifying the recipient and providing documentation in project reports; and</li>
                <li>collect such repayment amount, including interest, as determined by the repayment policy developed by the institution and agreed upon by the recipient. The institution (the grantee) may retain up to 5 percent of any repayment collected to defray administrative costs associated with the collection.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The grantee is responsible for reporting the aforementioned information annually to the National Science Foundation directly and/or to a designated third party. In some cases, the grantee responsibility to report may extend for up to 12 years following the end date of the award and submission of the final project report.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Recipient</em></strong>: As a condition of acceptance of a scholarship/stipend/fellowship, the recipient agrees to provide the institution with annual certification of employment and up-to-date contact information as well as to participate in activities (e.g., surveys) conducted as part of institution project-level and NSF program-level evaluation. In addition, the scholarship/stipend/fellowship may revert to a loan, meaning that the recipient will be required to repay all or a portion of the scholarship/stipend/fellowship, if the recipient:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>fails to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing in the program in which the individual is enrolled;</li>
            <li>is dismissed from the program or institution for disciplinary reasons;</li>
            <li>withdraws from the program before the completion of such program;</li>
            <li>declares that the individual does not intend to fulfill the teaching service commitment; or</li>
            <li>fails to fulfill the teaching service commitment.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If such circumstances occur before the completion of one year of the teaching service commitment under any track, the total amount of scholarship or stipend received by the individual must be repaid. If the circumstance described occurs after the completion of one year of the teaching service commitment, the amount to be repaid will be as follows:</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Track 1 &ndash; S&amp;S:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>For a scholarship recipient, a proportion of the total scholarship awards received by the individual, prorated appropriately to reflect partial service completed; or</li>
            <li>For a stipend recipient, one-half of the total amount of stipend received by the individual.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Track 2 &ndash; TF:</strong> the full amount of the fellowship awarded during enrollment in the master&rsquo;s degree program, reduced by one-fourth for each year of service completed plus one half of the total salary supplements received.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Track 3 &ndash; MTF: </strong>one-half of the total amount of salary supplements received.</p>
          <p>For <strong>Tracks 1, 2, and 3</strong>, any such repayment will be returned to the Federal Government (the Treasury of the United States), consistent with the provisions of part B or D of Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These funds may not be re-used by the awardee institution.</p>
          <p>The institution is expected to establish procedures that ensure compliance with the teaching service requirement, with allowances for extreme hardship or other circumstances for which it is not in the best interests of the school district or not feasible for the scholarship, stipend, or fellowship recipient to fulfill the teaching service commitment. The institution may establish procedures for waiving or suspending repayment of scholarships/stipends/fellowships in cases of extreme hardship or other circumstances that would preclude the fulfillment of the teaching service commitment.</p>
          <p><strong>Track 4: Noyce Research Track</strong></p>
          <p>The Noyce Research Track of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program offers awards to institutions, professional societies, and similar organizations that are directly associated with educational or research activities, to support planning, exploratory research, and research proposals that address the issue of STEM teacher effectiveness, persistence, or retention in high-need local educational agencies.</p>
          <p>The Noyce Research Track is interested in research studies related to teacher effectiveness and persistence, as well as teacher retention by high-need local educational agencies. The program will support proposals that investigate effectiveness and/or persistence of STEM teachers in high-need local educational agencies. Such studies might examine the teacher candidate characteristics and/or programmatic features that are shown to result in highly effective teachers who persist in teaching in high-need local educational agencies. Studies on persistence of Noyce scholarship, stipend, or fellowship recipients as teachers in high-need school districts beyond their service requirement are strongly encouraged. Studies that identify characteristics of high-need schools or districts that result in retention of STEM teachers are welcome.</p>
          <p>Research studies may range from research synthesis to experimental investigations in order to show relationships between teacher preparation and learning (National Research Council report, <em>Preparing Teachers: Building Evidence for Sound Policy</em>, 2010, p. 6).</p>
          <p>Noyce Research Track projects must include substantive collaboration among STEM faculty, STEM education faculty, and researchers in education (and/or the social, behavioral, and economic sciences). Proposals must include the theory which underlies the research design and provide appropriate methodologies and strategies and are expected to contribute to the knowledge base of scholarly research in STEM education. Studies that involve examination of only a single institution&rsquo;s teacher preparation program are discouraged unless the proposal provides a compelling argument that the results can be generalized to the larger community.</p>
          <p>Track 4 proposals are encouraged to be informed by the <em>Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development </em>as well as basic tenets of Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR).</p>

          <li>Proposals in Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, and Track 3: MTF are expected to include the items listed below in Section V.A.3.a.i &ndash; V.A.3.a.xiii, not necessarily in the order presented, but clearly identified. In addition, proposals should include evidence that the institution is committed to making the program a central institutional focus. In the Project Description, proposals must describe:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>The number and size of scholarships, internships, and stipends (for S&amp;S) or fellowships (for TF and MTF); the rationale for the number and size of scholarships and/or stipends (for S&amp;S) or fellowships (for TF and MTF); and projected cumulative number of new STEM teachers (for S&amp;S and TF) or NSF Master Teaching Fellows (for MTF) to be produced over the duration of the program with a comparison to number of STEM teachers or master teachers currently produced by the proposing institution(s).</li>
              <li>The teacher preparation program (for S&amp;S), master's degree program which allows an individual to obtain certification or licensing within one year (for TF), master&rsquo;s degree program and leadership training to prepare exemplary and experienced teachers with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree to become master teachers (for MTF), or professional development program for exemplary and experienced teachers with a master&rsquo;s degree to become master teachers (for MTF). This description should include the academic requirements and other components of the program in which the scholarship/stipend or fellowship recipients will participate, the extent to which the proposed strategies reflect effective practices based on research, and any modifications or course revisions that will be developed and implemented. For proposals involving more than one institution, the proposal should describe the program at each participating institution and the roles and responsibilities of each institution in the project.</li>
              <li>The recruitment activities and specific marketing strategies designed to attract a large and diverse pool of applicants, with special attention to undergraduate STEM majors who might not otherwise have considered a career as a K-12 STEM teacher. These plans must include evidence of ability to recruit the proposed number of program participants from the available pool of potential applicants, including (a) baseline data in regard to STEM majors and institutional STEM teacher production and (b) justification of the workforce need in the area.</li>
              <li>The selection process that will ensure that the most qualified applicants are selected based on academic merit, with consideration given to financial need and increasing participation of minorities, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented genders relative to specific teaching areas.</li>

              <li>A genuine collaboration between faculty in STEM departments and education faculty.</li>
              <li>An infrastructure that will be supportive of new teachers, especially during their induction years.</li>
              <li>Activities and support mechanisms that will be available to Noyce recipients to ensure that they become highly effective STEM teachers in high-need local educational agencies and are able to fulfill their teaching service commitment.</li>
              <li>Plans to monitor and enforce compliance with the teaching service commitment. These plans must include mechanisms for tracking the recipients during the period in which they are fulfilling their teaching service commitment and a plan for collecting demographic data and statistics on recipients.</li>
              <li>An evaluation plan that will assess the effectiveness of the project in attracting, preparing, and retaining STEM majors and/or STEM professionals in teaching careers (for S&amp;S and TF) or developing and retaining Master Teaching Fellows in teaching careers (for MTF) in high-need local educational agencies. The plan should include ways to measure the effectiveness of the recipients as teachers and teacher leaders. The proposal must identify an independent evaluator with the expertise to conduct an objective evaluation.</li>
              <li>Plans for disseminating the results of the project and for contributing to the knowledge base about teacher preparation, recruitment, and retention, especially in high-need local educational agencies.</li>
              <li>Cost sharing (for Track 2: TF and Track 3: MTF only), including source and amount.</li>

        <h4> 
         B. Budgetary Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
        
      <p>Cost sharing is required.</p>
        <p>Cost sharing is required <strong>only</strong> for Track 2: TF and Track 3: MTF projects. Cost sharing is neither required nor allowed for Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 4: Noyce Research, or Capacity Building projects and therefore should not be included in the proposal. </p>
        <p>For Track 2: TF and Track 3: MTF proposals requesting less than $1.5 million, cost sharing of at least 30% of the amount of the grant request is required, at least half of which must be in cash. Proposals requesting $1.5 million or more must provide matching funds of at least 50% of the amount of the request, at least half of which must be cash. For Track 2: TF and Track 3: MTF proposals associated with partnerships between two-year institutions and four-year institutions (including doctorate, masters, and baccalaureate granting), the Director has waived the cost sharing requirement for the additional $250,000 funds.</p>
        <p>The proposed cost sharing must be shown on Line M on the proposal budget. For purposes of budget preparation, the cumulative cost sharing amount must be entered on Line M of the first year&rsquo;s budget.  Should an award be made, the organization&rsquo;s cost sharing commitment, as specified on the first year&rsquo;s approved budget, must be met prior to award expiration.</p>
        <p>Such cost sharing will be an eligibility, rather than a review criterion.  Proposers are advised not to exceed the mandatory cost sharing level or amount specified in the solicitation.</p>
        <p>When mandatory cost sharing is included on Line M, and accepted by the Foundation, the commitment of funds becomes legally binding and is subject to audit.  When applicable, the estimated value of any in-kind contributions also should be included on Line M.  An explanation of the source, nature, amount and availability of any proposed cost sharing must be provided in the budget justification.  Contributions may be made from any non-Federal source, including non-Federal grants or contracts, and may be cash or in-kind. 2 CFR &sect; 200.306 describes criteria and procedures for the allowability of cash and in-kind contributions in satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements. It should be noted that contributions derived from other Federal funds or counted as cost sharing toward projects of another Federal agency must not be counted towards meeting the specific cost sharing requirements of the NSF award.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the level of cost sharing required by the NSF solicitation and reflected in the NSF award budget may result in termination of the NSF award, disallowance of award costs and/or refund of award funds to NSF by the awardee.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>For Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, and Track 3: MTF proposals, at least 60% of the proposed total Direct Costs (budget line H.) must be allocated for support directly received by the participants in the form of scholarship, stipends, or salary supplements as reported on budget line <em>F.1. STIPENDS</em> in FastLane (or Section E.2. on the Grants.gov R&amp;R Budget Form). Funds requested specifically for other types of scholarship/stipend/fellowship recipient support, such as travel, internships or materials, should be entered in section <em>F. Participant Support Costs</em>, on lines 2., 3., or 4. in FastLane (or Sections E.3., 4., or 5. on the Grants.gov R&amp;R Budget Form) as appropriate, but are not included in the 60%. This limitation does not apply to Capacity Building or Noyce Research proposals.</p>
   
        <p><strong>Budget Preparation Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p>Scholarships, stipends, and fellowships should be indicated on budget line <em>F.1. STIPENDS</em> in FastLane (or Section E.2. on the Grants.gov R&amp;R Budget Form). Enter the number of participants supported in each budget year in section F of the budget form in FastLane (or Section E. on the Grants.gov R&amp;R Budget Form).</p>
        <p>Funds should also be included for the PI or another member of the leadership team and one current or former Noyce Scholar, NSF Teaching Fellow, or NSF Master Teaching Fellow to attend meetings of grantees and other researchers that may be organized by community stakeholders such as professional societies or other scholarly interest groups.</p>
        <p>The budget justification for a proposal submitted under Track 2: TF or Track 3: MTF should clearly identify the source and nature of matching funds. Proposals in these tracks being submitted through Grants.gov should enter the cost share amount on line <em>15.b. Total Non-Federal Funds</em> on the SF 424 (R&amp;R) form, which will then be entered on Line M of the NSF budget when the proposal is transferred to the NSF FastLane System. In addition, proposals in Track 2: TF or Track 3: MTF requesting a six-year budget to support two cohorts of fellows will need to be submitted through FastLane because Grants.gov will not accommodate a six-year budget.</p>

    <h3>
         VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
  
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
 <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>In addition to the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact criteria, for proposals in Track 1: S&amp;S, Track 2: TF, and Track 3: MTF, reviewers will be asked to consider the evidence of the following central issues (including results of prior Noyce awards, if applicable):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The extent to which the proposed work attends to the expectations and requirements discussed in <em>Section II. Program Description</em> <em>and Section V. Project Description </em>relevant to the track to which the proposal is being submitted.</li>
          <li>The potential of the project to recruit, prepare, and retain STEM majors and/or STEM professionals (for S&amp;S and TF Tracks) or develop and retain Master Teaching Fellows (for MTF Track), in teaching careers in high-need local educational agencies.</li>
          <li>The quality of the academic requirements and other components of the program, the extent to which the proposed preparation, recruitment, and retention strategies reflect effective practices based on research.</li>
          <li>That the institution is committed to sustaining the program beyond the period of NSF funding (with the possible exception of funds for scholarships/stipends/fellowships).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For <strong>Track 4: Noyce Research</strong>, in addition to the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria, reviewers will be asked to consider the evidence of the following central issue (including results of prior Noyce awards, if applicable):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The extent to which the proposed work attends to the expectations and requirements discussed in <em>Section II. Program Description</em> <em>and Section V. Project Description</em> relevant to this track as regards teacher effectiveness, persistence, or retention in teaching in high-need school districts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
         <h4>
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>All projects will be required to participate in program monitoring (including tracking) and evaluation activities conducted by a third party as part of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources program evaluation efforts that will require annual data collection.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
