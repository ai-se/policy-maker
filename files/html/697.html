<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) invites investigators at U.S. organizations to
submit proposals for projects that will contribute to the further development of the Arctic
Observing Network (AON) and enable the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). Compared with
much of the rest of the Earth, the Arctic is a data-sparse region where large, rapid and system-wide
environmental change is occurring. The goal of AON is to enhance the environmental observing
infrastructure required for the scientific investigation of Arctic environmental change and its
global connections.</p>

<p>This solicitation invites proposals for the following activities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p>continuation of existing NSF-supported AON projects;</p></li>
<li><p>the initiation of new AON projects; and </p></li>
<li><p>projects that address environmental observing system coverage, design and optimization. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>AON encompasses physical, biological and human observations, including indigenous knowledge, of
the land, ocean and atmosphere (to a maximum altitude of ~90 km, i.e., the top of the mesosphere).
Proposals must include a scientific rationale that includes an explanation as to why the proposed
activity, data (including frequency and duration of observations) and geographic location are
essential to research that will advance the understanding of Arctic environmental change. Proposals
for the research, e.g., data analysis, data synthesis, process studies and computer modeling, that
will lead to understanding of Arctic environmental change will not be considered.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Division of Arctic Sciences in the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) invests in scientific
research about the arctic region and related research and operational support. Science programs are
suitable for disciplinary, multidisciplinary and broad, interdisciplinary investigations directed
toward both the Arctic as a region of special scientific interest and a region important to
the global system. Models indicate that the Arctic is among the regions most sensitive to
environmental change. Climate records and human settlement spanning thousands of years, as well as
vast landscapes and partially ice-covered oceans, provide a unique basis for integrated research on
global systems and human adaptation.</p>
<p>OPP disciplinary interests appropriate to the Arctic Natural Sciences program encompass the
atmospheric, biological, cryospheric, earth, and ocean sciences. A broad spectrum of social sciences
research is funded through the Arctic Social Sciences program. The Arctic System Science program
provides the unique opportunity for interdisciplinary investigations of the Arctic as a system. OPP
also encourages research relevant to both polar regions, especially glaciology, permafrost, sea ice,
oceanography, and ecology. The Arctic Observing Network program supports the design and
implementation of a broad network of long-term observations of the Arctic useful to a wide segment
of the arctic community. The integration of research with education is consistent with
NSF&rsquo;s merit review criteria and is encouraged by OPP in proposals to the research programs.
Proposals may seek funding for pilot projects linking research with education through the
Arctic Research and Education program. Arctic research projects that partner with schools,
students (K-12 and higher), and communities in the North and that improve the public&rsquo;s
understanding of science and basic research are strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>The Foundation is one of 12 Federal agencies that sponsor or conduct arctic science, engineering,
and related activities. As mandated by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, Federal
interagency research planning is coordinated through the Interagency Arctic Research Policy
Committee (IARPC), which is chaired by NSF.</p>
<p>The United States Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 defines the Arctic as all areas north of
the Arctic Circle and all United States territory north and west of the boundary formed by the
Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; all contiguous seas including the Arctic Ocean and the
Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi seas; and the Aleutian chain. Field projects falling outside these
boundaries but directly related to arctic science and engineering conditions, or issues, such as
laboratory and theoretical studies, may also be appropriate; OPP recommends contacting the program
director to verify the appropriateness of the proposed study before preparing a proposal.</p>
<p>Because the Arctic is the homeland of numerous Native peoples, special attention must be given to
all aspects of research and education that may potentially impact their lives. An interagency
statement of &rdquo;Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic&rdquo; has been developed.
All arctic research grantees are expected to abide by these principles, which can be found at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp</a>.
Researchers may find helpful information in the &rdquo;Guidelines for Improved Cooperation between
Arctic Researchers and Northern Communities&rdquo; at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/guidelines">http://www.arcus.org/guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The Study of Environmental ARctic CHange (SEARCH) is an interagency effort to study changes
occurring in the arctic system (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/SEARCH/index.php">http://www.arcus.org/SEARCH/index.php</a>).
NSF is among the agencies contributing to this effort, which is also gaining support as a major
international effort as the International Study of Arctic Change (ISAC). SEARCH themes supported by
the Arctic Sciences Division will be guided by the research community through avenues such as the
SEARCH Science Steering Committee, the SEARCH Open Science Meeting and the SEARCH Implementation
Workshop held in May 2005. The Division of Arctic Sciences has funded components of SEARCH research
through special announcements of opportunity and expects to continue supporting the development of
SEARCH through special announcements and through this program solicitation, depending on the
availability of funds.</p>

<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>NSF has been supporting science-driven Arctic environmental observing projects since 1999. The
scope of NSF-supported Arctic environmental observing activities subsequently increased as a result
of its International Polar Year (IPY) competitions to begin the development and deployment of a
science-driven Arctic Observing Network (AON) that enables research into Arctic environmental
change, i.e., the &lsquo;Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH)&rsquo;. In April 2007, the
U.S. Inter-Agency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) charged the IARPC staff with the
development of AON as part of the implementation of SEARCH and as a lasting legacy of IPY. This
solicitation represents a further NSF contribution to the development of AON and implementation of
SEARCH during IPY and beyond.</p>
<p>The Arctic environment is changing. The changes are large, rapid and system-wide. They have few
equals elsewhere on Earth, and some are occurring at greater rates than predicted by computer
models. Arctic environmental change has regional and global implications, and continued changes will
have significant Arctic and worldwide environmental and societal consequences.</p>
<p>Nothing illustrates the scale of Arctic environmental change, and the sensitivity of the Arctic
environment and its global importance, better than the dramatic and unforeseen recession of the
Arctic sea ice cover in summer 2007. That the rate of sea ice change far exceeded computer model
results also exemplifies the uncertainties inherent in predictions of Arctic system change, and the
need to identify the source of those uncertainties. Large changes such as the summer 2007 sea ice
minimum and what it reveals about system-wide uncertainty and predictive capability underscore the
need for continued and greater vigilance via enhanced environmental observing infrastructure that is
coordinated, integrated and sustained.</p>
<p>The magnitude and rate of the system-wide environmental changes in the Arctic are such that there
is broad consensus that enhanced Arctic environmental observing capabilities are critically
important - see, for example, <em>The Scope of Science for the International Polar Year 2007-2008
</em>by the IPY Joint Committee.
Current environmental observing capabilities are not adequate to support the research, e.g., data
analysis, data synthesis, process studies, and computer modeling, that is essential for better
understanding of the regional and global causes and consequences of Arctic environmental change.
Without improved environmental observing capabilities and understanding of Arctic environmental
change, regional and global society&rsquo;s ability to anticipate, predict and develop effective
adaptive responses to future environmental changes will be severely limited.</p>
<p>This solicitation invites proposals for the following activities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p>continuation of existing NSF-supported AON projects;</p></li>
<li><p>the initiation of new AON projects; and</p></li>
<li><p>projects that address environmental observing system coverage, design and optimization.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>AON encompasses physical, biological and human observations, including indigenous knowledge, of
the land, ocean and atmosphere (to a maximum altitude of ~90 km, i.e., the top of the mesosphere).
Proposals must include a scientific rationale as to why the proposed activity, data (including
frequency and duration of observations) and geographic location are essential to research that will
advance the understanding of Arctic environmental change.</p>
<p>AON is a major part of the SEARCH Observing Change component, and it can not develop in isolation
from the other components of SEARCH, i.e., Understanding Change and Responding to Change. At the
current stage of SEARCH implementation, connections among Observing Change and Understanding Change
projects and activities are particularly important. While this solicitation will not consider
proposals for research, e.g., data analysis, data synthesis, process studies and computer modeling,
that will lead to understanding of Arctic environmental change, observing proposals should be
informed by current understanding of Arctic environmental change, and describe how the project will
contribute to future Understanding Change research projects and activities.</p>
<p>Proposers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with SEARCH reports (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/search/index.php">http://www.arcus.org/search/index.php</a>)
and consider the scientific questions and priorities presented in the SEARCH Implementation Plan.
Other useful documents include the US National Academies report <em>Toward an Integrated Arctic
Observing Network</em> (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11607">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11607</a>),
the IARPC report <em>Arctic Observing Network (AON): Toward a U.S. Contribution to Pan-Arctic
Observing</em> (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf0842/index.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf0842/index.jsp</a>),
and and the <em>Arctic Observation Integration Workshops Report</em> (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/search/meetings/2008/aow/report.php">http://www.arcus.org/search/meetings/2008/aow/report.php</a>).</p>
<p>All funded projects must conform to the SEARCH data policy (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/search/downloads/SEARCH_DataPolicy_051207.pdf">http://www.arcus.org/search/downloads/SEARCH_DataPolicy_051207.pdf</a>).
Briefly, the SEARCH data policy requires (1) project data to be fully, freely, and openly available
as quickly as possible after collection and quality control, and (2) data, metadata and
documentation to be submitted to an appropriate national archive or repository. The only
exceptions to this policy are some instances with human-dimensions data, where respect for
confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or proprietary information sources might take
precedence. Exceptions can also be made in cases where data release might cause harm.</p>
<p>AON data are considered to be community data and not subject to embargo periods. Proposals must
include a data and information management plan that describes how full, free, open and immediate
access to data and information by all researchers and others will be achieved during the course of
the award, e.g., via a project Web site. Proposers should be aware that posting graphs on a Web site
is not sufficient; original data and documentation must be made available. The data and information
management plan must also include transfer of all data to a recognized data repository by the
conclusion of the award. Proposals should include a letter from the repository describing its
commitment to receive, archive and distribute the data. Proposers should budget for the costs
(typically 10% of the total request) associated with data and information management, including
preparation of data sets for submission to the repository and any repository charges.</p>
<p>NSF is currently supporting the development of the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information
Service (CADIS: <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/">http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/</a>)
for AON data and information management. At a minimum, all projects must provide metadata to CADIS,
but proposers are encouraged to take advantage of CADIS to meet all their data and information
management needs. Proposers should discuss their data and information management needs with CADIS
personnel. Information about current NSF-supported AON projects is also available at the CADIS Web
site.</p>
<p>All proposals must include a plan for coordination and integration of the observing activity with
other Arctic environmental observing activities. Proposals should demonstrate how the proposed
activity will have a greater impact through coordination and integration with other projects and
programs. Documentation of this impact would include letters from collaborators that demonstrate
their commitment to coordination and integration of observing activities, and sharing of
resources.</p>
<p>All proposals must include a description of how coordination and integration (e.g., sharing data,
information, equipment and logistics; attendance at annual AON PI meetings) with other NSF-supported
Arctic observing projects will be achieved. Proposers will find information on the other NSF-funded
AON projects at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/projects/">http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/projects/</a>.
Proposers should also consider coordination and integration with other Federal agencies, observing
projects in other countries, and projects coordinated internationally. Proposers will find
information about the Arctic observing activities of other Federal agencies in the IARPC report
<em>&lsquo;Arctic Observing Network (AON): Toward a U.S. Contribution to Pan-Arctic
Observing&rsquo;</em> (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf0842/index.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf0842/index.jsp</a>).</p>
<p>Proposals for the continuation of existing NSF-supported Arctic environmental observing projects
must include the following information: (1) evidence that data and information have been deposited
at a recognized data archive/repository, where full, free, open and immediate access is possible for
all researchers and others; (2) evidence that, during the course of the project, data and
information have been fully, freely, openly and immediately accessible to all researchers and
others, (3) evidence that the data have been used by other researchers, and have contributed to new
scientific knowledge and understanding of Arctic environmental system change; (4) a scientific
rationale for why the observations should be continued; and (5) why NSF should support continued
observations.</p>
<p>Proposals for new Arctic environmental observing projects should also explain why NSF is the
appropriate agency to support the proposed observations. With the exception of proposals for AON
coverage, design and optimization, all proposals should address the long-term sustainability of the
proposed observing activity. NSF does not provide indefinite support, and all proposers should
consider how many years of data are required to meet the needs of the data analysis, data synthesis,
process studies and computer modeling that would contribute to the Understanding Change component of
SEARCH. All proposals should also address the potential for transfer of responsibility to an
operational agency, and, where appropriate, include a transition plan and letter of interest from an
agency that that would assume responsibility for the observations.</p>
<p>The implementation of AON in the years beyond IPY will benefit from formal analysis of observing
system coverage, and design and optimization studies. Proposals addressing coverage, design
and optimization should be informed by Chapter 6 in the US National Academies report
<em>&lsquo;Toward an Integrated Arctic Observing Network&rsquo;</em> (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11607">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11607</a>).
Proposers should also consider previous and current NSF investments in Arctic observing (for more
information go to <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/projects/">http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/aon-cadis/projects/</a>)
and have the flexibility and adaptability to take into account the observing projects that will be
funded via this solicitation. The Arctic observing activities of other Federal agencies (e.g., the
IARPC AON report <em>&lsquo;Arctic Observing Network: Toward a U.S. Contribution to Pan-Arctic
Observing&rsquo;</em>, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/arctrsch/start.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/arctrsch/start.jsp</a>)
and international projects and programs should also be taken into account. Proposals for analysis of
observing system coverage, and design and optimization studies must also include a plan for making
the results fully, freely and openly available in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that many projects will require field support. For proper review of proposals
and to initiate logistics planning and budgeting, the Project Description must include a section
that describes the scope of fieldwork, including location, schedule, major equipment, number of
people, maps and figures. It is anticipated that many projects will require the services of a
third-party field support provider such as CH2M Hill Polar Services (CPS) or the Barrow Arctic
Science Consortium (BASC). Proposers planning to use a third-party provider must contact them for an
itemized estimate that will be included in the proposal in <strong>Special Information and
Supplementary Information</strong>. Alternatively, proposers can organize their own logistics, and
include field support costs in the grant budget request along with a comprehensive justification and
rationale. For more information on field support planning, see <strong>Proposals Involving Arctic
Field Work</strong> in Section V.A.</p>
<p>Proposers should consult the full text of this solicitation for further information on proposal
preparation, fieldwork, data management, review criteria, award conditions and other pertinent
information.</p>

<p><strong>Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic<br /></strong>Researchers should
conform to the <em>Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic</em>, prepared by the Social
Science Task Force of the U.S. Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) and approved by
IARPC in 1990. These principles apply to all researchers and are listed at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp</a>.
Proposers may also find the &ldquo;Guidelines for Improved Cooperation between Northern Communities
and Arctic Researchers&rdquo; helpful (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/guidelines">http://www.arcus.org/guidelines</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Proposals Involving Human Subjects<br /></strong>The NSF Grant Proposal Guide (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg</a>)
provides procedural information for projects with human subjects in the section Projects Involving
Human Subjects. Investigators must ensure that human subjects are protected from research risks in
conformance with the relevant federal policy known as the Common Rule (<em>Federal Policy for the
Protection of Human Subjects</em>, 45 CFR 690). Additional information is available at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp</a>.
Letters of permission or approval, such as those from Native organizations or communities in which
the work will take place, should be included in the Supplementary Documents section of proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Proposals Involving Arctic Field Work</strong></p>
<p>The Arctic Research Support and Logistics (RSL) program was created to enhance access and safety
in the Arctic and interactions with arctic communities. Investigators are encouraged to propose
effective and efficient use of logistics resources to reach research goals and cooperate with
communities near field research sites. Support from the RSL program is available to projects funded
by the Arctic Sciences Division, pending availability of funds. The program endeavors to leverage
support to projects funded by other divisions at NSF or other federal agencies also pending
availability of funds. More information is available on the RSL program web site (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/res_log_sup.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/res_log_sup.jsp</a>).</p>
<p>The Foundation and researchers to whom it makes awards are obliged to conform to the various acts
governing activities affecting the environment and cultural or historic properties. Researchers
should be aware of these acts and adhere to their requirements. Further information concerning
environmental issues is provided below under the heading 'Environmental Policy Considerations of
Fieldwork'.</p>
<p><em>Requesting support</em></p>
<p>The Arctic Sciences Division does not require the use of logistics forms for arctic fieldwork.
However, for proper review of the proposed work and to initiate logistics planning, the anticipated
fieldwork should be described in the proposal in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to appreciate
the scope of logistics requirements. Proposals are encouraged to include a section in the Project
Description outlining the planned fieldwork, schedule, locations, required services and platforms,
maps and related information.</p>
<p>If a third-party is arranging logistics (a logistics contractor or provider receiving funds
directly from NSF), logistics costs should not be included in the proposal budget request. Instead,
a description of the support required and cost if known should be included in the budget
justification to allow the logistics provider and reviewers to assess the scope, cost and
feasibility and initiate planning. Contact all third-party logistics providers prior to proposal
submission to let them know what you are planning. If time allows, these providers should provide a
letter to include in the supplementary documents section that describes the scope of logistics
support required and estimates the cost.</p>
<p><em>Timing of Requests</em></p>
<p>Proposals requesting support for field work from the Arctic Division science or logistics
programs should be submitted a year or more in advance of the field season to allow for logistics
planning and budgeting. For example, proposals submitted in autumn 2008 should not plan to go to the
field in summer of 2009, but rather in 2010. Third-party logistics providers may be able to
accommodate shorter planning times but should be consulted prior to proposal submission to verify
feasibility and availability of funds to support the request.</p>
<p><strong>Logistics Providers and Field Stations</strong></p>
<p>The RSL program works with several organizations to meet the needs of arctic field research.
NSF&rsquo;s prime arctic logistics contractor is CH2M Hill Polar Services (CPS; <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.polar.ch2m.com/">http://www.polar.ch2m.com/</a>), formerly known as VECO Polar
Resources. CPS can provide advanced planning for projects, regardless of whether they ultimately
provide the logistics services. CPS supports projects throughout the Arctic, including Greenland,
Russia, Canada, Svalbard, Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. They are helpful in proposal preparation and
can provide logistics scope letters to establish the feasibility and estimated cost of proposed
logistics. They do not charge proposers for this service. Investigators are encouraged to contact
CPS to develop a preliminary plan and to provide project support if appropriate. The RSL program
will work with CPS, the investigator and funding program manager to determine if requests are
supportable.</p>
<p><strong>Barrow, Alaska<br /></strong> Researchers proposing to work near Barrow, Alaska are
required to contact the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC) prior to submission of a proposal.
Please use the online logistics help form available on their website (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/basc/">http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/basc/</a>). BASC funding is through a
cooperative agreement with the RSL program. Support requested from BASC must be approved by NSF
through the cooperative agreement mechanism, thus BASC cannot make commitments, but can scope out
the type and cost of support requested and provide it if approved by the RSL program or paid for
directly by the user. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Greenland<br /></strong> Principal investigators contemplating work in Greenland should
obtain the Danish Polar Center application form for research in Greenland. Application forms are
available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.dpc.dk/sw6492.asp">http://www.dpc.dk/sw6492.asp</a>. A copy of the
application should be included in the Supplementary Documents section of the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Toolik Field Station, Alaska<br /></strong> Researchers proposing to work at Toolik Field
Station are required to contact the station prior to submission of a proposal to ensure the project
can be accommodated, see (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.uaf.edu/toolik/">http://www.uaf.edu/toolik/</a>).
Please use their online reservations forms to request use of the facilities. Toolik is funded by a
cooperative agreement between the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks
and the RSL program. The RSL program will work with the investigator, funding program manager,
Toolik and CH2M Hill to determine if requests can be supported.</p>
<p><strong>UNOLS, USCG, and other Vessel Requests</strong></p>
<p>Researchers intending to use a vessel from the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) or&nbsp; U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) vessels should follow the UNOLS procedure (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.unols.org/">http://www.unols.org/</a>). If requesting use of a non-UNOLS or USCG
vessel, please include a letter from the vessel operator with an estimate of the costs,
supportability, and approximate schedule of the work in the proposal supplementary documents. The
RSL program will work with the vessel operator and the investigator to determine if the request is
supportable.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Logistics Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drilling Services</strong></p>
<p>For ice core and other drilling services, please select your preferred provider and request an
estimate to include in your proposal. Ice Core Drilling Services (ICDS) has provided drilling
support to arctic projects. For drilling services through ICDS or any other provider, please contact
them during the proposal stage for an estimate of costs and include this estimate and a letter from
ICDS in the supplementary documents of your proposal (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/icds/">http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/icds/</a>). The RSL
program will work with the investigator, funding program manager, and their selected drilling
provider to determine if the request can be supported.</p>
<p><strong>GPS and Ground-based LiDAR</strong></p>
<p>UNAVCO (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.unavco.org">http://www.unavco.org</a>) is a non-profit organization
funded by a cooperative agreement with NSF&rsquo;s Earth Sciences Division to support and promote
Earth science by advancing high-precision geodetic and strain techniques such as the Global
Positioning System (GPS). UNAVCO provides state-of-the-art GPS equipment and field engineering
support for projects, by installing, operating and maintaining continuous GPS networks globally,
undertaking new technology development and evaluating commercially available products for research
applications, and by archiving GPS data and data products for future applications. UNAVCO maintains
Differential GPS stations, has developed a ground-based LiDAR capability and provides other services
to arctic researchers. Investigators should contact Bjorn Johns at UNAVCO (<a href="mailto:bjorn@unavco.org">bjorn@unavco.org</a> or
303-381-7470) for a proposal letter and budget estimate to include in the supplementary documents
section of the proposal. NSF will work with the investigator and UNAVCO to determine if the request
can be supported.</p>
<p><strong>National </strong><strong>Center </strong><strong>for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)</strong></p>
<p>NCALM is supported through a cooperative agreement with NSF&rsquo;s Earth Sciences Division to provide laser mapping services to
projects. If you need such services, please contact NCALM about your project needs and include a
letter with an estimate of costs from NCALM in the supplementary documents of your proposal (<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ncalm.org/">http://www.ncalm.org/</a>). NSF will work with the investigator and
NCALM to determine if the request can be supported.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Policy Considerations of Fieldwork</strong></p>
<p>Federal agencies must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Most NSF awards
support individual scientific research projects and are not considered &lsquo;major Federal actions
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment&rsquo;. Projects involving
construction, drilling or major disturbance to the local environment may require an assessment of
environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In addition to NEPA, all federal agencies are regulated under acts such as the Endangered Species
Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Researchers
proposing work that may affect cultural or historic properties, or whose work involves tribal lands
must cooperate with the agency in complying with the consultation requirements of section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. For additional information on cultural or historic preservation
issues, see the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's web site at <a
href="http://www.achp.gov/work106.html">http://www.achp.gov/work106.html</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers proposing projects with fieldwork involving perturbation of the environment,
excavation of archaeological sites, use of underwater seismic air guns, drilling, construction, or
other activity that may be considered a major Federal action should contact the Environmental
Officer of the Office of Polar Programs, Dr. Polly Penhale (<a
href="mailto:ppenhale@nsf.gov">ppenhale@nsf.gov</a>) for guidance on environmental consultations,
permitting, and NSF&rsquo;s obligations under existing environmental laws.</p>

<a name="review" id="review"></a>
<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed
if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a
scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten
other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal.
These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process.
Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to
review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may
serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion.
Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no
conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>

<h4>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review
criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances,
however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of
certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below.
The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and
not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria,
reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being
considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />How important is the proposed activity to
advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well
qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer
will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest
and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and
organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p><p><strong>What are
the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />How well does the activity advance
discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the
proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity,
disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and
education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be
disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits
of the proposed activity to society? </p></blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p><p>Mentoring
activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page
supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>

<a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding
decisions:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />One of the
principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education
through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.
These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume
responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts
that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
learning perspectives.</p><p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and
Activities</strong></em><br />Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all
citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is
essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle
of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and
supports.</p></blockquote>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal.
The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers
and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the
NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be
declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their
proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins
on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when
the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In
all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the
names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program
Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or
decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for
funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business,
financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement.
Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations
or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF
should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal
Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant
or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own
risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in
the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as
promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of
reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal
Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p></p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable
to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by
categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific
approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award
letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research
Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by
reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF

<p><strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong>
	<p><strong>Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic:</strong> Principal
	Investigators are expected to follow the <em>Principles for the Conduct of Research in the
	Arctic</em>, prepared by the Social Science Task Force of the U.S. Interagency Arctic Research
	Policy Committee (IARPC) and approved by IARPC in 1990. These principles are listed at <a
	href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp</a>.
	Investigators may find useful the Guidelines for Improved Cooperation between Arctic Researchers
	and Northern Communities (<a
	href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.arcus.org/guidelines">http://www.arcus.org/guidelines</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Scientific Data (OPP 9-91)</strong></p>
<p>This statement provides guidelines from the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) at the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and sets out special conditions applicable to OPP grants to implement the
Foundation's Sharing Policy by assuring timely submission of OPP-award data to national data centers
and other OPP-specified repositories for secondary use by the scientific community. The Office of
Polar Programs, in conformance with NSF policy (see Grant Proposal Guide, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a>
), expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and
within a reasonable time, the data, derived data products, samples, physical collections and other
supported materials gathered or created in the course of the research project. The purpose of this
policy is to facilitate full and open access to data and materials for polar research from projects
supported by OPP.</p>
<p><strong>General Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>For all OPP supported projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All data and derived data products collected under OPP-awards, which are appropriate for
	submission to a national data center or OPP-specified data repository (OPP-approved web site),
	should be promptly submitted within a reasonable amount of time, as described below, in&nbsp;
	responsibilities of Principal Investigators of OPP-Awards.</li>
	<li>OPP considers the documentation of data sets, known as metadata, as vital to the exchange of
	information on polar research and to a data set&rsquo;s accessibility and longevity for
	reuse.</li>
	<li>Data archives of OPP-supported projects should include easily accessible information about
	the data holdings, including quality assessments, supporting ancillary information, and guidance
	for locating and obtaining the data.</li>
	<li>National and international standards should be used to the greatest extent possible for the
	collection, processing and communication of OPP-sponsored data sets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of Principal Investigators of OPP-Funded Awards</strong></p>
<p>Principal investigators should make their data available to all reasonable requests and where
applicable the principal investigators should submit the data collected to designated data centers
as soon as possible, but no later than two (2) years after the data are collected. Data sets from
Arctic Observing Network projects are expected to be made publicly available immediately upon
collection.</p>
<p>Principal investigators working in coordinated programs (multi-investigator and/or multi-agency
programs) may (in consultation with the OPP program managers and other funding agencies involved)
establish more stringent data submission procedures to meet the needs of these larger coordinated
programs. Principal Investigators with OPP-funded awards should comply with data policies
established for these coordinated programs and submit their data as required to the appropriate
repository stipulated by the coordinated program office.</p>
<p>Compliance with the data guidelines will be considered in the program managers overall evaluation
of a Principal Investigator&rsquo;s prior support record.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions for OPP Awards</strong></p>
<p>Principal Investigators of OPP-funded awards are REQUIRED to submit to appropriate electronic
data directories, a description of their data (i.e., metadata) resulting from OPP-funded research in
the form of a Directory Interchange Format (DIF) entry. Submission of the DIF may be at any time
during the tenure of the grant. At the time of submission of the Final Report to NSF, a copy of the
DIF must be sent to the cognizant program officer in OPP. Failure to provide final technical reports
delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for that Principal Investigator. Principal
Investigators should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability
of required data. Sample DIFs can be found on the Global Change Master Directory web page at <a
href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov">http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Data sets from OPP supported arctic scientific research should go to the appropriate data center
for the specific type of data collected. Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to
the cognizant program officer in the Office of Polar Programs.</p>

<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal
Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days
before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project
reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final
project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the
required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report will delay NSF review
and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs
should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required
data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through
FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports
provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and
organizational), publications, and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be
required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
using the electronic system. Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification
by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report
must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared
specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted
on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National
Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF
is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and
welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and
engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering.
It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities,
K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations
throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic
institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for
research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition,
the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The
agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities,
certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also
supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international
scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic
level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide
funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on
NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding
preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device
for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals
with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or
general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800)
877-8339.</p><p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703)

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority
of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will
be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by
awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to
Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as
part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data
regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to
government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete
assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding
applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate
programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal
administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers
or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>,
&quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410
(May 12, 2004), and <a
