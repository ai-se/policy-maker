		<p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award
		Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF
		11-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals
		submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that the
		guidelines contained in <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF
		11-1</a> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding
		opportunity. Proposers who opt to submit prior to January 18, 2011, must
		also follow the guidelines contained in <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF
		11-1</a>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG has been revised to
		implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost
		sharing. Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In
		order to assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources
		necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and
		Other Resources section of the proposal. The description should be narrative
		in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information.
		Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by
		the NSF Director. See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide (GPG)
		</em><a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2gxi">Chapter
		II.C.2.g(xi)</a> for further information about the implementation of these
		recommendations.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG
		contains a clarification of NSF's long standing data policy. All proposals
		must describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of
		research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. FastLane will
		not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan.
		The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit
		or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as appropriate. Links to data
		management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates,
		Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF
		website at: <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>.

		this requirement.</p>
		<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each proposal that requests funding to support
		postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a
		description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such
		individuals. Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit
		submission of a proposal that is missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring
		Plan. See <a

		<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

		<p>The Office of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI)
		provides funding opportunities for interdisciplinary teams of
		researchers to embark on rapidly advancing frontiers of fundamental
		engineering research. EFRI seeks proposals with potentially
		transformative ideas that represent an opportunity for a significant
		shift in fundamental engineering knowledge with a strong potential for
		long term impact on national needs or a grand challenge. For this
		solicitation, EFRI will consider proposals that aim to investigate
		emerging frontiers in the following two specific research areas: (1)
		Engineering New Technologies Based on Multicellular and Inter-kingdom
		Signaling (MIKS), and (2) Mind, Machines, and Motor Control (M3C). The proposals must meet the detailed requirements delineated in
		this solicitation.</p><p><strong>1) Engineering New Technologies
		Based on Multicellular and Inter-kingdom Signaling (MIKS)</strong>
		</p><p>The importance and complexity of multicellular signaling, either
		between populations of the same species of organism or between species
		or kingdoms in driving the behavior and/or phenotype of these systems is
		becoming increasingly evident. For example, quorum sensing
		within bacterial communities can lead to epigenetic changes in the
		bacteria resulting in changes in growth patterns (from planktonic to
		biofilm) or virulence of the entire population. Signaling within
		multicellular organisms is responsible for the coordination of
		development, maintaining homeostasis, and responding to environmental
		stimuli. Between species or kingdoms, signaling behavior is often
		associated with host/pathogen interactions, symbiosis, and community
		behavior. </p><p align="left">Advances in microfabrication technologies,
		synthetic biology, protein engineering, mass spectrometry-driven omics
		and optical sensing now provide new opportunities to probe the
		complexities of molecular interactions associated with
		multicellular and inter-kingdom signaling in unprecedented ways. 
		Improved understanding of signaling, along with technologies created to
		detect, drive, or modulate signaling could lead the way to the
		development of novel engineered systems that address a number of
		national needs in the areas of human health, the environment, and
		energy. MIKS provides an opportunity for partnerships among
		engineers, biologists, mathematical and physical scientists, and
		computer scientists to address the key elements of the fundamental
		research needed to understand and control signaling processes in complex
		multicellular and multi-kingdom systems. It is expected that
		research proposals submitted to this solicitation will contribute to the
		understanding of biological signaling systems, development of a
		rigorous engineering framework for the design and realization
		of topically-relevant engineered systems, and provide an
		intellectual framework for education in this emerging area.</p><p
		align="left"><strong>2) Mind, Machines, and Motor Control (M3C)
		</strong></p><p>The central theme of M3C is to establish
		experimentally verified, quantitative, mathematical theories of human
		sensory-motor control that can serve as predictive models for the design
		of machines for forceful physical interaction and cooperation with
		humans, and that consider the coupling with mental (perceptual and
		cognitive) factors. M3C would contribute to novel tools for
		the design and control of these machines both at the hardware and
		software levels. In addition, understanding the role of the mind
		in forceful physical interaction could translate into novel computer
		architectures, operating systems, algorithms, and associated hardware
		and software platforms. </p><p align="left">The key barrier is how
		little is understood about the way humans control their own bodies, and
		how much less about how they manipulate even the simplest objects or
		tools. Most studies of human-machine systems have tacitly assumed
		that the human plays the role of an information processor that relies on
		an input-output model of the manipulated object in order to control it. This paradigm often neglects the functional requirements of the
		interplay between physical interactions and mental states that occur
		between the human and the machine: while some interactions involve
		signal-based information feedback, others are energy based, requiring
		significant exchange of power. A fundamental theory of coupled
		physical/mental sensory motor control will transform the engineering of
		machines that work in physical contact with people, and help develop new

		<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

		<p><strong>1) Engineering New Technologies Based on
		Multicellular and Inter-kingdom Signaling
		(MIKS)</strong></p><p>Historically, multicellular signaling has been
		studied by applying a step change, such as by introducing a signaling
		molecule, and then measuring the system output. However,
		multicellular signaling networks are highly non-linear systems, and only
		by understanding and designing dynamic or orthogonal inputs can the true
		behavior of the systems be elucidated. The MIKS program seeks
		multidisciplinary approaches to examine and engineer new systems based
		on multicellular signaling in which a paradigm shift in the way
		signaling is studied is employed. For example, using molecular
		tools such as synthetic biology to manipulate signaling systems
		represents a transformational change in the way multicellular and
		inter-kingdom signaling has been studied. Other paradigm changing
		means of driving or controlling signaling are sought,
		including novel approaches to examine system output that results in
		the alteration of the behavior, epigenetic control, and/or phenotype of
		organisms for the benefit of health, food production, environment, or
		energy production.</p><p>MIKS proposals should stimulate new discoveries
		concerning the molecular basis of multicellular signaling, both within a
		single species and across kingdoms. In addition, research in this
		area should advance the development of novel technologies and
		multicellular engineered systems. </p><p>Advances in the understanding
		of multicellular and inter-kingdom signaling has the potential to effect
		numerous fields including developmental biology, ecology, food safety,
		infectious disease, environmental engineering, biotechnology, and
		bioengineering. Technologies developed because of advances in
		these areas could reduce incidence of foodborne illnesses, provide new
		treatments for antibiotic resistant organisms, or speed advances in
		tissue engineering. Technologies could also impact the areas of
		plant health, bioremediation and biorefining. In addition, there
		is a significant potential benefit from the development of the enabling
		technologies, particularly in systems and synthetic biology. These
		tools will then provide the avenues for discovery in bioenergy,
		biotechnology, bioengineering, and biomedical
		sciences.</p><p><strong>Required Multicellular and Inter-kingdom
		Signaling Elements:</strong></p><p align="left">To advance the
		frontier within the proposed EFRI topic, MIKS proposals must address the
		following three
		elements:</p><blockquote><p>MIKS1) Development
		of novel technologies or methods to characterize and measure the
		complex molecular interactions that underlie signaling, and cell
		response to
		signaling;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>MIKS2) Use
		of tools/technologies developed in (MIKS1) to advance our understanding
		and/or manipulation of the mechanisms of multicellular and inter-kingdom
		signaling; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>MIKS3) 
		Development of novel engineered multicellular and/or multikingdom
		systems OR other innovations based on the control of signaling that
		address an important national or societal
		need.</p></blockquote><p><strong>2) </strong>
		<strong>Mind, Machines, and Motor Control
		(M3C)</strong></p><p>The M3C program seeks
		multidisciplinary teams to conduct transformative research to understand
		fundamental principles of coupled human motor functions involving
		forceful physical interactions and their control by managing and
		influencing the neural activity of the brain. This may include
		basic tasks such as dexterous manipulations and fine motor control of
		the hand, walking, and more complex tasks needing specially acquired
		motor skills - e.g. in specific sports activities. Proposers are
		encouraged to consider and include sensory-motor functions encountered
		in the real world, where humans do not act in a vacuum but are
		physically and mentally coupled to other things (objects, tools,
		machines, other people) in their environment. On the horizon of
		M3C-related work will be the creation of systems that seamlessly
		integrate &quot;human&quot;, and &quot;machine&quot;. To realize
		these systems, experimentally-verified, quantitative, mathematical
		theories of human sensory-motor control that do not treat humans in
		isolation are urgently needed. Research and education in M3C draw
		from neuroscience, neuroengineering and neuromechanics, but projects
		responsive to the needs of the M3C program will place a clear emphasis
		on human motor behavior that involves physical interaction with
		application to engineering design. In doing so, these projects
		will integrate aspects of other fields that may include biomechanics,
		musculoskeletal dynamics, sensorimotor physiology, dynamics, control,
		optimization, and systems engineering.</p><p>Human-machine interaction,
		brain-machine interfaces, actuator and sensor design, therapeutic and
		entertainment robotics, orthotics and exoskeletons, prosthetics, motor
		neuroscience, and motor learning are some areas of current research
		activity that could serve as a basis for a well thought out research
		program. M3C responsive proposals should lead to a
		<strong>transformative understanding of mind, machine, and motor
		control</strong> and may include applications that deal with issues
		related to: (i) <em>enhancement of human motor capabilities</em>
		(assistance, rehabilitation, and augmentation) and the broad area of
		(ii) <em>connecting physical human-machine interactions and mental
		representations.</em></p><p>Successful proposals will focus on one or
		more of the following three key themes listed in (A), will leverage one
		or more of the emerging tools and technologies listed in (B), and will
		establish clear relevance to one or more of the application areas listed
		in (C).</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>A. Key Themes</strong></p><blockquote><strong>A.1 Learning and Skill
		Acquisition: </strong>Bicycles and violins are
		machines that take time to learn how to use properly. Without
		understanding the dynamics of this learning process, in particular the
		correlation between initial and ultimate levels of performance, it is
		difficult to systematically design and evaluate alternative designs. This problem becomes worse for machines that actively co-adapt -
		for example, a brain-machine interface that learns a map from neural
		activity to user intent, or a lower-limb prosthesis that learns how to
		walk over varied terrain in a way that minimizes the user's metabolic
		cost - but this type of co-adaption is critical to performance. A
		key part of any quantitative theory of human sensory-motor control must
		be a theory of motor learning. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>A.2
		Power transfer between a Human and a Machine: </strong>There
		is a general lack of theory predicting the physiological response to
		significant power transfer between a human and a machine. How can
		we predict the energetic cost of walking with an exoskeleton or a
		prosthetic before doing pre-clinical tests? How can we derive
		control and sensing strategies for these devices without trial and
		error? These questions must be answered in order to make the work
		generalizable. For example, what is the right balance between
		providing assistance and causing disuse atrophy with a powered
		prosthesis or orthosis? </blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>A.3
		Pre-clinical Evaluation: </strong>Collaboration between
		engineers, scientists, and clinicians can help improve pre-clinical
		evaluation. For example, analysis of robotic therapy integrates
		many different issues including coordination, strength, and
		stabilization. Furthermore, the process of human walking is a
		whole-body process, not something that can be confined to an analysis of
		the lower limbs. What metrics should be used for evaluation? Is it
		possible to treat coordination, strength, stability, etc. separately? M3C researchers must try to answer some of these basic questions
		in order to deal with more complex issues.</p></blockquote><p><strong>B.
		Tools and Technologies</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>B.1
		</strong><strong>Robotics:</strong> Use of robotic devices that
		enable functional experiments outside of the laboratory either directly
		or via telemanipulation (leveraging wireless communication and other
		technologies).</p><p><strong>B.2 Imaging: </strong>Use of biophysical
		sensors that allow detailed assessment of neural and muscular activity
		during physical human-machine interactions (in particular, neuromuscular
		activity that relates to hierarchical or higher-level cognitive
		function).</p><p><strong>B.3 Feedback: </strong>Use of targeted
		stimulation or other mechanisms for sensory substitution that explicitly
		close feedback loops in order to enhance functional performance during
		human-machine interaction.</p></blockquote><p><strong>C. Application
		Areas</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>C.1 Medical/Healthcare
		Applications: </strong>Engineered devices and systems, emphasizing
		mind, machines, and motor control that are assistive, therapeutic, or
		compensatory; enable mobility and independence, and facilitate physical
		interaction with the real world.
		</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>C.2 Industrial
		Applications: </strong>Robotic machines with a direct
		physical coupling to humans that may include areas such as
		telemanipulation, assembly, exoskeletons, and cargo handling. M3C
		research should have a transformative impact on designing and
		engineering these types of robotic machines.
		</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>C.3 Consumer
		Applications: </strong>Machines that work side by side with
		humans in the home, office, and elsewhere that could transition from
		concept to reality without having to do many years of testing will
		benefit from M3C research on human motor control.
		</p></blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p><strong>Required Mind, Machines, and Motor Control
		(M3C) Elements: </strong></p><p>To be considered for the M3C EFRI
		program, proposals must be primarily centered on human motor
		functions under forceful physical interaction that are appropriately
		augmented with ideas and experiments from neuroscience and related
		disciplines. Proposals must involve three or more investigators,
		and must include at least one from an engineering discipline and another
		investigator with neuroscience, behavioral psychology, cognitive
		science, medicine, or neurobiology expertise. The more competitive
		proposals will address at least two of the following M3C
		elements:</p><blockquote><p>M3C1) Experimentally validated theories of
		human-sensory motor control that will lead to predictive models to
		enable the design of machines for forceful physical interaction and
		cooperation with humans.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>M3C2) Perceptual
		and cognitive science based approaches that are primarily concerned with
		representing mental states that result from forceful physical
		interactions between human and machine.
		</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>M3C3) Model constructs with
		validation and verification enabling understanding and/or explanation of
		one or more important human sensory motor control functions.
		</p></blockquote><p>Proposals that focus exclusively on signal
		processing and computation (e.g., to study how networks of neurons
		encode information), on technology development (e.g., for persons with
		disability) that does not result in new theoretical foundations, or on
		infrastructure (e.g., sensor networks for data collection) are not
		expected to be competitive.</p>

		<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

		<a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>		
		<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program
		where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation
		requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist,
		engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by
		three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular
		fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by
		Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process.
		Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are
		especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they
		would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one
		source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's
		discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is
		taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the
		proposal.</p>
		
		<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
		<h4>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4>
		
		<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National
		Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit
		and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances,
		however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight
		the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p><p>The
		two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
		include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
		suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While
		proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be
		asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the
		proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to
		make judgements.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
			proposed activity?</strong><br />How important is the proposed activity
			to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across
			different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or
			team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment
			on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed
			activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially
			transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the
			proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to
			resources?</p><p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed
			activity?</strong><br />How well does the activity advance discovery and
			understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well
			does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented
			groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what
			extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education,
			such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will
			the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and
			technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed
			activity to society? </p>
		</blockquote>	
		
		<p>Examples illustrating activities likely
		to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF
		website at: <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p><p>Mentoring
		activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the
		project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be
		evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p><p>NSF staff
		also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding
		decisions:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<em><strong>Integration of Research and
			Education</strong></em><br />One of the principal strategies in support
			of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education
			through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic
			and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant
			opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities
			as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in
			joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and
			enrich research through the diversity of learning
			perspectives.</div><p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF
			Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />Broadening
			opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women
			and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
			is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF
			is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the
			programs, projects, and activities it considers and
			supports.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria: </strong></p>
		<p>In addition to the two NSF review criteria (intellectual merit and
		broader impacts), the following criteria will be used in the review of
		all EFRI proposals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>TRANSFORMATIVE
			</em>-</strong> Does the proposed research represent an opportunity for
			a significant leap or paradigm shift in fundamental engineering
			knowledge?</li>
			<li><em><strong>NATIONAL NEED/GRAND CHALLENGE
			</strong></em>- Is there potential for making significant progress on a
			current national need or grand challenge?</li>
			<li>Responsiveness to
			&quot;<strong>Required MIKS Elements</strong>&quot; for EFRI-M3C
			proposals <strong>or &quot;Required M3C Elements&quot;</strong> for
			EFRI-MIKS proposals delineated in Section II. Program
			Description.</li>
			<li>Effectiveness of the proposed plan for management
			and integration.</li>
		</ul>

		<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
		<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
		<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
		<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either
		support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage
		the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will
		formulate a recommendation.</p>
		<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration
		of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the
		cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or
		recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants
		whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding
		within six months. The time interval begins on the date of
		receipt. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the
		Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
		<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and
		submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as
		confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names
		of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project
		Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will
		receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
		<p>In developing its recommendations for awards, review panels as well
		as NSF staff will consider: the relative merit of the EFRI proposals
		using the criteria listed above, the potential national impact of the
		proposed activity, the balance of awards among scientific fields,
		geographical distribution, and the combined ability of the proposals to
		meet the objectives of the EFRI Office. The EFRI Office will not
		normally award more than one proposal from any one lead institution in
		this competition.</p>

		<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the
		proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of
		Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy
		implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other
		agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements
		Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or
		authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF
		should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF
		Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes
		financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or
		cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer
		does so at their own risk.</p>

		<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
		<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
		<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
		<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
		<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting
		organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and
		Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised
		as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the
		program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the
		reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.
		(See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review
		process.)</p>
		
		<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
		<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
		<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
		special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
		thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
		expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
		any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
		the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
		conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms
		and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may
		be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements
		also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement
		Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the
		applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are
		electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and
		transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p><p>*These
		documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.
		Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse,
		telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a
		href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p><p>More
		comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important
		information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF
		<em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available
		electronically on the NSF Website at <a
		href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong>Awardees must
		include in the proposal budget funds for travel by PI and one researcher
		or a student to attend an annual EFRI grantees' meeting.</p>

		<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
		<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>

		<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing
		grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report
		to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the
		current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent
		project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI
		also is required to submit a final project report, and a project
		outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the
		required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes
		report&nbsp;will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding
		increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should
		examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure
		availability of required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's
		electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for
		preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.
		&nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
		project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and,
		other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be
		required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a
		proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system.
		&nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by
		the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The
		project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using
		Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared
		specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project.
		This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted
		by the PI.</p><p>Awardees will be required to attend and
		present their research results and plans annually at an annual EFRI
		grantees' conference for the duration for their award.</p>

	<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal

	amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is
	&quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national
	health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in
	all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>

	<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and
	engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to
	more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses,
	informal science organizations and other research organizations
	throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of
	Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>

	<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research,
	education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are
	funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand
	applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency
	operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research
	Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic
	research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research
	between universities and industry, US participation in international
	scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every
	academic level.</p>

	<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with
	Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to
	enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See
	Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding
	preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

	<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf
	(TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that
	enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the
	Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD
	may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800)
	877-8339.</p>

	<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>

	<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is
	solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of
	1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in
	connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project
	reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and
	reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information
	requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants
	as part of the proposal review process; to proposer
	institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal
	review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to
	government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and
	educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government
	agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or
	nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to
	coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or
	party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government
	is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to
	the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as
	peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records,
	NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
	Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51,
	&quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal
	Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is
	voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however,
	may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>

	<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
	respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office
	of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number
	for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this
	collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per
	response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments
	regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of
