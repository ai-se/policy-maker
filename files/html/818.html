		SUBJECT: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR TEACHERS (RET)<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPLEMENT 
		TO CURRENT NSF AWARDS<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Dear Colleague:</p>
	  <p>This letter is to call your attention to a new activity that will support 
		active participation by K-12 teachers of science and mathematics in research 
		and education projects funded by the Directorate for Computer and Information 
		Sciences and Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation. The 
		intent of this activity is to facilitate professional development of K-12 
		teachers through strengthened partnerships between institutions of higher 
		education and local school districts. CISE strongly encourages its grantees, 
		including grantees from the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) 
		and the Small Business Technology Research (STTR) programs, to make special 
		efforts to identify talented teachers for participation in this RET-supplement 
		opportunity. </p>
	  <p>Encouraging active participation of teachers in on-going NSF projects 
		is an excellent way to reach broadly into the teacher talent pool of our 
		nation. The goal of the RET-supplements is to help build long-term collaborative 
		relationships between K-12 teachers of science and mathematics and the 
		NSF research community. CISE is particularly interested in encouraging 
		the researchers it supports to build mutually rewarding partnerships with 
		teachers at inner city schools and less well endowed school districts.</p>
	  <p>A request for funding of an RET supplement should be made under an existing 
		NSF/CISE award or within a proposal for a new or renewal NSF/CISE award. 
		The description of the RET activity should clearly articulate in some 
		detail the form and nature of the prospective teacher's involvement in 
		the Principal Investigator's ongoing or proposed research. For example, 
		the teacher may participate in the design and analysis of algorithms, 
		development of software systems and networks, modeling of knowledge and 
		data bases, and other activities that will result in intellectual contributions 
		to the project. It is expected that the RET supplement experience will 
		also lead to transfer of new knowledge to classroom activities. Therefore, 
		the RET supplement description should also indicate what type of sustained 
		follow-up will be provided to help in translating the teacher's research 
		experience into classroom practice. A brief biographical sketch of the 
		teacher should also be included.</p>
	  <p>The duration of the RET Supplement will be one year and the project may 
		be carried out during summer months, academic year, or both. The total 
		cost of the supplement is limited to $10,000 per teacher. The budget includes 
		a teacher's stipend and up to $1,000 for the cost of materials, equipment, 
		software and other supplies for developing classroom instructions and 
		experiments. An administrative allowance (limited to 25% of the teacher's 
		stipend only) is allowed in lieu of indirect costs. Normally, funds may 
		be available for one to two teachers, but exceptions will be considered. 
		Participation of teachers who are members of underrepresented groups (women, 
		underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities) is strongly 
		encouraged. An award decision will be based on internal review by the 
		cognizant CISE Program Director and availability of funds in a particular 
		program. An application for an RET Supplement must be submitted via the 
		NSF FastLane and the procedure is the same as described in the Research 
		Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program Announcement, NSF 01-121, 
		(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf01121/nsf01121.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf01121/nsf01121.htm</a>), 
		for the submission of an REU Supplement request. For guidance concerning 
		the RET Supplement, the Principal Investigator should consult with the 
		Program Director of his/her particular NSF award. An RET Supplement request 
		is due by May 15, 2002.</p>
	  <p>The National Science Foundation encourages you to visit K-12 teachers 
		in your local school district and region to make them aware of this RET 
		opportunity as well as other NSF research and educational projects.</p>
	  <p>Information on current NSF awards is readily available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_awards.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_awards.htm</a>. 
		We trust that your time and efforts will open and facilitate new avenues 
		for collaboration and innovations in the teaching of mathematics, science 
		and engineering and enhance the development of the U.S. science and engineering 
		workforce.</p>
	  <p>Sincerely,</p>

		Electronic Dissemination Only</h4>
	  <h4><br>
		Background Information</h4>
	  <p>The Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Supplements program was started 
		by the Directorate of Engineering in FY 2001. The purpose of the program 
		is to encourage research activity in middle and high school teachers by 
		creating opportunities for them to work with NSF-funded researchers. In 
		FY 2002, the program has been extended to include K-12 teachers and to 
		also support RET sites.</p>
	  <p>The Directorate of Computer and Information Sciences (CISE) feels that 
		RET is a good program that can result in engaging a large, talented populace 
		in research. Through the involvement of teachers, the program can introduce 
		students to the state-of-the-art research results, raise the standard 
		of scientific and engineering education, and potentially involve students 
		themselves in research. For these reasons, CISE would like to offer RET 
		supplements in FY 2002 to CISE awardees. These supplements can be used 
		for K-12 teachers. Depending on this year's outcome, CISE might continue 
		and expand the program in future years.</p>
	  <p>For FY 2002, CISE is allocating from the AD reserve $800K which will 
		suffice for 80 supplements. Selection of supplement for award will be 
		made by a CISE RET coordinator upon recommendation of the program officer 
		receiving the supplement request. Individual CISE programs can make additional 
		supplements from their own funds.</p>
