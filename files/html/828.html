<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>FastLane
Announcement #01-01</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>This announcement discusses several
recent and upcoming changes to the FastLane system including user documentation,
support for various file upload formats, solutions for MSIE 5.5, easy ways
to get your password reset, revised proposal budget information, reviewer
system changes, enhancements to the interactive panel system, how to update
your organization’s information online and an upcoming common PI/co-PI
login.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>User Documentation</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>User documentation on proposal preparation
and basic organizational management functions has been greatly expanded.
The new documentation, available presently in PDF format, may be viewed
or downloaded under FastLane Advisories on the FastLane Homepage ( <a href="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/">www.fastlane.nsf.gov</a>
).</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>File Uploads in Various Formats</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>FastLane now supports file uploads
in a variety of formats including Word, WordPerfect, PostScript and TeX
(MiKTeX1.20e). You should continue to use standard fonts to avoid font
substitutions and you will need to proofread and accept the uploaded files.
PDF files will continue to be accepted if properly created for merging
into a single proposal (e.g. ensuring that all fonts are embedded, the
files is saved in Acrobat 3 format and that PDFWriter was not used to create
the file). For more information on supported document types, see <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a1/A1AcceptableFileExtensions.html">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a1/A1AcceptableFileExtensions.html</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Note that one of the advantages of
PDF files is that the resulting document is supposed to look the same to
everyone viewing it. Adobe Acrobat Reader allows users to choose a "fit-to-page"
option when printing a file. As this distorts the output depending (e.g.
margins and fonts sizes) upon the printer chosen, users should not choose
this option when printing out their PDF files. Otherwise, a PDF file that
may appear compliant with NSF font size and margin requirements on your
printer may appear non-compliant to everyone else. The "fit-to-page" option
is not used by NSF’s Proposal Processing Unit when printing proposals at
NSF. Therefore, the resulting printed copy at NSF appears at the same scale
as the original.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5
(MSIE 5.5)</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>FastLane is one of the few web sites
serving PDF files using a secure server and using secure means of posting
the files to browsers. Past users of MSIE 5.5 would see a blank screen
when trying to view PDF files in FastLane. Microsoft’s Critical Problem
Resolution unit has been working on a correction for the MSIE 5.5 Service
Pack #1 and for future versions of MSIE. It is still being tested by Microsoft.
In the interim, FastLane has programmed a workaround for proposal preparation
and will be implementing that in other areas (e.g. proposal review) shortly.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Password Reset</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>An automated password reset function
is now available in FastLane for users who forget their passwords (see
"Password Reset" on login pages). Once the user is authenticated through
information presently in our database, a one-time password is generated,
stored in one-way encrypted format in FastLane, and sent by e-mail to the
address on record. As with virtually all FastLane functions, the password
reset function is available all the time. Therefore, users no longer need
to wait to contact the FastLane Help Desk or their</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Sponsored Research Office.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Organization Basic Information Changes</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Organizational Management now has an
additional permission (Review/Revise Organizational Information) that allows
authorized users to update in NSF’s records for an organization’s address,
phone number, FAX number, e-mail address, EIN/TIN and DUNS number. The
change is immediate. Name changes cannot be performed online. Instead,
organizational management users will need to e-mail <a href="mailto:dgafast@nsf.gov">dgafast@nsf.gov</a>
to inform NSF of these changes.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Revised Proposal Budgets</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>PIs can now assign their Revised Proposal
Budgets a PIN which can be used by other FastLane users to prepare and
forward the revised proposal budget to the PI's Sponsored Research Office.
Users can now add senior personnel to their revised proposal budgets. Please
note that Revised Proposal Budgets submitted via FastLane do NOT require
a paper copy to be signed and mailed to NSF.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Frequently when revised proposal budgets
are submitted, the Principal Investigator has additional material that
may also need to be submitted to NSF in order for a Program Officer to
make a final recommendation on the proposal. Examples of such material
are: documentation regarding collaborative arrangements of significance
to the proposal or research involving the use of human subject, hazardous
material, vertebrate animals etc.). Until another mechanism is created
in FastLane by which to transmit such material electronically to NSF the
PI may scan the special information and supplementary documentation into
the PDF file that contains the Impact Statement.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Review System Changes and Print-on-Demand
Pilot</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>FastLane is making a number of enhancements
to the Proposal and Panel Review systems. Based upon input from program
offices, the user screens now have a different look and feel. The new screens
in panel review include tabs which allow the selection of action type and
a sort feature that will allow the user to sort proposals via a variety
of column headers. Reviewer type has been added as a column header. Both
systems now let reviewers download and save a proposal as a PDF file to
their computer without first needing to view the proposal with Adobe Acrobat.
The capability for panelists to be able to bundle together multiple proposals
for download, with options for file compression, will be added later this
year.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>A new pilot consisting of ten volunteer
programs will not automatically send reviewers paper copies of proposals.
Rather, for reviewers in these programs, an option will appear in FastLane
to have paper copies of the proposals sent through the mail.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>The print-on-demand function is expected
to be available for other programs later this year.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Interactive Panel System (Panel
Meeting System)</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Based upon a design team from NSF users
in program offices and input from panelists, a new look and some additional
features are planned for the second week in April. A version will be available
for users to try on our demonstration site by March 26.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Common PI/co-PI Login</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>FastLane has developed a common login
for Principal Investigators (PIs), co-Principal Investigators and other
authorized users. Implementation is planned on or about March 20. At the
present time, there are ten separate logins available to PIs and many of
these require PIs to remember their proposal or award ID numbers. The new
login, available for review at our demonstration site ( <a href="http://www.fldemo.nsf.gov/">www.fldemo.nsf.gov</a>
), will allow PIs to log into one application instead. PIs then choose
a function (e.g. preparing a proposal or a project report).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>If the function is associated with
an award, they are given a list of existing awards, by number and title,
to select. A similar login is available for "other authorized users" who
will be able to access, through a PIN provided by the PI or co-PI, proposal
preparation, project reporting, revised proposal budgets (<b>new!</b>)
and other functions. While this new common login will allow access to all
PI functions, the existing separate login links will remain for several
weeks while users become familiar with the new entry into the system. A
common login for panelists is also planned.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Request for Supplemental Funding</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Last October, FastLane added a new
module for supplemental funding.&nbsp; No longer does a PI enter a request
for a supplement through Notifications and Requests. To request a supplement,
the PI will select the existing award at the beginning of the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A temporary proposal is created.&nbsp; The PI must provide, at a minimum,
a summary of the work to be accomplished, a justification, and a budget.&nbsp;
When the SRO submits the supplement, a new proposal is created.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Within five working days, for organization's
not participating in the electronic signature pilot, the signed budget
must be mailed to NSF program staff.&nbsp; Although a cover sheet is generated
by FastLane, the institution and PI cannot, and need not modify it.&nbsp;
Participants in the electronic signature pilot do not send the budget to
NSF.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Here is a list of enhancements made
to award supplement recently:</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>1. The top of the cover sheet is
stamped "Supplement" so it can be readily identified.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>2. Page 2 is stamped "No Signature
Required" in the signature block, as a reminder that the cover sheet does
not need to be mailed to NSF.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>3. Two buttons were added to the Form
Preparation screen, "Supplemental Docs" and "Add/Delete Non Co-PI Senior
Personnel."&nbsp; This will assist PIs preparing supplements for various
research opportunities.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>4. At the bottom of the SRO submission
screen, a reminder was added that they must send a signed budget, but not
the cover sheet (except for those participating in the electronic signature
pilot).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>5. On April 1<sup>st</sup>, the "Other"
button in Notifications and Requests will be disabled.&nbsp; Until then,
if a PI or SRO chooses that option, a warning message states that this
option will be disabled on April 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; They are directed
to the new module.&nbsp; At the bottom of this screen, we added a button
saying "Continue" so processing can continue until then.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>6. In several places, text was changed
from Supplemental "Proposal" to Supplemental "Request."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>7. The word "Funding" was deleted from
the Justification label on the forms preparation screen.&nbsp; It was being
confused with a budget requirement.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>8. The text in the e-mail message to
PIs was revised slightly, reminding them to send the budget (except for
those participating in the electronic signature pilot), but not the cover
sheet.</font></font></dir>

The Custom News Service has added a subtype labeled "FastLane Announcements"
under the document type "Proposal Announcements &amp; Information." All
current Custom News Service subscribers who signed up for documents under
Program Announcements will automatically receive FastLane Announcements.
Those recipients who use the Custom News Service but do not want to receive
FastLane Announcements should edit their profiles and uncheck the FastLane
Announcements box under the "Proposal Announcements &amp; Information"
subtypes list.</font></font>
