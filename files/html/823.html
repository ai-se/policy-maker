                    since you have a tenure-track position. You may wish to apply 
                    for NSF research support through the programs in your area

                  <p> <b>A. </b>Yes, persons who have taken 2 to 8 years off to

                  <p> <b>A. </b> The ADVANCE guidelines list three categories

                    for the Fellows awards in addition to the requirements that 
                    all applicants have to hold a Ph.D. in a field of science 
                    or engineering supported by NSF, be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national 
                    or permanent resident of the United States, and be establishing 
                    a full-time independent academic research and education career

                    or possessions, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. You must 
                    meet one of the eligibility requirements to apply for a Fellows 
                    awards, and when you submit your proposal you will have to 
                    certify which of the three criteria you meet. In your proposal, 
                    you will need to provide a brief narrative of your career 
                    history and accomplishments to date and describe the likely

                    position. Am I eligible to apply?</b></p>
                  <p> <b>A. </b>There is no requirement under this part of the 
                    Fellows program for an applicant to have had a tenure-track 
                    position. It appears that you have been out of the full-time 
                    science and engineering (S&E) workforce for 2 to 8 years to 
                    attend to family responsibilities and will be out of this 
                    workforce on the proposal due date. Therefore, you may be 
                    eligible to apply if you meet other eligibility requirements 
                    for the Fellows awards.</p>
                  <p><b>Q. I left my planned career path as an assistant professor 
                    in 1995 in order to raise my children. I am currently employed 
                    in a "soft money" position in a nearby university. Though 
                    my position could be considered as in the "full-time science 
                    and engineering workforce," it is a significant diversion 
                    from my planned career path and does not involve research 
                    or teaching. I would like to apply for the ADVANCE Fellows 
                    program to reestablish my research and teaching experience 
                    so that at the end of the program I am in a position to once 
                    again secure an academic position at an undergraduate institution. 
                    Am I eligible to apply? </b>
                  <p><b>A. </b>You would not be eligible for the ADVANCE program 
                    under the criterion you mentioned because the program solicitation 
                    says that the applicant "on the proposal due date, be out 
                    of the full-time science and engineering workforce and have 
                    been out of this workforce for 2 to 8 years to attend to family 
                    responsibilities". Since your position is full-time, you wouldn't 
                    qualify under that criterion.</p>
                  <p><b>Q. I received my Ph.D. in 1993 and worked in a full-time 
                    position at a national laboratory from 1994-1998. I resigned 
                    my position in 1998 for my husband's relocation. A year later, 
                    I started work as a research assistant professor (a non-tenure-track 
                    position). The appointment ends this year. Am I eligible to 
                    apply?</b></P>
                  <p> <b>A. </b> You would not be eligible under the relocation 
                    of a spouse criterion, as your resignation from full-time 
                    employment was more than 24 months ago.</p>

                  <p><b>Q. I am writing to ascertain whether applicants for a 
                    "Fellows Award" can be male. I relocated (leaving behind a 
                    tenure-track appointment) so that my wife could accept a tenure-track 
                    appointment. I accepted a temporary visiting position, at 
                    significantly lower rank and wages, and with a significantly 
                    higher teaching load than my counterparts who were recently 
                    hired in my department with tenure-track status. Indeed, my 
                    salary dropped significantly relative to my previous position. 
                    On the ADVANCE web page, the word "spouse" (rather than "husband") 
                    is used throughout, which leads me to believe that it might 
                    also be your intention to support men who have delayed their 
                    own careers to support their wives. Please let me know. </b> 
                  <p><b>A. </b>Yes, you are eligible if your wife is in a science 
                    or engineering field that is supported by NSF and your resignation 
                    from the tenure track position occurred in the 24 months preceding 
                    the proposal due date. You must also hold a Ph.D. in a field 
                    of science or engineering supported by NSF; be a U.S. citizen, 
                    U.S. national or permanent resident of the United States; 
                    and, at the time of award, be establishing a full-time independent 
                    academic research and education career at an institution of 
                    higher learning in the U.S., its territories or possessions, 
                    or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>

                    We have both received invitations to spend the year at the 
                    national laboratory where I was formerly employed. The ADVANCE 
                    Program would be an ideal opportunity for me to initiate a 
                    new program with the laboratory and perhaps continue it with 
                    a student when I return to my institution. Would I be eligible

                    I am not a postdoc anymore.</b></P>
                  <P> <B>A. </b>Since you are not longer in postdoctoral or equivalent 
                    status and do not meet the other eligibility criteria, you

                    In 1994, I received a PhD in Veterinary Medicine. I am currently 
                    employed as Research Associate Professor. I need to establish 
                    my own research funding. Am I eligible to apply?</b></P>
                  <P> <B>A. </b>The date of your PhD would make you ineligible 
                    for a Fellows post-doc award. You might be eligible for support 
                    in one of the other Fellows eligibility categories, but we 
                    would need more information to determine that. There are also 
                    restrictions on the type of research NSF supports. For example, 
                    research with disease-related goals, including work on the 
                    etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, 
                    abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or animals, is 
                    normally not supported. Animal models of such conditions or 
                    the development or testing of drugs or other procedures for 
                    their treatment also are not eligible for support. This is 
                    obliquely referenced in the solicitation: "Proposals submitted 
                    in response to this program announcement/solicitation should 
                    be prepared and submitted in accordance with the general guidelines 
                    contained in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG). The complete 
                    text of the GPG is available electronically on the NSF Web 
                    Site at: https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf012."</P>
                  <P>However the GPG clarifies that research in bioengineering, 
                    with diagnosis or treatment-related goals that applies engineering 
                    principles to problems in biology and medicine while advancing 
                    engineering knowledge is eligible for support. Bioengineering 
                    research to aid persons with disabilities also is eligible, 
                    as is research on the ecology of infectious disease.</P>

                  <p><b>Q. What is meant by U.S. national?</b></p>
                  <p> <b>A.</b> The term "nationals of the United States" designates 
                    citizens of the United States or native residents of a possession 
                    of the United States such as American Samoa. It does not refer 
                    to citizens of another country who have applied for U.S. citizenship.</p>

                  <p> <b>A.</b> No. In order to be eligible for a Fellows award, 
                    a PI must, at the time of award, be establishing a full-time,

                    physiology, specifically the neural control of active touch. 
                    However, I am not sure that this research is in field of science 
                    supported by NSF.</b></p>
                  <p> <b>A.</b> NSF does not support research with disease-related 
                    goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment 
                    of physical or mental disease, abnormality or malfunction 
                    in human beings or animals. For such research, the National 
                    Institutes of Health and private foundations would be the 
                    most likely sources of support. However, research in normal 
                    somatosensory physiology, is supported by NSF's Sensory Systems 
                    Program and would be supportable research under the ADVANCE 
                    guidelines. You can obtain more detailed information on the 
                    types of research supported by the NSF through the NSF Guide 
                    to Programs at https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/publicat/nsf013/how-to/toc.htm

                    for proposal submissions?</b></p>
                  <p> <b>A.</b> Only proposals submitted by your institution through 
                    FastLane before 5:00 p.m. (your local time) on or before the 
                    Directorate/Office deadline will be accepted. Because the 
                    volume of ADVANCE Fellows may be quite large and individuals 
                    who are not submitting through an institution must register 
                    as a FastLane organization before submitting a proposal, you 
                    are encouraged to start your FastLane proposal submission 
                    well before the ADVANCE Fellows deadline. Refer to the ADVANCE 
                    Guidelines for Submission and the FastLane Web page for more 
                    details. Any proposal received after the Directorate/Office 
                    deadline will be returned to the preparer without review. 
                    Please note that NSF program officers are not authorized to 
                    grant extensions to the deadline for the ADVANCE program.</p>
