        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>This funding partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) supports projects to develop and advance knowledge concerning endangered human languages. Made urgent by the imminent death of roughly half of the approximately 7000 currently used languages, this effort aims to exploit advances in information technology to build computational infrastructure for endangered language research. The program supports projects that contribute to data management and archiving, and to the development of the next generation of researchers. Funding can support fieldwork and other activities relevant to the digital recording, documenting, and archiving of endangered languages, including the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples, and databases. Funding will be available in the form of one- to three-year senior research grants as well as fellowships from six to twelve months.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Roughly half of the world's seven thousand languages are endangered and risk extinction.  These endangered languages constitute an irreplaceable treasure, not only for the communities who speak them, but also for scientists and scholars.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The great variety of these languages represents a vast, largely unmapped terrain on which linguists, anthropologists, and cognitive scientists can chart the full capabilities and limits of the human mind.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each endangered language embodies unique local knowledge of the cultures and natural systems in the region in which it is spoken.
            </li>
            <li>
              These languages are among the few sources of evidence for filling in the record of the human past.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Since the discipline of linguistics is a responsibility both of the National Science Foundation and of the National Endowment for the Humanities, addressing the imminent loss of linguistic knowledge is a major concern and a priority for both agencies.</p>
          <p>Recent advances in information technology can facilitate prompt and coordinated fieldwork. These advances make it possible not only to document endangered languages before they fall silent, but also to integrate and analyze that body of knowledge in unprecedented ways. Computerization of speech and universal Internet access is transforming the practice of linguistics in the area of endangered languages.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Linguists will be able to work from the same data sets rather than from informally collected data.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              The data will be searchable in a large variety of ways.  For example, finding all occurrences of a particular phoneme in a database will become feasible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The recorded sounds of a language will be available.  Linguists will be able to check written transcriptions; they will be able to focus more attention on such matters as intonation in syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interoperable digital repositories will be created.
            </li>
            <li>
               Interoperability will drive the development of a unified ontology for linguistics, eventually replacing inconsistent descriptive terminologies.</div>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The endangered languages belong to highly divergent language families, which often present the most extreme cases of language differentiation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This wider range of data will enable linguists to achieve much greater time depth, for example, in using the comparative method to reconstruct proto-languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              It will enable linguists to test more precisely claims about linguistic universals and about what humans can learn.
            </li>
            <li>
              It will enable computer scientists to test known computational methods and statistical computational tools, and to develop new ones.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A coordinated, sustained, and technologically sophisticated interagency initiative by these U.S. partner agencies is intended to complement efforts already underway elsewhere in the world sponsored by organizations in the UK (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.hrelp.org/">http://www.hrelp.org/</a>)  as well as by UNESCO (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://en.unesco.org/">http://en.unesco.org/</a>).</p>

        <h3> 
         II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Documenting Endangered Languages (DEL) is a joint funding program of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop and advance scientific and scholarly knowledge concerning endangered human languages. Made urgent by the imminent death of roughly half of the approximately 7000 currently used human languages, DEL seeks not only to acquire scientific data that will soon be unobtainable, but to integrate, systematize, and make the resulting linguistic findings widely available by exploiting advances in information technology.</p>
          <p>Principal Investigators (PIs) and Applicants for Fellowships (Applicants) may propose projects involving one or more of the following three emphasis areas:</p>
          
          <p><strong>1. Language Description</strong></p>
          <p>to conduct fieldwork to record in digital audio and video format one or more endangered languages; to carry out the early stages of language documentation including transcription and annotation; to carry out later stages of documentation including the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples, and databases; to conduct initial analysis of findings in the light of current linguistic theory.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Infrastructure</strong></p>
          <p>to digitize and otherwise preserve and provide wider access to such documentary materials, including previously collected materials and those concerned with languages which have recently lost all fluent speakers and are related to currently endangered languages; to create other infrastructures, including workshops and conferences to make the problem of endangered languages more widely understood and more effectively addressed.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Computational Methods</strong></p>
          <p>to further develop standards and databases to make this documentation of a certain language or languages widely available in consistent, archivable, interoperable, and Web-based formats; to develop computational tools for endangered languages, which present an additional challenge for statistical tools (taggers, grammar induction tools, parsers, etc.) since they do not have the large corpora for training and testing the models used to develop those tools; to develop new approaches to building computational tools for endangered languages, based on deeper knowledge of linguistics, language typology and families, which require collaboration between theoretical and field linguists and computational linguists (computer scientists).</p>
          <p>Accomplishing the goals of the DEL program may require multidisciplinary research teams and comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches across the sciences, engineering, education, and humanities, as appropriate. Interdisciplinary research combining the expertise of scientists expands the rewards of language documentation. In each emphasis area, DEL encourages collaboration across academic disciplines and /or communities. For example, a DEL project might pair linguists with computer scientists, geographers, anthropologists, educators and others as appropriate. Examples of community collaborations might include scholars working in well-defined partnerships with native speaker communities. DEL also encourages investigators to include in their projects innovative plans for training native speakers in descriptive linguistics and new technologies which support the documentation of endangered languages. The DEL program is also interested in contributing to a new generation of scholars through targeted supplements, which support both graduate and undergraduate research experience. DEL gives high priority to projects that involve actually recording in digital audio and video format endangered languages before they become extinct.</p>
          <p>Proposed projects may range from a single investigator working for six months to a team of investigators working for three years.</p>
          <p>Documentation is a key complement to language revitalization efforts, but DEL does not support projects to revive or expand the actual use of endangered languages. Tribal groups interested in the full range of language revitalization activities should contact the Native Language Program of the Administration for Native Americans in the Administration for Children &amp; Families of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/programs/program_information.html">(</a><a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/programs/native-language-preservation-maintenance">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/programs/native-language-preservation-maintenance</a><a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/programs/program_information.html">)</a>.</p>
          <p>However, the DEL program does encourage investigators from Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP)-eligible institutions to submit either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Senior research proposals</li>
            <li>Collaborative proposals from consortia of TCUP-eligible institutions and partnering universities with educational or research ties to TCUP-eligible institutions&rsquo; faculty or students (see &ldquo;eligibility information&rdquo; for definition of qualifying TCUP institutions). While one TCUP-eligible institution may be identified to take the lead on organizational activities, each institution will independently manage its award.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Examples of collaborations with TCUP-eligible institutions may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building TCU institutions' research and scholarly training capacity in documentary and descriptive linguistics, computational methodology, archiving and preservation;</li>
            <li>Attracting, retraining, and supporting TCU students in independent research endeavors;</li>
            <li>Non-TCU institutions providing research training to enable the successful transition of TCU students to major research universities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Roles of the Partner Agencies</strong></p>
          <p>All DEL proposals will be accepted and processed by means of either the NSF FastLane system or Grants.gov. All DEL proposals will receive ad hoc and then panel review within the NSF review process. Reviewers will be chosen jointly by NSF and NEH staff. Proposers will be asked to address, and reviewers asked to apply, the two NSF merit review criteria, Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.</p>
          <p>The estimated number of awards to be funded by NSF and NEH is 26 to 30. All the fellowships will be funded by NEH (5) and two to four senior research grants will also be funded and administered by NEH. Proposers of the projects identified for NEH funding will be instructed on how to submit documentation to NEH in order to process the award and their proposal will be withdrawn from FastLane by NSF. All other DEL awards will be funded and administered by NSF.</p>

        <h3> 
          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds. However, it is expected that approximately $4.5 million in funding will be available annually (approximately $3.5 million from NSF and up to $1 million from NEH).</p>
          <p>At least half of the available funding will be awarded to projects involving fieldwork.</p>
          <p>Funding will be available not only in the form of senior research standard and continuing grants, but also as fellowships and supplements which support both graduate and undergraduate research experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Award Size and Duration</strong></p>
          <p>Senior Research Projects: Approximately 12-25 Standard or Continuing Grants ranging from $12,000 to $150,000 per year for one to three years.</p>
          <p>Fellowships: Up to 5, $4,200 per month for awards lasting from six to twelve months; the maximum stipend is $50,400 for a twelve-month tenure period.</p>
          <p><strong>Special Fellowship Conditions</strong></p>
          <p>A Fellowship award of $4,200 per month will support a six-to twelve-month full-time individual tenure. The monthly stipend rate is fixed; no itemized budget is required. Proposers should request tenure periods that suit their schedules and the needs of their projects. A request for a shorter tenure period will not improve chances of receiving an award. The earliest that Fellows may begin their fellowship tenure is June 1 of the award year. The latest that Fellows may begin their fellowship tenure is 15 months later on September 1. Recipients must complete their fellowship tenure within two years of the beginning of the fellowship tenure. An award recipient must work full-time on the project and may not accept a teaching assignment or undertake any other major activity.</p>
          <p>Time devoted to the project may be divided into no more than two separate periods of no less than three months each.</p>
          <p>Fellowship proposals may be submitted not only by individuals but also by two persons working together on a single project. Both of them must be eligible to submit proposals for fellowships under this program solicitation; see Section IV of this solicitation for eligibility information. In dual proposals, both the unifying purpose of the project and contributions to be made by each proposer must be clear. Awards will not be made for parallel but unintegrated projects. All fellowships will be awarded to individuals, so two persons working together on a single project must each submit a separate proposal.</p>
          <p>Fellowships awarded under this program are not intended to support pre-Ph.D. course work or completion of a degree.</p>
          <p>All fellowships will be awarded and administered by the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>

        <p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
        <p>Collaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. Chapter II, Section D.5 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p>
        <p>See Chapter II.C.2 of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> for guidance on the required sections of a full research proposal submitted to NSF. Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following information supplements the GPG standard proposal preparation guidelines.</p>
        <p><strong>Proposal Preparation Instructions for DEL Senior Research Proposals and Fellowships </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong>  The Title of the proposed project should identify the specific language(s) it concerns by using the three-letter ISO codes, if possible. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/">http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/</a>.  Do not use more than three ISO codes.  The title should describe the project in a concise, informative way so that a scientifically or technically literate reader could understand what the project is about.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong>  The Summary of the proposed project should restate the Project Title, including the language code(s), and identify the most general family(ies) to which the specific language(s) belong. Also, indicate if the genetic affiliation of the language is in question. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://multitree.org/">http://multitree.org/</a>.</p>
        <p>The Project Summary must consist of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.  The overview should briefly describe the proposed project goals and objectives, and the research question or hypothesis to be addressed. In addition to the Data Management Plan required of all NSF proposal submissions, the Project Summary overview should also designate the location where the data will be archived. </p>
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong>  The Project Description must not exceed 15 pages. Included within this limit is a maximum of five pages detailing the results of work supported in the past five years by NSF or NEH, if any.  Also included should be brief sample materials (i.e., entries, records, or database results for specific queries) that illustrate the content and presentation of any final product.</p>
        <p>In general, the Project Description should indicate the work to be undertaken, the methodologies to be employed, the schedule according to which the work will be carried out, and the roles and qualifications of the project participants. The two NSF merit review criteria should be addressed explicitly and separately.</p>
        <p>In addressing the intellectual merit criterion, including the relevant considerations in Section VI.A. (below), discuss also the degree of endangerment of the language(s) to be documented and the urgency of the need for documentation. Describe the level, quality, and accessibility of any existing documentation of the language(s). Discuss any special linguistic, historical, cognitive, cultural, or social significance of the language(s).</p>
        <p>The Project Description should discuss plans for archiving recordings, field notes, and processed documentary materials in a stable environment. Simply placing materials on a CD or a Website will not in and of itself guarantee sustainable archiving. In discussing methods to be employed in recording, documenting, and archiving the endangered language(s), include reference to current statements of best practices.  Discuss aspects of the project that will ensure interoperability with related materials.</p>
        <p>In addressing the broader impacts criterion, including the relevant considerations in Section VI. A. (below), also discuss collaboration and other arrangements made with the speaker community. Discussion may include reference to the training of native speakers in the practice of linguistics and to the production of resources useful to the community of native speakers.</p>
        <p>Discuss any intellectual property issues that might affect the availability of the materials.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Information and Supplementary Documentation</strong></p>
        <p>Data Management Plan (DMP):  All proposals must include as a supplementary document a plan for data management and sharing the products of research. The data management plan to be submitted with a proposal must be no longer than two (2) pages in length and must be included as a supplementary document. </p>
        <p>A summary of the solicitation-specific DMP requirements are 1) the archiving location should appear in the Project Summary; 2) plans and methodology for the sustainable, long-term archiving of all data and a discussion of interoperability with related materials should appear in the Project Description; 3) PIs and Co-PIs with prior awards funded by either or both NSF and NEH should report on data management under "Results of prior NSF support" in accordance with the Data Management Plan for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards  4) budgeted costs for archiving, including the ingestion into the archive, should appear in the Budget and Budget Justification under Other Direct Costs line G6; 5) a letter from the archive selected by the project should appear in Supplementary Documents; and 6) the Data Management Plan should appear in Supplementary Documents. The SBE Data Management Plan for SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards includes information relevant to reporting and is located at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/SBE_DataMgmtPlanPolicy.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/SBE_DataMgmtPlanPolicy.pdf</a>.</p>
        <p>In preparing their DMP, applicants should address all five of the points specified in Chapter II, Section C.2.j of the Grant Proposal Guide and the comparable section of the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.  </p>
        <p>The DMP should provide evidence that the applicant has contacted a trusted repository to arrange for long-term archiving of documentation generated by the DEL project.  The language archive selected by a DEL project must have a long-term institutional commitment to data preservation and access.  While the DEL Program does not sponsor or have an official arrangement with any language archive, these services are provided by DELAMAN member archives (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.delaman.org/">http://www.delaman.org</a>) and by institutions holding the Data Seal of Approval (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/">http://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/</a>). Regular data backup should be an integral part of the DMP, but this is not to be equated with archiving in a trusted repository. Backing up data on hard drives, servers, optical media, and cloud based services does not constitute archiving.</p>
        <p>The DMP should include a time-line for completion of archiving activities. It is expected that archiving should be completed prior to the submission of the final project report. </p>
        <p>Applicants should include a letter of support from the archive indicating their willingness to archive project materials and outlining any specific arrangements which have been made.  This statement must be uploaded under &ldquo;Other Supplementary Documents&rdquo;. </p>
        <p>Language documentation is of little value if it cannot be accessed. To that extent the DEL Program expects that the vast majority of data generated by the DEL project will be publically accessible with minimal restrictions for non-commercial, educational purposes. (Restrictions on commercial use are acceptable.) The DMP should indicate how archived materials will be accessible to the public. Any restrictions to be placed on access should be clearly indicated.  If the applicant expects access to some materials to be restricted to certain user groups, the DMP should indicate the criteria delineating such user groups and provide an estimate of the percentage of materials which will be so restricted. If time limits are to be placed on access to materials, the DMP should indicate the period of time after which access restrictions will be removed. </p>
        <p>Statement of Consultation:  Include an explicit statement that care has been taken to consult with the relevant parties in the speech communities where the research is to be conducted.  The PI should ensure that appropriate permissions for the proposed research have been requested.  This statement must be uploaded under &ldquo;Other Supplementary Documents&rdquo;. </p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In addition to the above documents, a file with up to two pages of examples of interlinear glossing, dictionary format, questionnaires, task protocols, etc. may also be included under "Other Supplementary Documents". </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
     
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
           <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
       
        <p>Reviewers will take into account how well the additional DEL specifics listed below were addressed in the proposal.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Discussion on the degree of endangerment of the languages(s) to be documented and the urgency of the need for documentation</li>
          <li>Description of the level, quality, and accessibility of any existing documentation of the language(s)</li>
          <li>Discussion on any special linguistic, historical, cognitive, cultural, or social significance of the language(s)</li>
          <li>Discussion on collaborations and other arrangements made with the speaker community which may include reference to the training of native speakers in the practice of linguistics and to the production of resources useful to the community of native speakers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>NSF will coordinate and manage the review of proposals in consultation with NEH. Copies of proposals and unattributed reviews will be shared with NEH, as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism.

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
