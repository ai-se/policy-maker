<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div><p>America today faces more challenges from more varied sources than at any time in the recent past. From the rise of new powers to ethnic strife, disease, and poverty, from climate change to failed and failing states and the rise of violent extremism, the United States will increasingly be forced to grapple with unprecedented social change. To address these challenges, Americans and their government need a better understanding of the factors and causes behind these changes, what they might mean for the U.S., and what the future might bring. The Department of Defense&rsquo;s Minerva Initiative is intended to help develop that understanding. By drawing upon the knowledge, ideas, and creativity of the nation&rsquo;s universities, NSF and DoD aim to foster a new generation of engaged scholarship in the social and behavioral sciences that seeks to meet the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Defense (DoD) are initiating a university-based social and behavioral science research activity, as part of The Minerva Initiative launched by the Secretary of Defense, that focuses on areas of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy.&nbsp; NSF and DoD intend: 1) to develop the DoD&rsquo;s social and human science intellectual capital in order to enhance its ability to address future challenges; 2) to enhance the DoD&rsquo;s engagement with the social science community; and 3) to deepen the understanding of the social and behavioral dimensions of national security issues. In pursuit of these objectives, NSF and DoD will bring together universities, research institutions, and individual scholars and will support disciplinary, interdisciplinary and collaborative projects addressing areas of strategic importance to national security policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve the Secretary&rsquo;s vision, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSDP) will pilot a number of approaches for engaging the social science community.&nbsp; This multi-pronged strategy will enable the Department to solicit a broad range of proposals from the social and behavioral science communities and to leverage the expertise and infrastructures of a wide range of existing mechanisms for funding basic research. This NSF Solicitation represents one of those approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The competition will produce a variety of outcomes which may include new programs of research, scholarly papers, conferences, publications, and research and data archives.&nbsp; All work funded through this solicitation will be unclassified. There will be no constraints on researchers' freedom to publish their results.</p>
</div>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div>
<p>Under the broad category of defense-relevant social and behavioral science research, specific topics to be considered are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>New Approaches to Understanding Dimensions of National Security, Conflict, and Cooperation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Successful applicants will develop new theories and models that address the security challenges of the 21st century. NSF-DoD are supporting innovative research that explores the security implications of findings in social and human science disciplines such as anthropology, demography, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology, and that makes use of a variety of interdisciplinary methods, such as systems and network analyses and evolutionary modeling.</p>
<p>Some examples of appropriate work in this area might include: exploring the impact on defense of changing concepts of national and individual security within an increasingly globalized and economically interdependent international system; considering how far the nature, means, and objectives of conflict may change within such a global system; examining the impact of quasi-governmental institutions on internal and international conflict; identifying the risks and opportunities for peace and security that are suggested by growing physical resource, demographic, and environmental pressures and the mechanisms available to address them; exploring the factors that influence conflict and conflict resolution between individuals, groups, organizations, and/or nations in the presence of these pressures; understanding the role of future societal change in shaping defense activities and capabilities; and determining the relationship between security, military capability, and national and international economic prosperity in the 21st century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Studies of Terrorist Organization and Ideologies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Successful applicants will examine the relationship of the structure, processes, and dynamics of terrorist organizations and ideologies to political and social conflict. Areas of particular interest include, but are not limited to: the interaction between political dynamics on the ground and terrorist goals and ideologies; the psychological, social, cultural, economic, political, and community factors that impact the choice to actively participate in or passively support international and/or national terrorist organizations; the role of internal and external security forces in suppressing terrorism; the role of new media technologies in terrorist recruitment, radicalization, and de-radicalization; the spread of ideologies across culturally diverse populations.&nbsp; When appropriate, use of original-language source materials is strongly preferred, but not essential.&nbsp; Innovative interdisciplinary approaches are particularly desirable.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Studies of the Strategic Impact of Religious and Cultural Change</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Successful applicants will explore the political and strategic impact of religious and cultural trends around the world. Though the impact of these changes in the Islamic world is of obvious current interest, all regions of the globe are open for inquiry.&nbsp; Both historical and contemporary projects will be considered.&nbsp; In either case, successful projects must be able to explain the relevance of findings to contemporary political and strategic contexts.&nbsp; Subject areas of particular interest include, but are not limited to: the relationship between religious ideologies and the behavior of sub-state actors bound by ethnic, tribal, and regional identities; the impact of religious and cultural identities on intragroup and intergroup political and strategic dynamics; transnational networks of religious thinkers and authorities; debates between religious extremists and their political competitors, religious and non-religious alike; and the interplay between religious and non-religious forms of identity.&nbsp; When appropriate, use of original-language source materials is strongly preferred, but not essential.&nbsp; Preference will be given to studies that combine academic expertise in religious and area studies with other relevant human science disciplines.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Studies of Political, Cultural, and Social Dynamics Under Authoritarian Regimes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Successful applicants will explore the social, political, and cultural dynamics of authoritarian regimes and what changes are wrought by transitions to and from dictatorial rule. Research that explores these dynamics under the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq is particularly encouraged but projects concerning other authoritarian regimes will also be considered.&nbsp; Examples of issue areas of interest include, but are not limited to: studies of leadership dynamics; the role of national and social identity in building or undermining political unity; the ability of governments to provide public goods as nations transition from authoritarian rule; the role of foreign governments and non-government organizations on political transitions; and popular perceptions of international actors and relations.&nbsp; When appropriate, use of original-language source materials is strongly preferred, but not essential. Preference will be given to innovative interdisciplinary projects that bring insights from the behavioral and social sciences. Successful candidates must be capable of explaining the contemporary political and strategic relevance of their findings.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF SUPPORT:</strong>&nbsp;
<p>Standard awards will be made. Subject to availability of funds, projects funded under this solicitation will support research activities of the following types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Workshops (NSCC/W):&nbsp; </strong>Up to an all inclusive total of $50,000 to $150,000, for a duration of one year.</li>
    <li><strong>Small Award Grants (NSCC/SA): </strong> Up to an all inclusive total of $500,000, over a duration of two to three years.</li>
    <li><strong>Large Award Grants (NSCC/LA):</strong>&nbsp; Up to an all inclusive total of $2 million per year for a duration of three to five years.</li>
</ul></div>

</ul><h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a></h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Internal NSF Review, or for Large Awards (NSCC/LA), site vists and reverse site visits may also be required.</span></p>
<p>
<span>All proposals will be reviewed using the two NSB general review criteria.&nbsp; In addition, they will be judged on the basis of their responsiveness to the goals and criteria established for this joint NSF-DoD activity as specified in the program solicitation. Because proposals requesting consideration as &quot;large awards&quot; involve complex efforts from teams that are likely to be interdisciplinary, the relative effectiveness of their management plans also will be considered.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p></p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.
<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
</p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p><p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
