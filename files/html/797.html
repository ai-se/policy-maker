        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
      </strong></div>
      <p><strong>FAQ #1. Changes in the MRI Program and Solicitation</strong></p>
      <p><strong>1.A. Question:</strong> How does the new FY 2004 MRI Program Solicitation differ
        from the previous FY 2003 MRI Program Solicitation?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The new MRI Program Solicitation has been revised in several
        ways: Changes have been made in the classification of eligible institutions,
        NSF&#8217;s revised cost sharing policy, and the conformity of the program
        with recently instituted Foundation-wide policies. Highlights of the
        changes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New requirements as specified in the revised NSF Grant Proposal
        Guide <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a></li>
        <li> New deadline date for proposals: Thursday, January 22, 2004</li>
        <li>Revised
          language to clarify:
          <ul>
            <li> Eligible institution classification &#8211; from two types of
              institutions in previous fiscal years to three classifications
              in FY 2004: non-Ph.D.
            granting, Ph.D. granting, and non-degree granting institutions</li>
            <li>Cost
              sharing policy &#8211; in conformance with NSF&#8217;s revised
              cost sharing policy, proposers may provide no more and no less
            than the stipulated cost sharing level</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Changes in the requirements of the Supplementary Documents section of
          the FastLane proposal:
          <ul>
            <li>Except for instrument development proposals, letters of commitment
            are neither required nor allowed
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Letter(s) of agreement from
                    private sector partner(s) describing the role of the private
                    sector partner in the development effort should only
        be submitted in conjunction with development proposals </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> 	<em>Certification of Institutional Classification</em> document
                    is required &#8211; officially
                              states the institutional classification: non-Ph.D.
            granting, Ph.D. granting, or non-degree granting</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>      <p><strong>FAQ #2. Eligible Institutions</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2.A. Question:</strong> What is the difference between non-Ph.D. granting institutions,
        Ph.D. granting institutions, and non-degree granting institutions? </p>
      <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Per the MRI solicitation, Ph.D. granting institutions are academic
        institutions that have produced more than 20 Ph.D.&#8217;s or D.Sci.&#8217;s
        in all NSF-supported disciplines (NSF is the only federal agency responsible
        for advancing research and education across all disciplines of science
        and engineering &#8211; please review NSF&#8217;s Guide to Programs for
        supported disciplines <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/publicat/nsf03009/start.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/publicat/nsf03009/start.htm</a>)
        during the previous two academic years. Non-Ph.D. granting institutions
        are two- and four-year colleges and universities that have produced fewer
        than 20 Ph.D.&#8217;s or D.Sci.&#8217;s in all NSF-supported disciplines
        during the previous two academic years. Non-degree granting institutions
        are independent nonprofit research institutions, research museums, and
        legally recognized consortia. Please see FAQ #6 for cost sharing requirements
        for each eligible institution category.</p>
      <p><strong>2.B. Question:</strong> What type of documentation is needed to convey to NSF
        my institution&#8217;s type/classification? Where in the proposal should
        this documentation be included?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Beginning with the FY 2004 MRI competition, institutions must
        upload a <em>Certification of Institutional Classification</em> document into
        the Supplementary Documents section of their FastLane proposal. Please
        bear in mind that these classifications are mutually exclusive. This
        document must indicate the name of the institution, the type of institution
        (non-Ph.D. granting, Ph.D. granting or non-degree granting) and must
        be signed by an Authorized Institutional Representative. Below is a sample
        of a <em>Certification of Institutional Classification document.</em></p>
      <p>        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Sample Certification of Institutional Classification</p>      <p><em>&#8220;By
          submission of this proposal, the institution hereby certifies that
          the originating and managing institution is a <strong>[non-Ph.D. granting,
        Ph.D. granting, or non-degree granting] </strong>institution per the respective
        definitions in the MRI program solicitation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04511">NSF
        04-511</a>).&#8221;</em></p>
      <p>Authorized Institutional Representative<br>

      <p>      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>      <strong>2.C. Question:</strong> I understand that institutions may no longer submit proposals
        to the MRI competition as Research Undergraduate Institutions (RUI).
        If I submitted as an RUI in past MRI competitions, what is my institutional
        classification for the FY 2004 MRI competition?</p>      <p><strong>Answer: </strong>A RUI should submit as a non-Ph.D. granting institution. Unlike
        past MRI competitions, RUIs should not put &#8220;RUI&#8221; in the proposal&#8217;s
        title, should not provide a RUI impact statement, and should not include
        a RUI certification of eligibility document.</p>
      <p><strong>FAQ #3. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3.A. Question:</strong> Where should I address NSF&#8217;s merit review criteria &#8211; intellectual
        merit and broader impacts?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Per NSF&#8217;s Grant Proposal Guide (under
        Chapter II C.2.b. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf042/2.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf042/2.htm</a>), the proposal
        should &#8220;clearly
        address in separate statements (within the one-page summary): (1) the
        intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (2) the broader impacts
        of the proposed activity&#8230; Proposals that do not separately address
        both merit review criteria within the one page Project Summary will be
        returned without review.&#8221; The merit review criteria should be addressed
        more thoroughly in the project description.</p>
      <p>Please also read the additional review criteria for the MRI program
        located in Section VI of the MRI solicitation.</p>
      <p>        <strong>FAQ #4. Proposal Content</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4.A. Question:</strong> In past MRI competitions, we were instructed to submit
        letters of support/commitment/agreement within the supplementary documents
        section of our proposal. Is this still the case?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The only instance where a letter of agreement should be uploaded
        into the supplementary documents section is for development proposals.
        Letter(s) of agreement from private sector partner(s) describing the
        role of the private sector partner in the development effort should only
        be submitted in conjunction with development proposals. No other letters
        of support/commitment should be included in any section of the proposal. </p>
      <p><strong>FAQ #5. Development proposals</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5.A. Question:</strong> What types of proposals are appropriate for the instrument
        development category?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The instrument development proposals target the next generation
        of research instrumentation. The proposed instrument should be unique
        and have enhanced capabilities (e.g. accuracy; reliability; resolving
        power; throughput speed; sample capacity; flexibility of operation; breadth
        of application; and user-friendliness). It is expected that at the end
        of the grant period (up to five years), there will be a working version
        of the instrument and that results of the completed work will be broadly
        disseminated. In cases where appropriate, instrument development may
        include transfer of technology to the U.S. industrial and governmental
        laboratories.</p>
      <p><strong>5.B. Question:</strong> What issues should be addressed in instrument development
        proposals?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The proposal should contain a specific plan for instrument development
        and an explanation of how the research conducted with the requested instrument
        will advance knowledge and understanding in the relevant scientific field.
        The proposal should also include prior work of the investigators indicating
        that the instrumentation will be successfully developed and utilized. </p>
      <p><strong>FAQ #6. Cost Sharing</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6.A. Question:</strong> What are the cost sharing requirements for the three
        categories of eligible institutions: non-Ph.D. granting institution,
        Ph.D. granting institutions and non-degree granting institutions?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Non-Ph.D. granting institutions are not required nor allowed
        to provide cost sharing. For instrument acquisition proposals, Ph.D.
        granting and non-degree granting institutions are required to provide
        no more and no less than 30% cost sharing of the total project cost.
        (The total project cost is the sum of <strong>Line L </strong>and <strong>Line
        M</strong> on the FastLane
        budget). For instrument development proposals, Ph.D. granting and non-degree
        granting institutions are required to provide no more and no less than
        30% cost sharing of the total equipment hardware cost. (The total equipment
        hardware cost is <strong>Line D</strong> of your FastLane budget). </p>
      <p><strong>6.B. Question:</strong> What happens if a non-Ph.D. granting institution is willing
        to provide cost sharing even though it is not required? Likewise, what
        happens if a Ph.D. granting institution or a non-degree granting institution
        is willing to provide more than the 30% of total project cost for acquisition
        proposals/30% of equipment hardware cost for development proposals? </p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Per NSF Important Notice 128 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in128.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in128.pdf</a>), &#8220;proposers
        should not exceed the cost sharing level or amount specified in the solicitation.&#8221; Therefore,
        non-Ph.D. granting institutions are not required nor allowed to provide
        cost sharing. Also, Ph.D. granting institutions and non-degree granting
        institutions should provide no more or no less than the stipulated cost
        sharing requirements for acquisition proposals and development proposals.
        Proposals that provide more than or less than the stipulated cost sharing
        requirement are subject to return by the NSF even if the proposal is
        recommended for award during the review process.</p>
      <p><strong>6.C. Question:</strong> Will the FastLane budget automatically calculate the
        required cost sharing amount?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. The proposer manually inserts the cost sharing amount on
        <strong>Line M</strong> (cost sharing proposed level) of the FastLane budget. For Ph.D.
        granting institutions and non-degree granting institutions, this amount
        should reflect exactly 30% of the total project cost for acquisition
        proposals and exactly 30% of the total equipment hardware cost (<strong>Line
        D</strong>) for development proposals. Please keep in mind that all entries in
        the column titled, &quot;Funds Requested By Proposer,&quot; on the proposal
        budget should reflect only those costs that you are requesting from NSF.        <strong>Line
        L</strong> should reflect the total amount that you are requesting from NSF. On
        your FastLane budget, <strong>Line M</strong> should <strong>never</strong> be equivalent to 30% of <strong>Line
      L</strong>. </p>
