These questions and answers are intended for  guidance only.&nbsp; The document that defines  proposal requirements is the solicitation.
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><a href="#witgi">What is the general intent       of the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> program?</a></li>
<li><a href="#wsada">When selecting and       describing a project, how important is the impact on research and research       training?</a></li>
<li><a href="#iiagi">Is it a good idea to roll       up several renovations into one proposal?</a></li>
<li><a href="#ciptr">Can I propose the       renovation of an existing facility that is not used for research in order       to create a new research facility?</a></li>
<li><a href="#dtngc">Do the NSF grant       conditions explicitly require awardees to comply with the Americans with       Disabilities Act (ADA)?&nbsp; </a></li>
<li><a href="#witio">What is the impact       of Executive Order 11246 likely to be on the recipients of ARI-R<sup>2</sup>       awards?</a></li>
<li><a href="#wwltr">We would like to       renovate a research facility that is used for research in the social and       economic sciences.&nbsp; Is this eligible       for the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> program? </a></li>
<li><a href="#apoop">As part of our proposed       renovation, we will need to knock a hole in the floor. Our physical plant people       can do it, but they are employed by the university, and my assumption is       that their salaries would not be an allowable cost.&nbsp; Would it be acceptable to engage an       outside contractor to do the work? </a></li>
<li><a href="#hatiw">Here are three ideas we       are considering for a facility renovation proposal, can you help us choose       between them?</a></li>
<li><a href="#wwbta">What will be the average       award size? </a></li>
<li><a href="#wahde">We are having difficulty       entering the proposal into FastLane.&nbsp;       Who should we contact for help?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a></li>
<li><a href="#dywpf">Do you welcome       proposals from community colleges, and do you have any examples of       proposals that we could take a look at? </a></li>
<li><a href="#wauws">We are unfamiliar       with some of the Project Management terminology used in the       solicitation.&nbsp; Are there some       reference materials we could look at? </a></li>
<li><a href="#tsatt">The solicitation asks that       the Project Manager&rsquo;s biographical sketch be included in the Biographical       Sketches section of the proposal.&nbsp;       The Grant Proposal Guide&rsquo;s description of a biographical sketch       seems most appropriate for an individual who is a researcher.&nbsp; If the Project Manager is not a researcher,       how should the biographical sketch be completed?</a></li>
<li><a href="#wftiw">We feel that it would be       most appropriate to list all of our department faculty members as senior       personnel.&nbsp; Do they all have to       describe the results of prior research support in the Project Description?&nbsp; Must they all complete the Current and       Pending Support section of the proposal?</a></li>
<li><a href="#tppii">The proposal preparation instructions in the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> solicitation state that the Supplementary Documents section       should include, &ldquo;One set of page-size schematic drawings showing existing       conditions and work to be done. Drawings must be an integral part of the       proposal package and should be as extensive as possible. These drawings       should show appropriate details of existing conditions and proposed work.&rdquo;&nbsp; What level of detail is required in       these drawings? Must they be professionally prepared architectural       drawings?</a></li>
<li><a href="#wwtpa">We wish to propose a       renovation that consists of converting office space into research       laboratory space.&nbsp; The office space       is currently used by research students and post-docs for activities such as       computations, simulations, data analysis and the writing of research       articles.&nbsp; Is this consistent with       the solicitation.</a></li>
<li><a href="#oihai">Our institution has an       in-house facility design and construction department.&nbsp; Its staff       members are university employees.&nbsp;       We intend to have them assume the lead role in the planning and       construction management of our proposed project.&nbsp; This unit typically       functions on a recharge basis.&nbsp; Can       the services of the people in this unit be billed to the NSF-funded       portion of the project budget?</a></li>

<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="witgi" id="witgi"></a>What is the general intent of the ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  program?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The intent of this program is to provide one-time assistance  in modernizing the Nation's <strong>existing</strong> shared research facilities where  sponsored and/or unsponsored research activities and research training take  place.&nbsp; An ideal candidate for an ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  project would be an existing research or research training facility that has  become dilapidated or partially obsolete so that it cannot effectively support  the needs of modern research in the area for which the facility was intended,  but which, if repaired and/or renovated, would go on to serve the needs of  modern researchers or provide training in modern research, greatly expanding  the impact of the facility in its associated area of research and research  training. </p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to comment on the likely impact of  the proposed repair or renovation in the context of the institution submitting  the proposal. </p>
<p>While new research facilities are important for the research  enterprise, the scope of the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> solicitation is limited to the  improvement of existing research facilities or research training  facilities.&nbsp; The ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  program is not intended to support the creation of new facilities for research  or research training.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="wsada" id="wsada"></a>When selecting and describing a project,  how important is the impact on research and research training?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Very important.&nbsp; As  described in the preceding FAQ, the core purpose of the ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  program is the improvement of existing research and research training  facilities so that the Nation&rsquo;s academic and independent non-profit research  organizations are better able to advance the boundaries of discovery and  innovation.&nbsp; Reviewers are ask to examine  and comment upon, &ldquo;The adequacy and appropriateness of the existing facility  for current and expected research and research training activities,&rdquo; and the,  &ldquo;Demonstrated need for improvement of the facility based on analysis of current  condition and potential impact.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a proposal to be successful, it is essential that it  describe the current research or research training performed at the facility,  the current condition of that facility, the proposed improvements, and the  impact that these improvements will have on the future research or research  training that will be carried out at the facility.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="iiagi" id="iiagi"></a>Is it a good idea to roll up several  renovations of multiple facilities into one proposal?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In  general, no.&nbsp; The solicitation is written  in terms of a single research facility per proposal while retaining some  flexibility about what constitutes a research facility.&nbsp; The intent is that an ARI-R<sup>2</sup> award  should support the improvement of something that makes sense as a coherent  research facility.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposals will  be reviewed by a group of external reviewers who will first read the  solicitation and make their assessments in the context of the wording of the solicitation.&nbsp; If you feel that you can make a strong case  in a proposal that infrastructure in separate locations constitutes a single  research facility, and you feel that reviewers and program officers are likely  to find this convincing, then you are free to propose an improvement of this  facility.&nbsp; However, you should be careful  to avoid creating the perception that your proposal is an attempt to get around  the one-proposal-per-institution limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="ciptr" id="ciptr"></a>Can I propose the renovation of an existing  facility that is not used for research in order to create a new research  facility?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="dtngc" id="dtngc"></a>Do the NSF grant conditions explicitly  require awardees to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nondiscrimination section of NSF&rsquo;s General Grant  Conditions <br />
(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp</a>)  subjects any award to the provisions of several civil rights statutes,  including the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis  of handicap by the Federal government, Federal contractors, and recipients of  Federal financial assistance.&nbsp; If you receive an ARI-R<sup>2</sup> award  (or a typical NSF research award), you will fall into the category of a  recipient of Federal financial assistance.&nbsp; The Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) is, in fact, based on section 504 of the Rehabilitation  Act and its implementing regulations.&nbsp; The obligation to comply with the  Rehabilitation Act&nbsp;also applies to subrecipients, subgrantees, and subcontractors  under the award.&nbsp; Thus, all renovations/repairs completed in connection  with an ARI-R<sup>2</sup> award must be compliant with the Rehabilitation  Act.&nbsp; Although the&nbsp;requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and the  ADA&nbsp;are quite similar, there may be slight differences.&nbsp; In addition,  it is likely that your institution will have an independent obligation under  the law to comply with&nbsp;the ADA.&nbsp; You will need to ask your  institution&rsquo;s counsel for guidance on whether the ADA applies to your  institution and for the interpretation of what compliance with the  Rehabilitation Act, the ADA and associated regulations might entail in the  particular circumstance of your institution and the project you intend to  propose.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="41" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="witio" id="witio"></a>What  is the impact of Executive Order 11246 likely to be on the recipients of ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  awards?</strong>&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Executive  Order 11246 and Department of Labor regulations implementing the Order are  directed at government contracts, including construction contracts that are  Federally assisted.&nbsp; An academic institution that is the recipient of an  ARI-R<sup>2</sup> award should not fall within the scope of most of the order  because the funding mechanism used in connection with the ARI solicitation is a  Federal assistance grant, not a contract.&nbsp; Thus, such an institution will  not be a contractor with NSF and, except in its relations with construction  contractors, will not have to implement any parts of the order that go beyond  existing statutes that might apply to the institution.&nbsp; The institution  will, however,&nbsp;be required to incorporate the provisions set forth in  section 202 of the Executive Order, as well as any additional provisions  established by the Department of Labor in its implementing regulations, into  all construction contracts (and subcontracts) paid for in whole or in part by  Federal funds.&nbsp; Thus, any contractors and subcontractors doing  construction work in connection with an ARI-R<sup>2</sup> award will be subject  to the requirements of the Executive Order and the implementing regulations,  unless they are otherwise exempt.&nbsp; You will need to ask your own  institution&rsquo;s counsel for guidance on exactly what the Executive Order and  associated Department of Labor regulations mean for your particular  circumstances. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="42" type="1">
<li><a name="wwltr" id="wwltr"></a><strong>We  would like to renovate a research facility that is used for research in the  social and economic sciences.&nbsp; Is this  eligible for the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> program</strong>?&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Proposals can be submitted for the renovation  of any area of research that is typically supported by NSF, whether or not the  research at the facility in question is directly funded by NSF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Research in the social, economic and  behavioral sciences is supported by the NSF.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="43" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="apoop" id="apoop"></a>As part of our proposed renovation, we will  need to knock a hole in the floor. Our physical plant people can do it, but  they are employed by the university, and my assumption is that their salaries  would not be an allowable cost.&nbsp; Would it  be acceptable to engage an outside contractor to do the work?&nbsp; </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The  solicitation precludes awardees from including salary and related costs of  their employees in proposal budgets.&nbsp; It  is acceptable, though not required, to engage an outside contractor to do the  work.&nbsp; In this event, please be aware of  the answer to FAQ #41.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="44" type="1">
<li><a name="hatiw" id="hatiw"></a><strong>Here are three ideas we are considering for  a facility renovation proposal, can you help us choose between them?</strong> </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, NSF staff cannot provide feedback on the merits of ideas  that you may be considering for proposals.&nbsp;  One strategy you might adopt is to put yourself in the place of a  reviewer, read the review criteria given in the solicitation, and see which of  your ideas you would find the most compelling &ndash; e.g., in terms of the highest  impact on the capabilities of the college for research and research training,  in terms of feasibility, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="45" type="1">
<li><a name="wwbta" id="wwbta"></a><strong>What will be the average award size? </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The solicitation explains that we anticipate funding approximately 100  proposals in the range $250,000 - $2,000,000, 6-10 in the range $2M - $5M and  3-5 in the range $5M - $10M.&nbsp; The solicitation also states that the total  available funding is $200M.</p>

<li><strong><a name="wahde" id="wahde"></a>We are having difficulty entering the  proposal into FastLane.&nbsp; Who should we  contact for help?</strong>&nbsp; <strong></strong></li>

<li><a name="dywpf" id="dywpf"></a><strong>Do  you welcome proposals from community colleges, and do you have any examples of  proposals that we could take a look at?</strong>&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The  ARI-R<sup>2</sup> program welcomes proposals from community colleges and is  interested in outcomes that strengthen the opportunities for students at  community colleges to conduct independent research under the mentorship of  faculty members or of scientists and engineers in the surrounding  community.&nbsp; The solicitation calls for  proposals for the repair or renovation of an <strong>existing</strong> facility used for research or research  training.&nbsp; Provided that you have such a facility at the moment, then you  are welcome to propose a renovation of that facility that improves its ability  to support research or research training.&nbsp; New construction cannot be  included so the renovation cannot include building a new wing or annex, but  many other types of major renovations or repairs are possible.<br />
If you have not yet had a chance to look at them, you may  find helpful the original set of FAQs for ARI-R<sup>2</sup> (see the link near  the bottom of the program web-page at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/ari">www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/ari</a>)  and the recording of a webinar about the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> and MRI-R<sup>2</sup>  programs (accessible through another link on the program webpage).&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with submitting proposals to NSF, you  may find the following helpful.</p>
<p>First, if you are not already familiar with FastLane, you  will need to have your college's grants office set up&nbsp;a FastLane ID for  you as an authorized Principal Investigator for the college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Submission of a proposal is a two-stage process.&nbsp;  Usually the Principal Investigator (PI) prepares the proposal in  FastLane.&nbsp; When it is ready, she or he&nbsp;presses the button that  forwards the proposal to the college's sponsored program office (SPO).&nbsp;&nbsp;The  SPO must then submit it electronically to NSF via FastLane by 5pm on the day of  the deadline.&nbsp; You should talk with your SPO in advance to make sure you  and the SPO are coordinated.&nbsp; A mistake  that occasionally occurs is for the PI to complete the proposal, but for the SPO  to fail to submit it.</p>
<p>If you have not used FastLane before, it may be useful to  visit <a href="http://www.fldemo.nsf.gov" title="http://www.fldemo.nsf.gov">www.fldemo.nsf.gov</a> (a demonstration, not  the real FastLane site) and play around with it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are no publicly available examples of full  proposals&nbsp;that are specific to the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> program, but you  might get a flavor of what is expected by looking at some materials prepared by  people around NSF, available at the following&nbsp;links. &nbsp;(Note that&nbsp;these contain some advice  specific to particular programs that are different to ARI-R<sup>2</sup> so  don't take them too literally.&nbsp; In particular, ARI-R<sup>2</sup> proposals  need some very specific sections and additional documents that are not usually  found in research proposals.)</p>

<p>You should also read the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) if you  haven't already done so.&nbsp; (Note that the ARI-R<sup>2</sup> solicitation  modifies some of the requirements given in the GPG and adds some others so keep  the solicitation in mind as this takes precedence over the GPG.)&nbsp; The GPG may be viewed at: <br />

<li><a name="wauws" id="wauws"></a><strong>We  are unfamiliar with some of the Project Management terminology used in the  solicitation.&nbsp; Are there some reference  materials we could look at?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Pointers to various  reference materials may be found at the website of the Project Management  Institute (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.pmi.org">www.pmi.org</a>).&nbsp; An online glossary of project  management terms may be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.maxwideman.com/pmglossary/">http://www.maxwideman.com/pmglossary/</a>.&nbsp; And for those who like the introductions in  the &ldquo;Complete Idiot&rsquo;s Guide&rdquo; series, there is a volume on Project Management.</p>

<li><a name="tsatt" id="tsatt"></a><strong>The solicitation asks that the Project  Manager&rsquo;s biographical sketch be included in the Biographical Sketches section  of the proposal.&nbsp; The Grant Proposal Guide&rsquo;s  description of a biographical sketch seems most appropriate for an individual  who is a researcher.&nbsp; If the Project  Manager is not a researcher, how should the biographical sketch be completed?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The  Project Manager&rsquo;s Biographical Sketch should convey her or his qualifications  and experience.&nbsp; The document should clearly identify that the individual  will be the Project Manager (PM) and list the PM&rsquo;s professional training and  professional appointments as described in the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG).&nbsp; It may go on to briefly describe the PM&rsquo;s  previous experience in project management.&nbsp;  It must conclude with a section on Collaborators and Other Affiliations,  as described in the GPG.&nbsp; The Project  Manager&rsquo;s Biographical Sketch should be no more than two pages in length and  conform to the basic format requirements described in Chapter II, Section B of  the GPG: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_29/gpg_2.jsp#IIB">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_29/gpg_2.jsp#IIB</a></p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It is  unlikely to be necessary or helpful to list all of the department&rsquo;s faculty  members as senior personnel.&nbsp; If the  intent is to describe the range of investigators who will use the research or  research training facility, this should be done in the Project  Description.&nbsp; If the success of the  proposed project requires a commitment of time from an individual who belongs  to one of the categories of senior personnel described in the Grant Proposal  Guide, then it would be appropriate to list that individual.</p>
<p> The  inclusion, in the Project Description, of Results from Prior NSF Support is  required only for the PI and co-PIs and only if that individual has received  NSF funding in the past five years.&nbsp; Each  PI and co-PI who has received <em>more than one award</em> (excluding amendments)  should report only on the award most closely related to the proposal.&nbsp; Details of what should be reported are given  in the Grant Proposal Guide: <br />
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_29/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2d">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_29/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2d</a></p>
<p> The  Grant Proposal Guide states that Current and Pending Support must be reported  for <strong>the PI and all other senior personnel</strong> involved in the project.&nbsp; Information is required, &ldquo;on all current and  pending support for ongoing projects and proposals, including subsequent  funding in the case of continuing grants. All current project support from  whatever source (e.g., Federal, State, local or foreign government agencies,  public or private foundations, industrial or other commercial organizations)  must be listed. The proposed project and all other projects or activities  requiring a portion of time of the PI and other senior personnel must be  included, even if they receive no salary support from the project(s). The total  award amount for the entire award period covered (including indirect costs)  must be shown as well as the number of person-months per year to be devoted to  the project, regardless of source of support. Similar information must be  provided for all proposals already submitted or submitted concurrently to other  possible sponsors, including NSF.&rdquo;</p>

<li><strong><a name="tppii" id="tppii"></a>The proposal preparation instructions in the ARI-R<sup>2</sup>  solicitation state that the Supplementary Documents section should include,  &ldquo;One set of page-size schematic drawings showing existing conditions and work  to be done. Drawings must be an integral part of the proposal package and  should be as extensive as possible. These drawings should show appropriate  details of existing conditions and proposed work.&rdquo;&nbsp; What level of detail is required in these  drawings? Must they be professionally prepared architectural drawings? </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>There  are no specific requirements on the level of detail in the drawings.&nbsp; It is anticipated that different groups will  be at different stages in planning and will submit drawings appropriate to that  stage.&nbsp; The important thing is for the  reviewers to be able to understand clearly what you want to do, to evaluate the  likely accuracy of your cost estimates, to assess risk, and to be able to judge  the impact of the proposed renovation.</p>

<p>We  really cannot make such a determination before a proposal is submitted.&nbsp; We anticipate that we will ask the reviewers  for their advice on whether&nbsp;such a system&nbsp;is needed in order to  pursue the research or research training that you describe the renovated  facility being used for.</p>
