          <blockquote>
            <p>Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) </p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP)</strong> program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and success for historically underrepresented minority doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty, particularly African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders, in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields.  New and innovative models are encouraged, as are models that reproduce and/or replicate existing evidence-based alliances in significantly different disciplines, institutions, and participant cohorts.</p>
            <p>The AGEP program goal is to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty, in specific STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields, by advancing knowledge about pathways to career success.  The program objectives include: To support the development, implementation and study of innovative models of doctoral education, postdoctoral training, and faculty advancement for historically underrepresented minorities in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields; and to advance knowledge about the underlying issues, policies and practices that have an impact on the participation, transitions and advancement of historically underrepresented minorities in the STEM academy.</p>
            <p>The AGEP Transformation Alliance projects are collaborative research projects representing new strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study evidence-based models to transform doctoral education, postdoctoral training, and faculty advancement for historically underrepresented minorities in specific STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. Embedded social science and education research contributes to the knowledge base about how transformational models eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive policies and practices for historically underrepresented minorities.</p>
            <p>AGEP addresses academic workforce development in a broadening participation and institutional capacity building context. Strategic collaborations are encouraged with multiple academic partners, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, professional organizations, government agencies, national laboratories, field stations, teaching and learning centers, informal science centers, and other relevant STEM and/or STEM education research organizations.  The AGEP program encourages project leadership by, and partnerships with, all types of minority serving institutions, such as majority minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, high Hispanic enrollment institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and institutions serving native Hawaiians, native Pacific Islanders, and/or Alaskan natives.</p>
            <p><strong>Note to students and postdoctoral scholars seeking support: The AGEP program does not make awards to individual students or postdoctoral scholars to undertake their education or research activities.  </strong>Undergraduates and graduate students seeking support for graduate education should review the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program (GRFP) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://nsfgrfp.org/">http://nsfgrfp.org/</a>). Postdoctoral scholars seeking support should review the NSF postdoctoral programs summarized at <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/servlet/fastlane.pdoc.DisplayProgramType">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/servlet/fastlane.pdoc.DisplayProgramType</a>. Additionally, some NSF Directorates may have special funding opportunities to support students and postdoctoral trainees that contribute to broadening participation in STEM. NSF principal investigators seeking funds to support students and postdoctoral trainees, who are members of historically underrepresented minority groups, are encouraged to contact their NSF program officer for information on potential opportunities.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
      
            <p>Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) is a National Science Foundation program in the Human Resource Development (HRD) division of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. Since AGEP began funding awards in 1998, it has been committed to the national goal of increasing the number of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs), specifically African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Native Pacific Islanders, completing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduate education and contributing to the diversity of the STEM professoriate. The investment emphasis currently focuses on advancing knowledge about innovative models to transform and improve pathways and success for URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty in all STEM and STEM education research fields.  The AGEP program goal is to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty, in specific STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields, by advancing knowledge about pathways to career success.  New models and knowledge about STEM doctoral education, postdoctoral training and faculty advancement that concentrate on URMs can have a significant impact on the diversity of the U.S. STEM workforce generally, and on the innovations generated by diverse academic research and development teams.</p>
            <p>Advancing knowledge about new models of STEM doctoral education, postdoctoral training and faculty advancement, as well as knowledge about the underlying issues, policies and practices impacting the participation, transitions and advancement of URMs in the STEM academy, is aligned with recommendations and strategies identified in reports from the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2012), National Academy of Sciences (2011), and the Council of Graduate Schools (2015). As our nation&rsquo;s universities and colleges seek to better prepare our future STEM workforce, it is essential that STEM academic communities value racial and ethnic diversity, implement supportive broadening participation practices, and reward a multi-cultural learning and research climate (Byars-Winston, 2014; Franklin, et al, 2014; Whittaker &amp; Montgomery, 2013).</p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The AGEP program supports advancing knowledge about innovative models of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and faculty advancement of historically underrepresented minorities, specifically African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Native Pacific Islanders, in STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields. As evidence-based prototypes are developed, implemented and studied, the outcomes of the work should contribute to a better understanding of the underlying issues, policies and practices that have an impact on the participation, transitions and advancement of individuals who are historically underrepresented minorities in the STEM academy. Through alliances supported by the program, NSF is particularly interested in building knowledge in areas related to the following questions:</p>
          <p>What are the underlying issues affecting the differential participation rates by historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in doctoral education, postdoctoral training, and academic careers in STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields?</p>
          <p>What are the interpersonal, organizational and professional experiences and mechanisms in doctoral and postdoctoral settings that enhance or inhibit academic performance and professional development? Do these experiences and mechanisms encourage or discourage persistence to degree completion, participation and success in postdoctoral training, and advancement in the STEM and STEM education research professoriates?</p>
          <p>Which model components for transforming doctoral education, postdoctoral training and faculty advancement in STEM, and STEM education research, have the greatest potential for reproducibility and sustainability across our Nation&rsquo;s postsecondary institutions?</p>
          <p>How does a diverse graduate student body, postdoctoral trainee population, and academic workforce affect innovation and productivity in STEM, and STEM education research?</p>
          <p>These questions guide the knowledge the AGEP program strives to advance in the field. Alliance proposers are encouraged to propose project components that will investigate unique research questions and not the four aforementioned program-level questions.</p>
          <p><strong>AGEP Transformation Alliances:</strong> Support is available for new AGEP Transformation Alliance projects that are expected to be collaborative research proposals with a duration up to 60 months, and have a combined budget request, across all collaborating proposers, of up to $2,000,000. The new AGEP Transformation Alliances develop, implement and study innovative models to transform doctoral education, postdoctoral training and faculty advancement of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research careers. Proposers are encouraged to review the Proposal Preparation Instructions found in this solicitation.</p>
          <p>New AGEP Transformation Alliance projects are expected to identify a model that includes innovative and systemic organizational approaches based on evidence about why specific model components are worthy of continued development, reproduction, implementation testing, investigation and sustainability. It is essential for proposers to provide evidence for the selection of each model component and to describe how an innovative model combining these components will be developed and studied, or replicated and investigated within a different STEM discipline and/or institutional context.</p>
          <p>Strong projects include proof of prior model (or model component), development, research and implementation outcomes. All proposals must include a description about how the model will advance information regarding the underlying institutional and professional issues, policies and practices affecting the participation, transitions and/or professional advancement of historically underrepresented minorities in academic STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields. Proposers must also explain how the projected outcomes of the new model&rsquo;s development, implementation and testing activities are expected to have lasting impacts on the institutions involved in the project leading to sustainability of project activities and transformation of the organization&rsquo;s programs, policies and practices.</p>
          <p>Proposers may choose to focus the model on the participation and/or professional progression of historically underrepresented minorities at one or more levels: the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training, and/or the experiences of faculty in tenure and non-tenure track lines. Each level is a legitimate target to investigate, as are the transitions within and across levels. For example, proposers may investigate graduate education at dissertator level and/or any one or combination of the following transitions: from doctoral education to postdoctoral training; from doctoral study, postdoctoral training and/or industry to faculty positions; from assistant to associate professorship; and/or from non-tenured to tenured faculty status. No more than 10% of the requested direct budget costs may be requested for Participant Support Costs to cover stipends, travel, subsistence and other expenses for student, postdoctoral trainee and/or faculty participants. Additionally, all project participants must be United States citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. The term "national" designates a native resident of a commonwealth or territory of the United States, such as American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. It does not refer to a citizen of another country who has applied for United States citizenship and who has not received U.S. citizenship.</p>
          <p>Projects also contribute to knowledge building focused on broadening participation, institutional capacity building, and institutional transformation by including an integrated social science or educational research component in the project that investigates the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, and/or institutional mechanisms that support or inhibit the progress of historically underrepresented minority doctoral students, postdoctoral trainees and/or faculty in STEM and/or in STEM education research. Proposers may also study the intersection of race and ethnicity with gender, disability, socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics that may impact doctoral degree completion, postdoctoral training and faculty career progression. Additionally, an integrated research component may also investigate the institutional climate, policies and practices that affect the model&rsquo;s development, implementation, study, reproducibility and sustainability.</p>
          <p>Proposed alliance activities must form a feasible, logical, and comprehensive effort focused on developing, implementing and investigating a new model of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement in STEM and/or STEM education research. Alliance proposals are required to describe in detail the comprehensive plan that will be implemented both alliance-wide and at the individual institutions, and explain the unique contributions that each institutional partner will contribute to the alliance activities. All proposals should include a description of the theory of change, or logic model guiding the proposed project work, and plans for management, research, evaluation (see project evaluation guidance) and dissemination.</p>
          <p>Strategic research collaborations are encouraged with multiple academic partners, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, professional organizations, government agencies, national laboratories, field stations, teaching and learning centers, informal science centers, and other relevant STEM academic and research entities. All types of academic and non-academic institutions may lead and collaborate with other institutions to conduct the alliance&rsquo;s model development, implementation and study. The AGEP program encourages project leadership by, and partnerships with, all types of minority serving institutions, such as majority minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, high Hispanic enrollment institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and institutions serving native Hawaiians, native Pacific Islanders, and/or Alaskan natives. Proposers are expected to describe why each partnering institution or organization has been selected and what benefits will result for each one, as well as how activities will be sustained at the collaborating research institutions.</p>
          <p>AGEP supports the integration of education and research in STEM. This integration occurs within an academic STEM discipline, across fields and as a result of multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary collaborations. Proposers are given wide latitude in designing their alliance to include one or more STEM disciplines and/or STEM education research fields as part of the project&rsquo;s focus.</p>
          <p>Competitive proposals continue and build upon established professional relationships and collaborations, with multiple academic partners, and they leverage existing or prior NSF support emphasizing broadening participation in STEM. Proposers are encouraged to collaborate with institutions with active NSF awards from programs such as, but not limited to, the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program&rsquo;s Bridge to the Doctorate activities; the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) program; the ADVANCE: Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers program; the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP); and the various postdoctoral research fellowship programs found across the foundation in the Directorates for Biological Sciences, Geosciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.</p>
          <p>Formative and summative assessment of the AGEP Transformation Alliance projects are high priorities for the AGEP program. All proposals must include an evaluation section that describes how the project will be independently evaluated to determine goal, objective, and activity progress; and project accomplishments, outcomes, and impacts. The project evaluation should be designed to serve as a valuable source of information on how the project is being developed, implemented and tested, as well as what works and what should be modified. Evaluation plans, developed and implemented by an external and independent evaluation expert, should link directly to the project&rsquo;s logic model or theory of change, and include evaluation questions to be answered that are specific to measuring project activities, progress, accomplishments, outcomes, and impacts. Evaluation plans should be appropriate to the size and scope of the project, and usually include both formative and summative components based on the evaluation questions of interest along with a proposed timeline. The purpose of a formative evaluation is to provide information for project improvement. The purpose of a summative evaluation is to assess the quality, outcomes, and impact of the project. Formative evaluation plans outline methods for documenting progress toward project goals and should include a feedback feature that allows for continuous improvement of the project activities. A summative evaluation collects information about accomplishments, outcomes, and impacts of the project, and about the related processes, strategies, and activities that have led to them. The budget must include adequate resources for the project evaluation. Project evaluation should be led by an expert independent evaluator or evaluation team, depending on the size and scope of the project. Evaluators are expected to adhere to the American Evaluation Association&rsquo;s Guiding Principles for Evaluators (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=51">http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=51</a>), and project evaluations are expected to be consistent with standards established by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.jcsee.org/program-evaluation-standards-statements">http://www.jcsee.org/program-evaluation-standards-statements</a>).

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
    
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
         <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
