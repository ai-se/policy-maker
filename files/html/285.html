        <h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>
         
          <p>The planned outcome of this solicitation is to establish the final three awards for the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) - Network Coordination Office (NCO), Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter), and Post-Disaster, Rapid Response Research (RAPID) Facility.   The NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility components for NHERI were originally competed under program solicitation <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm"> NSF 14-605</a>, Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) 2015-2019, but no awards for these components were made under that solicitation.  Because the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility are integral awards for an integrated NHERI facility, this solicitation includes information about all four components of NHERI listed in <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a>: NCO, Cyberinfrastructure (CI), SimCenter and Experimental Facility (EF).  The RAPID Facility is considered part of the EF cohort.  However, under this solicitation, proposals will only be accepted for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility.  All other proposals will be returned without review.</p>
          <p>Proposers to this solicitation should carefully read through this entire solicitation, as revisions from <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a> to this solicitation have been made, most notably in Section II, Program Description; Section IV, Eligibility Information; Section V.A., Proposal Preparation Instructions; and Section V.B, Budgetary Information.</p>
          <p><strong>Compliance and Return without Review</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Proposals submitted after the full proposal deadline of November 4, 2015, 5 p.m. proposer's local time, will be returned without review</strong>. Only those proposals submitted prior to the full proposal deadline and in full compliance with this solicitation and the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) contained in the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf15001">NSF 15-1</a>) will be accepted for review. Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit their proposal to this solicitation at least several days in advance of the full proposal deadline, so that the submitting institution's Sponsored Projects Office, Principal Investigator (PI), and co-PIs can download the submitted proposal, review it for completeness and compliance with the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation and the GPG, and make revisions needed to bring the proposal into compliance prior to the full proposal deadline. If the proposal is submitted by the proposal deadline, then the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation will allow proposers to self-check their proposal for compliance and submit proposal file update(s) with corrections by November 6, 2015, 5 p.m. proposer's local time, after the full proposal deadline. The proposal file update(s) will be accepted by NSF. CMMI staff will not give proposers feedback on compliance before the November 6, 2015, 5 p.m. proposer's local time deadline for submitting proposal file updates.  Note that FastLane has implemented automated compliance checks for certain sections of proposals during submission, and FastLane may reject the submission for noncompliance with these checks. This rejection may delay proposal submission, which will result in return without review if the proposal submission time stamp is after the full proposal deadline. After November 6, 2015, the CMMI Division will then check proposals for compliance with the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation and the GPG. Noncompliant proposals will result in return without review.  Appendix X of this solicitation provides a full proposal compliance checklist.</p>
          <p><strong>Important Information</strong></p>

          <p>Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf15001">NSF 15-1</a>), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after December 26, 2014. The PAPPG is consistent with, and, implements the new Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) (2 CFR &sect; 200).</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The planned outcome of this solicitation is to establish the final three awards for the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) - Network Coordination Office (NCO), Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter), and Post-Disaster, Rapid Response Research (RAPID) Facility. The NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility components for NHERI were originally competed under program solicitation <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a>, Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) 2015-2019, but no awards for these components were made under that solicitation.

The RAPID Facility is considered part of the EF cohort.  Under this solicitation, proposals will only be accepted for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility. All other proposals will be returned without review.</p>
            <p>NHERI is the next generation of National Science Foundation (NSF) support for a natural hazards engineering research large facility, replacing the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). NEES was established by NSF as a distributed, multi-user, national research infrastructure for earthquake engineering through a facility construction phase during 2000 - 2004, followed by operations of this infrastructure to support research, innovation, and education activities from October 2004 through September 2014.</p>
            <p>NHERI will be a distributed, multi-user, national facility that will provide the natural hazards engineering community with access to research infrastructure (earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data), coupled with education and community outreach activities. NHERI will enable research and educational advances that can contribute knowledge and innovation for the nation's civil infrastructure and communities to prevent natural hazard events from becoming societal disasters.</p>
            <p>NHERI will consist of the following components, established through separate awards:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>NCO - one award to be made under this solicitation;</li>
              <li>SimCenter - one award to be made under this solicitation;</li>
              <li>Experimental Facility:  RAPID Facility - one award to be made under this solicitation;</li>
              <li>CI - one award made under NSF 14-605; and</li>
              <li>Experimental Facilities for earthquake engineering and wind engineering research - six or seven awards made under <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Under this solicitation, one cooperative agreement for the NCO, one cooperative agreement for the SimCenter, and one cooperative agreement for the RAPID Facility are anticipated to commence in early calendar 2016, with a five-year award duration. These three Awardees will not conduct research.  The primary research enabled by NHERI will be conducted by investigators supported through separate NSF awards. The NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility Awardees, along with the other NHERI Awardees and the natural hazards engineering community, will work together, through Governance and Awardee activities, to establish a shared vision for NHERI, set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make NHERI a value-added and productive research infrastructure. </p>

          <p>This section provides an overview of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI), which originally was described and competed under program solicitation NSF 14-605, Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) 2015-2019.   NSF 14-605 competed the four NHERI components: Network Coordination Office (NCO), Cyberinfrastructure (CI), Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter), and Experimental Facility (EF), which included a post-disaster, rapid response research (RAPID) Facility.  No awards for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility, however, were made under <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a>.  This solicitation only requests proposals for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility, and Section II provides further description of these three components.   Proposals submitted to this solicitation for any of the other components, i.e., CI and an EF other than a RAPID Facility, will be returned without review.</p>
          <p><strong>A. Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>During the past several decades, the United States has experienced major earthquake and windstorm (e.g., tornado and hurricane) events, resulting in loss of life, injuries, extensive damage, and loss of basic services vital for post-disaster response and recovery. Such impacts have led to long recovery periods for communities, states, and the nation. The use of experimental testing, computational modeling and simulation, research data, and their integration with theory have become increasingly important research resources to create the knowledge and innovation needed to mitigate the impact of earthquakes and windstorms on our nation's physical civil infrastructure: buildings and other structures, underground structures, and critical lifelines such as communications, energy, transportation, and water/wastewater systems (References 1-6, Section IX).</p>
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported the construction (fiscal year (FY) 2000 - 2004) and operations (FY 2005 - 2014) of distributed, multi-user, national earthquake engineering research infrastructure (experimental facilities and cyberinfrastructure) through the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). Through use of NEES, NSF-supported researchers have advanced fundamental knowledge about the seismic performance of civil infrastructure and created sustainable technologies for structural design, structural rehabilitation, and site remediation; computational, simulation, and visualization research tools; experimental simulation techniques and instrumentation; and sensor technologies. In addition, researchers have deployed NEES equipment, sensors, and data acquisition systems to capture large aftershock building response and generate site profiling data following the 2010 Chile and 2010/2011 New Zealand earthquakes. NEES operations was managed under a five-year cooperative agreement during FY 2010 - FY 2014 with Purdue University, hereinafter referred to as the "incumbent." The NEES research infrastructure supported by the incumbent is described at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nees.org">http://www.nees.org</a>. NSF's support for operations of the NEES experimental facilities and research ended on September 30, 2014. However, through NSF support, the incumbent will continue to operate only the NEEShub cyberinfrastructure through September 30, 2015, to provide continued operations for the research community and to assist the NHERI CI Awardee with the cyberinfrastructure transition.</p>
          <p>NHERI will be a distributed, multi-user, national facility that will provide the natural hazards engineering community with access to research infrastructure (earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data), coupled with education and community outreach activities. NHERI will enable the community to make research and educational advances collaboratively that can contribute knowledge and innovation to prevent natural hazards from becoming societal disasters. This knowledge base could potentially transform how future civil infrastructure will be designed and how existing civil infrastructure might be rehabilitated.</p>
          <p>In accordance with the National Science Board (NSB) Statement on Competition, Recompetition, and Renewal of NSF awards (NSB-08-16) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2008/nsb0816_statement.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2008/nsb0816_statement.pdf</a>), NHERI will be openly competed and will consist of the following components/awards:</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p><a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a> competed the four NHERI components: Network Coordination Office (NCO), Cyberinfrastructure (CI), Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter), and Experimental Facility (EF), which included a post-disaster, rapid response research (RAPID) Facility.  No awards for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility, however, were made under <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a>.  To complete NHERI, this solicitation requests proposals only for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility, which are described below in Sections II.B through II.F.  Proposals submitted to this solicitation for any other component, i.e., CI and an EF other than a RAPID Facility, will be returned without review.  Because the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility integral awards for an integrated NHERI facility, this section includes information about the overall concept for NHERI originally described in <a href="http://www.acpt.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">NSF 14-605</a> and the four components of NHERI listed in NSF 14-605: NCO, CI, SimCenter, and EF. </p>
          <p><strong>A. Vision for NHERI</strong></p>
          <p>NHERI will support multi-hazards engineering research and education, with a focus on earthquake and wind engineering. Historically, research on physical civil infrastructure materials, design, and performance has focused on resilience for a single natural hazard. However, civil infrastructure designed to be multi-hazard resilient will contribute toward broader societal goals, i.e., protect people and property, maintain continuity in essential operations and services, and recover rapidly from a natural hazard event. Design of civil infrastructure is also changing, as strategies for green civil infrastructure are emerging, addressing societal goals for a sustainable nation. Examples of sustainable strategies include sustainable materials, minimization of non-renewable energy use, use of on-site renewable energy source(s), and maximization of material reuse and recyclable components. However, civil infrastructure designs for single hazard resilience do not always take advantage of new technologies for sustainable civil infrastructure and may not provide multi-hazard resilience. NHERI will support research on sustainable civil infrastructure for resilience to single and multiple hazards, such as earthquakes and windstorms.</p>
          <p>NHERI will enable research and education that can contribute knowledge and innovation for civil infrastructure, over its lifespan, to be multi-hazard resilient and sustainable. NHERI will also support NSF's core value to broaden opportunities and expand participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Reference 7, Section IX). NSF is committed to this principle of inclusiveness.</p>
          <p>The vision for NHERI is to enable frontier research and education to:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Understand, model, and predict the lifecycle performance of civil infrastructure, from component to holistic system levels, under different natural hazard events;</li>
            <li>Reduce the reliance on physical testing for modeling the performance of civil infrastructure under natural hazard events through advanced computational modeling and simulation capabilities;</li>
            <li>Build the basic science knowledge and computational modeling and simulation capabilities to evaluate multi-hazard resilient and sustainable civil infrastructure and communities;</li>
            <li>Translate research into innovative mitigation strategies and technologies to reduce the impact of natural hazards on existing and new sustainable civil infrastructure and communities; and</li>
            <li>Integrate research, education, and outreach to train a broad and inclusive STEM workforce to conduct and translate research into an innovation ecosystem for multi-hazard resilient and sustainable civil infrastructure and communities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>B. NHERI Construct: Operational Goals and Governance, Awardee, and User Roles</strong></p>
          <p>To support this vision, the operational goals for NHERI are the following:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Effective Council of Awardees (hereinafter referred to as the Council), which provides the collective and coordinated leadership for NHERI to operate as an integrated, cohesive, and transparent national facility in service to the natural hazards engineering community;</li>
            <li>Excellence in Awardee leadership, management, award administration, performance assessment, user support, and safe and secure operations of its resources, services, and data infrastructure;</li>
            <li>Active involvement of the natural hazards engineering community in Governance and Awardee activities;</li>
            <li>Open and equal access to NHERI, with NHERI used by an external and broadly inclusive user base of researchers and educators;</li>
            <li>Evidence-based development of the current and next generation workforce to conduct natural hazards engineering research, educational activities, and professional practice; and</li>
            <li>Value-added strategic partnerships that bring additional unique national and international resources and capabilities to NHERI.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The NHERI construct will consist of the Awardees (NCO, CI, SimCenter and EF), Governance, and Users, with the role for each outlined below in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  The RAPID Facility is considered part of the EF cohort.  The Awardees and user community will work together, through Awardee and Governance activities, to establish a shared community vision for NHERI, set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make NHERI a value-added and productive national facility.</p>
          <p><strong>Awardees</strong>: The awards will have the roles shown in Table 1; the requirements and responsibilities for all Awardees and for each component/Awardee are outlined later in this section.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Note: Proposals submitted to this solicitation for the SimCenter component must address these SimCenter Component - Additional Awardee Requirements, Responsibilities, and Key Year-One Milestones.</strong></p>
          <p>NSF's vision for cyberinfrastructure in Reference 8 (Section IX) identifies advancing new computational infrastructure as a priority for driving innovation in science and engineering. Software is an integral enabler of theory, computation, experimentation, and data-enabled science and engineering, and a central component of the new computational infrastructure. The SimCenter will serve as the leader and community resource within NHERI to provide new high quality, community-prioritized, online computational modeling and simulation tools to advance the NHERI vision outlined in Section II.A and the five-year NHERI Science Plan. These tools should address the natural hazards engineering community's computational needs identified in References 2-6 (Section IX) and obtained through ongoing requirements gathering with all stakeholders. The SimCenter investment should produce robust, reliable, usable, and sustainable software critical for potentially transforming the conduct and productivity of natural hazards engineering research, education, and innovation. The SimCenter proposal should present a compelling scientific case for its need and scope within NHERI, and the anticipated broader, societal impact of its computational modeling and simulation tools within the natural hazards engineering community. Through its performance metrics, the SimCenter will capture data, both qualitative and quantitative, describing how the SimCenter is meeting its stated goals, the quality and extent of use of SimCenter software tools, the impact on natural hazards engineering research and education, how the SimCenter has enabled new science and broader impacts, the impact on next generation workforce training and broadening participation, and extent of engagement of users and the natural hazards engineering community in all its activities. All SimCenter activities must proactively incorporate and demonstrate inclusiveness of groups underrepresented in STEM. </p>
          <p>The award for the SimCenter will only support development of new computational modeling and simulation tools. This award will not support the maintenance, further development, enhancement, and user support of existing software. The SimCenter&rsquo;s software tools will be delivered to and implemented on the CI Awardee&rsquo;s software service delivery platform, using interfaces to be specified by the CI Awardee (see Section II.G). The SimCenter and CI Awardees will work cooperatively together to make the SimCenter software tools productive and supportive for the user community. All software tools developed should be open source and compatible with computing resources made available by the CI Awardee. The SimCenter is responsible for development, user support, outreach, training, documentation, and usability studies for all its software tools. During year one, the SimCenter should focus on development and implementation of only a few selected computational modeling and simulation tools, with companion educational modules and case studies, to demonstrate and refine its software development and lifecycle management plan and its interface with the CI Awardee's software service delivery platform, while it works with the community to gather requirements and priorities for computational modeling and simulation tools to be developed in years two through five.</p>
          <p>The SimCenter's core software staff is responsible for executing the software development and lifecycle management of each software tool to ensure a consistent and production-quality implementation on the CI Awardee's software service delivery platform. For each software tool development, the SimCenter staff should collaborate closely with a working group of core internal as well as core external domain experts, who are all financially supported by the SimCenter, to provide user input and pseudo code during the development process.  To provide sufficient level of effort to enable on-time completion of software tools, the core internal and external domain experts should be supported for at least one month annually.  After the SimCenter award is made, the working group may be expanded to include unfunded collaborators, as appropriate for the software tool.  The domain experts should be selected through a transparent, equitable, and inclusive community process and include an appropriate mix of expertise required for the task, from areas such as earthquake, wind, and other engineering fields, computer science, information science, visualization, materials science, architecture, mathematical sciences, and social, behavioral and economic sciences.</p>
          <p>The SimCenter Awardee should leverage existing cyberinfrastructure, software infrastructure, knowledge management and workflow productivity tools, and computing resources to enable this component to focus its primary effort and budget on the development of new computational modeling and simulation tools specifically for the natural hazards engineering community. The SimCenter Awardee will deliver a portfolio of online tools that reflects a balance of new capabilities for earthquake engineering research, wind engineering research, and multi-hazards engineering research. Examples of tools that might be developed include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Multi-scale, multi-physics, mechanics-based computational modeling capabilities for civil infrastructure components and systems that will reduce the reliance on physical testing to characterize the impact of natural hazards on new designs and materials;</li>
            <li>Validated, computational fluid dynamics software tools for wind engineering applications;</li>
            <li>Complex, multi-scale, multi-physics simulations of the impact of a natural hazard event on an urban city or region, integrated with visualization and decision-making tools;</li>
            <li>Tools to synthesize data from multiple media, e.g., digital, imaging, video, and/or remote sensing, to understand the impact of a natural hazard event on civil infrastructure and communities; and</li>
            <li>Civil infrastructure lifecycle assessment tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Requirements</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Staffing (in addition to Section II.C): </em>The SimCenter leadership, management, and core software staff should be located at the lead institution. The SimCenter Director (SimCenter Awardee PI), in addition to the requirements in Section II.C, should have prior accomplishments in software development. The leadership, management, and core software staff, including the composition of the PI and co-PI team, should reflect a balance of senior-level expertise and prior accomplishments in the domain science (earthquake engineering and wind engineering); software development, project management, implementation, and sustainability; on-time software delivery; best practices; validation and verification; user manuals and software documentation; on-line educational software tools; usability; and user training and support.

          <p><strong>F.  RAPID Facility Component (part of the Experimental Facility component) - Additional Awardee Requirements, Responsibilities, and Key Milestones</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Note:  Proposals submitted to this solicitation for the RAPID Facility component must address these RAPID Facility Component - Additional Awardee Requirements, Responsibilities, and Key Milestones.</strong></p>
          <p>The RAPID Facility is considered part of the Experimental Facility (EF) component cohort. For decades, NSF has supported researchers to gather perishable research data immediately following a natural hazard event in the United States or abroad.  These awards have collected perishable data on the impacts of an event on natural systems, constructed civil infrastructure, social and economic processes, and response and recovery.  These data have been used in subsequent research to advance knowledge for improving preparedness, mitigation, emergency response, and recovery strategies.  The RAPID Facility will provide resources (such as equipment, instrumentation, and data management infrastructure) for quick field deployment globally to support perishable research data collection following an earthquake or windstorm event.  The primary users of the RAPID Facility resources will be researchers supported through separate NSF awards for post-disaster investigations, with assistance in the field from RAPID Facility staff, as required.   While the primary focus of this facility must be for perishable data collection following earthquake and windstorm events, this does not preclude facility resources being deployed for perishable data collection following other natural hazard events.  All collected data must be curated and archived in the NHERI data repository.</p>
          <p>This facility must be designed to meet the requirements and responsibilities for all Awardees in Section II.C and the RAPID Facility in this section.  The RAPID Facility will work closely with: (a) the CI Awardee to develop and implement a facility data management plan to accommodate RAPID Facility data in the NHERI data repository, (b) the NCO Facility Scheduler for scheduling use of facility resources, and (c) the natural hazards community to develop and make this facility operational by the end of the second year of the award.  The facility will actively engage the natural hazards community in meetings and workshops during year one to develop the concept for this facility, including requirements for equipment, instrumentation, and data management; user support and training programs; field logistics and safety; roles and responsibilities of users vs. facility staff; and manuals, policies, and procedures for accessing and using facility resources.  The RAPID Facility Director will convene an External Steering Committee, with membership independent from institution(s) involved in the facility, during years one and two to provide independent oversight advice and guidance during facility development.  The facility will annually provide evidence of an active, external, and broadly inclusive user base beyond researchers and educators located at the Awardee institution.  To enable an orderly award closure period, use of facility resources will be completed by the facility at least two months prior to the original expiration date of the cooperative agreement.</p>
          <p>This solicitation will not support the following for RAPID Facility proposals; proposals that request the following will be returned without review:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Post-fire perishable data collection;</li>
            <li>Equipment and instrumentation that do not support perishable data collection following an earthquake or windstorm event;</li>
            <li>Major equipment refurbishments and upgrades, capital improvements to existing laboratory buildings and space, and construction of new buildings;</li>
            <li>A distributed facility, with resources owned, housed, and/or maintained by multiple organizations;</li>
            <li>A facility with any resources that can only be accessed or used outside the United States; and</li>
            <li>A facility for long-term instrumented structures and/or field sites.</li>

          <p><strong>G. Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Component - Additional Awardee Requirements, Responsibilities, and Key Year-One Milestones</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Note:  This section is provided only for reference since the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility must all interact with the CI component.   This solicitation is not receiving proposals for the CI component.  Proposals submitted for the CI component will be returned without review. </strong></p>
          <p>Cyberinfrastructure underpins and integrates NHERI as a virtual organization and provides Awardees and users with resources and services for research, collaboration and knowledge sharing. It enables discovery, technology transfer, innovation, education, and community outreach. It can also bring additional resources to NHERI through leveraging and interoperability with other NSF and Federally supported cyberinfrastructure projects. The CI Awardee may propose to change the NHERI name/acronym to be consistent with an appropriate and available Internet domain name. If NSF accepts this new name/acronym, then at the pre-award stage, NSF will change the titles of all NHERI awards to begin with this new acronym.</p>
          <p>The overall design and operations of the cyberinfrastructure should incorporate research and best practices in providing cyberinfrastructure for virtual organizations. In addition, the CI Awardee should seek additional NSF funding opportunities to expand/enhance the cyberinfrastructure beyond the support provided under the NHERI award. The cyberinfrastructure will not be static and should evolve as the community develops richer tools with increasing data volumes and computational requirements; therefore, operations should include a strategy to periodically refresh/upgrade the cyberinfrastructure through new releases.</p>
          <p>The CI Awardee should utilize/adapt the incumbent's NEEShub cyberinfrastructure content (including data and education materials) currently available on the NEEShub platform at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nees.org">http://www.nees.org</a> to the new cyberinfrastructure. These content, software, and tools must be integrated into the Awardee's cyberinfrastructure in a way that does not preclude their sharing and future porting and use across other platforms. If transition to a different platform becomes necessary in the future, then the CI Awardee will be responsible for ensuring that all content, software, and tools are fully transitioned to that platform without requiring renegotiation of proprietary agreements.</p>
          <p>The current NEEShub Project Warehouse is based on commercial database software and primarily contains earthquake engineering experimental data. The NHERI data repository should be resourced to curate and archive the following data: (1) earthquake engineering data in the NEEShub Project Warehouse, (2) experimental data from NSF-supported awards that tested under the incumbent's operations and are not yet archived and curated, (3) experimental data generated by awards under the NSF 13-544, George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research Planning Grants, and NSF 14-557, Decision Frameworks for Multi-Hazard Resilient and Sustainable Buildings, solicitations, (4) experimental data generated through use of NHERI resources, and (5) by the end of year two, the capacity to archive and curate the following: experimental data generated by earthquake and wind engineering research awards supported by NSF (whether or not NHERI resources are used), data collected from earthquake and windstorm event investigations using RAPID Facility resources, data collected under NSF-supported RAPID awards investigating earthquakes and windstorms, legacy data sets identified as high priority data by the earthquake and wind engineering research communities, and experimental data from global partners that are agreed upon by the CI Awardee in support of such partnerships.</p>
          <p><em>Requirements</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Location:</em> To the maximum extent practical, the CI Awardee's role, requirements, responsibilities, resources, and services should be implemented by staff employed at the Awardee's institution.</li>
            <li><em>Staffing (additional):</em> The CI Director (CI Awardee PI) also should have prior accomplishments in cyberinfrastructure design, development, operations, and management for research communities. The leadership, management, and operations staff should have expertise and prior accomplishments in developing, deploying, operating, and maintaining cyberinfrastructure, including an open source, archival and curated data repository and a software service delivery platform, and be knowledgeable in earthquake and wind engineering research experimentation, computation, digital preservation, metadata and data. The staff should be skilled in software development, making software user friendly, and providing user training and support.</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>H.  Experimental Facility Component, excluding the RAPID Facility - Additional Awardee Requirements, Responsibilities, and Key Year-One Milestones</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Note: This section is provided only for reference since the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility will interface with other EF component awards. This solicitation is not receiving proposals for the EF component, with the exception of the RAPID Facility discussed in Section II.F.   Proposals submitted for an EF component other than for a RAPID Facility will be returned without review. </strong></p>
          <p>This section outlines the additional Awardee requirements, responsibilities, and key milestones for all EF Awardees, with the exception of the RAPID Facility, which is described separately in Section II.F.   An EF Awardee will provide the experimental resources, services, and capabilities for earthquake engineering research or wind engineering research to address the NHERI vision in Section II.A, operational goals in Section II.B, and its own Science Plan. Each EF Awardee will provide unique, technically advanced, major earthquake engineering research or wind engineering research experimental equipment and instrumentation that do not exist elsewhere in the United States at comparable scale and testing capability. As part of the NHERI portfolio, the EF Awardees collectively will demonstrate, at the national scale, unique, complementary, and synergistic experimental, cyberinfrastructure, and education and outreach capabilities. Each EF Awardee will annually provide evidence of an active, external, and broadly inclusive user base beyond researchers and educators located at the Awardee institution. To enable an orderly award closure period, all experimental testing and use of facility resources will be completed at the EF at least two months prior to the original expiration date of the cooperative agreement.</p>
          <p>An EF proposed with an earthquake engineering research focus does not need to be limited to the 14 NEES experimental facilities supported under the incumbent's award. This solicitation will not support the following; proposals that request the following will be returned without review:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fire testing equipment and capabilities;</li>
            <li>Experimental capabilities that do not support earthquake engineering or wind engineering research;</li>
            <li>With the exception of the RAPID Facility, the establishment of a new laboratory, acquisition of new/replacement major experimental equipment, major equipment refurbishments and upgrades, capital improvements to existing laboratory buildings and space, and construction of new buildings;</li>
            <li>A distributed facility, with resources owned, housed, and/or maintained by multiple organizations;</li>
            <li>A facility with any equipment that can only be accessed or used outside the United States;</li>
            <li>A facility with the primary focus and capability for development of advanced experimental testing algorithms and techniques; and</li>
            <li>A facility for long-term instrumented structures and/or field sites.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Requirements</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Location:</em> The EF Awardee's experimental resources will be housed within the United States at a single academic institution. EF resources may be operated outside the United States for short-term periods to support research. If the EF is part of a larger institutional laboratory complex and its associated budget and accounting, then its personnel effort, resources, and budget under the NHERI award are to be accounted for and tracked separately from the larger laboratory administration. (Exception: Shared-use instrumentation acquired post-award as the result of an annual Council work plan may be housed and maintained by one EF Awardee on behalf of the network.)</li>
            <li><em>Staffing (additional): </em>The EF Director (EF Awardee PI) also should have expertise in facility operations and should be the main point of contact for users. The EF Awardee should have sufficient staff and technical expertise to support daily operations, maintenance and calibration, experimentation, scheduling with the NCO's Facility Scheduling Protocol, and users, and should include a designated safety officer and an information technology (IT) specialist to support data management, telepresence, and cybersecurity.</li>
            <li><em>EF Resource Allocations for NSF-supported Awards: </em>The Awardee will proactively market its resources and capabilities to lead to significant annual facility resource use by NSF-supported research and education awards, to justify its role and continued NSF support as a national, multi-user EF. Sufficient time will be allocated annually for each facility resource to accommodate NSF-supported awards, user training, and participation in the NCO's REU site and Summer Institute programs.</li>
            <li><em>Facility Resource Scheduling:</em> The EF Awardee will delegate daily scheduling of facility resources to the NCO Facility Scheduling Protocol, with the EF scheduler providing input into the scheduling process.</li>
            <li><em>User Fees/Recharge Rates: </em>The EF Awardee will maintain institutionally-established user fees/recharge rates during the entire award period for the resources and services that will be available to users.</li>
            <li><em>Annual Institutional Laboratory Inspection for EH&amp;S,</em> with corrective actions promptly taken.</li>

Each EF Awardee will be responsible for insurance and indemnification;</li>
            <li><em>Standard Experimental Protocols:</em> Provide standard experimental protocols, so that users can efficiently write proposals for using facility resources and efficiently plan and conduct experiments;</li>
            <li><em>Data Management Infrastructure: </em>Implement an end-to-end data management plan for the facility, which meets the CI Awardee requirements for data and metadata protocols and formats, archiving, curating, retrieval, automatic upload of data during experimentation to the NHERI data repository or process for upload of validated field data, data curation at the source as feasible, and cybersecurity. The data management plan and EF use should be supported through cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity compliant with institutional and CI Awardee policies;</li>
            <li><em>Facility Financial Operating Plan, </em>which is the annual financial plan for operating the EF showing sufficiency of resources and staffing through costs assigned to the NSF NHERI award and costs to be recovered from users through institutionally-established user fees/recharge rates; and</li>
            <li><em>User Support, </em>to include:
              <ul>
                <li>Identified staff for user support;</li>
                <li>User training and support, with at least one annual on-site training workshop;</li>

        <p><strong>Important Proposal Preparation Information: </strong>FastLane will check for required sections of the proposal, in accordance with <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG) instructions described in Chapter II.C.2. The GPG requires submission of: Project Summary; Project Description; References Cited; Biographical Sketch(es); Budget; Budget Justification; Current and Pending Support; Facilities, Equipment &amp; Other Resources; Data Management Plan; and Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan, if applicable. If a required section is missing, <strong>FastLane will not accept the proposal. </strong></p>
        <p>Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions. If the solicitation instructions do not require a GPG-required section to be included in the proposal, insert text or upload a document in that section of the proposal that states, &quot;Not Applicable for this Program Solicitation.&quot; Doing so will enable FastLane to accept your proposal.</p>
        <p>A full proposal may be submitted only by a lead institution that has submitted a complete LOI by the LOI due date.  A full proposal submitted from an organization that has not submitted a LOI by the due date will be <strong>returned without review</strong>. Due to the complexity of the proposals being submitted, use of FastLane to prepare and submit the full proposal is strongly encouraged.</p>
        <p>The full proposal must conform to the guidelines specified in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) or the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide (as discussed above), and the additional full proposal preparation instructions below, which include deviations from the NSF GPG and the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide as follows;</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>The Project Description must not exceed 55 pages, inclusive of Sections 1-17.</li>
          <li>Additional information is specified for inclusion in the Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources section.</li>
          <li>Additional information is specified for inclusion in the Special Information and Supplementary Documentation section.</li>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the <strong>strengths and weaknesses</strong> of the proposal in response to the requirements and responsibilities described in Section II as follows:</p>

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Internal NSF Review, Site Visit Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>Proposals will be reviewed in accordance with standard NSF external merit review policy, which may consist of a combination of panel and ad hoc mail review. Selected proposals may be further reviewed by a reverse site visit at NSF and/or a campus site visit to the lead institution. Dates for site visits will be communicated by the Lead Cognizant Program Officer to selected PIs as early in the review process as practicable. These dates will be non-negotiable, and it is expected that the PI, co-PIs, and leadership and management team will be available on the scheduled date. It is the responsibility of the PI to assure that contact information for the scheduling of these meetings is correct. Travel and other costs incurred by proposers for this review process will be the responsibility of the proposers. All PIs will receive documentation regarding the review process, including reviews and panel summaries, upon completion of the process.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of the NSF merit review process, proposals to be recommended for an award will undergo a management and budget justification review by NSF staff to assess the lead institution's capability to execute the award and the appropriateness of the budget request. Proposers must be available to provide additional business or budgetary information to support the award recommendation. This review may be done by either a visit from NSF staff to the lead institution or by video teleconference.</p>
       
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
    
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <p>Programmatic and financial/administrative terms and conditions not listed above will be negotiated at the time of award.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>The Awardee must submit a comprehensive annual progress report to NSF containing a summary of the progress during the current year against the performance metrics and work plan and the work plan and budget for the next year funding increment.  Quarterly interim reports will be submitted to track progress during the current year.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
