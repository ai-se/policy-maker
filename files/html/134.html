          <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research </strong>(PAWR) program aims to support advanced wireless research platforms conceived by the U.S. academic and industrial wireless research community. PAWR will enable experimental exploration of robust new wireless devices, communication techniques, networks, systems, and services that will revolutionize the nation&rsquo;s wireless ecosystem, thereby enhancing broadband connectivity, leveraging the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and sustaining US leadership and economic competitiveness for decades to come.</p>
            <p>In order to support the design, development, deployment, and operations of the advanced wireless research platforms, the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) will support the work of a PAWR Project Office (PPO). Working closely with the wireless research community, the PPO will assume responsibility for design, development, and deployment of a set of advanced wireless research platforms. Upon successful completion of the design of advanced wireless research platforms, and contingent upon support from NSF management, the PPO will proceed to the development and deployment phases with funding provided by NSF as well as a PAWR Industry Consortium. Upon successful deployment of each individual research platform, the PPO may subsequently operate the platform in service to the wireless research community.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Wireless communication networks and applications have evolved to become a vital part of the nation&rsquo;s economic growth and productivity. The number of smartphones, connected tablets, and wearable devices in use across the US today has doubled over the last decade (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ctia-survey-2015.pdf">CTIA Wireless Industry Survey, 2015</a>). The burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to add several billions of connected devices worldwide within the next 5 years (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html">Cisco VNI, 2015</a>). Devices will also continue to consume ever-greater amounts of data &ndash; traffic in North America is expected to continue to grow at a 42% Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) through 2020 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html">Cisco VNI, 2015</a>). In order to support this unparalleled growth in devices and traffic, ubiquitous wireless connectivity at speeds covering the range from megabits per second (Mb/s) to gigabits per second (Gb/s) and with improvements in coverage, reliability, and latency will be required. Conventional 4G LTE  (Long-Term Evolution) networks and public WiFi networks may not be able to meet these requirements. Consequently, wireless carriers, device and equipment vendors, and others around the world are looking towards the next generation of wireless technologies (popularly called &lsquo;5G&rsquo;) and beyond, and policy makers are attempting to liberate more spectrum for wireless broadband applications.</p>
          <p>In past generations of wireless technologies (e.g., 3G, 4G, WiFi), academic research in the US laid the foundations for the underlying technology [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)].  NSF played a key role in these developments, through its long history of funding the development of advanced networking technologies. Continuing this trend of research investments, NSF has in recent years supported fundamental research in Massive MIMO, full-duplex wireless, millimeter-wave networks, dynamic spectrum sharing, network virtualization, emergent wireless network architectures, software-defined cognitive radios, wideband antennas, and dynamic tunable filters&mdash;all of which have been touted as critical components of the emerging standards in wireless technologies for both local- and wide-area networks.</p>
          <p>Research in these topics has offered promising preliminary results in theory, simulations, and lab-scale prototypes of very small numbers of advanced wireless nodes. However, due to a lack of appropriately-sized resources available to the academic research community, it has been challenging to test these preliminary results at scale.</p>
          <p>Therefore, NSF, in collaboration with a range of partners, intends to support at-scale experimental platforms for advancing fundamental wireless research. Through a public-private partnership, these research platforms will enable pursuit of new research challenges, enhance education about wireless technologies and data networking, further academic-industry cooperative partnerships, and spur greater technology transfer from academia to industry.</p>
          <p>The proposed national experimental research platforms will accelerate US research and maintain US global leadership in developing the next round of technological innovation within the wireless industry and associated services. The goal of these platforms is to support cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary experimental research on core wireless topics including, but not limited to, cloud-enabled radio access networks, radio and network protocols, antenna designs, software-defined radio transceivers, resource-sharing algorithms, spectrum sharing, use of millimeter-wave spectrum bands for mobile applications, wireless network security, network planning, heterogeneous network architectures, end-to-end network quality of service (QoS), spectrum policy enforcement, end-user application performance, and spectrum data analytics and adaptability. These platforms can also provide opportunities to validate foundational studies from the information-theory communities on wireless channels and network modeling. Importantly, these platforms for wireless research will enable innovation over the next decade and beyond, furthering the capacity of the academic research community to help envision and shape next-generation wireless communication networks beyond &lsquo;5G&rsquo;.</p>
          <p>Several companies within the wireless communication ecosystem have formed a PAWR Industry Consortium that will partner with NSF on the establishment of the PPO and subsequent platforms for wireless research. The PAWR Industry Consortium shares research priorities with NSF, and will provide support within this structure to ensure a focus on relevant research while fostering greater exchange of ideas, resources, and expertise between academia and industry.</p>
          <p>In the long term, these at-scale research platforms will collectively serve as a powerful research and development infrastructure that will support innovation in next-generation technologies giving rise to the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15120/nsf15120.jsp">Smart &amp; Connected Communities (S&amp;CC)</a> of the future. Indeed, the proposed research platforms will benefit a multitude of research and education communities that are supported by ongoing NSF research programs (such as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503307">Networking Technology and Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503300">Communication and Information Foundations</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503306">Computer Systems Research</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503286">Cyber-Physical Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504709">Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504739">Smart and Connected Health</a>). They can be used as platforms for test and demonstration for academic research, aid in transitioning academic research to industry, and provide increased opportunities for educating the next-generation workforce.</p>

        </h3>
         
          <p>In order to formalize the PAWR design, development, and deployment activities, and to ensure the appropriate engagement of organizations and individuals with experience in the planning and management of research infrastructure construction projects, CISE seeks proposals from organizations seeking to serve as the PAWR Project Office (PPO). Proposers should consider the information in this Program Description when preparing submissions.</p>
          <p>Working closely with the wireless research community and the PAWR Industry Consortium, the PPO will assume responsibility for managing all design and development activities essential to prepare for the deployment of the advanced wireless research platforms.</p>
          <p>Upon successful completion of the multiple stages of PAWR design and development activities, and contingent upon support from NSF management, PAWR will proceed to the deployment phase with funding provided by NSF as well as by the PAWR Industry Consortium. It is anticipated that the PPO will then have full responsibility for overseeing the deployment and operations of the PAWR research platforms, ensuring that the wireless research community is able to pursue innovative research that will transform the wireless sector over the next five to fifteen years.</p>
          <p>To ensure that all PAWR activities are driven by fundamental research opportunities in wireless networking, the PPO will work closely with the wireless research community in all aspects of the design, development, deployment, and operations of PAWR. A PAWR Steering Council (PSC), comprising a subset of the PAWR Industry Consortium, as well as research leaders in wireless networking, will represent the community&rsquo;s research interests in PAWR; the PSC will be chartered and supported by the PPO. The role of the PSC will be to advise the PPO in all aspects of the deployment and operations of the advanced wireless research platforms.</p>
          <p><strong>PPO Management</strong></p>
          <p>The successful operation of the PPO will require a dedicated project staff whose expertise includes: a demonstrated ability to work collaboratively with and provide services to the wireless research community; effective management of advanced networking infrastructure projects with a large wireless communication component, including planning, deployment, and operations; effective management of large-scale wireless and software-intensive projects, including design, development, implementation, and lifecycle management; technical report editing and web-based publications; communication and outreach to the broader scientific community and the general public, and interactive website development, usage, and maintenance. </p>
          <p>The lead Principal Investigator (PI) will serve as the &ldquo;Project Director&rdquo; for the PPO and will work full-time on the project; thus, the PI will have direct day-to-day involvement in the effort. The Project Director must have an established track record of leadership and management of teams and projects of this scale and scope; he/she will play a critical role in the success of the project and will thus take overall responsibility for the project. The PPO Project Director will work closely with the cognizant NSF Program Officers and the PAWR Industry Consortium in order to keep all parties informed of PPO activities and to solicit input on aspects related to project planning and implementation. The PPO Project Director will also serve as an <em>ex officio</em> member of the PAWR Steering Council. The PPO Project Director will be assisted by others who bring additional scientific and administrative expertise necessary to the successful execution of PPO responsibilities. Office and meeting facilities must be available, including institutional meeting space necessary to conduct planned activities.</p>
          <p>The PPO will be monitored by an independent evaluation team assigned by NSF, whose role is to work with the PPO to help it meet the requirements of this solicitation, provide NSF with an external independent assessment of PPO activities and progress, and collect NSF-required performance data. The PPO will be required to provide all necessary data and materials to the evaluators in a timely fashion, in order to enable the evaluators to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
          <p><strong>PAWR Design and Development Phase: Identifying Advanced Wireless Research Platforms</strong></p>
          <p>In conjunction with the PAWR Industry Consortium, the PPO will develop a Request for Proposals (RFP) calling for the development of no more than <strong>four </strong>advanced experimental wireless research platforms across the country. The RFP will articulate the desired capabilities of these research platforms; the contributions that the PAWR Industry Consortium will offer to all selected awardees of the RFP; and the deployment and operational support and oversight that the PPO and the PAWR Steering Council will provide to the selected awardees. The PPO will also identify NSF deployment requirements (identified under &ldquo;PAWR Design and Development Phase: Pre-Deployment Requirements&rdquo; below) and solicit appropriate documentation relating to these requirements from the proposers as part of the RFP process.</p>
          <p>The PPO will issue the initial RFP within six months of its establishment (i.e., within six months of receipt of NSF funding). The PPO will advertise the RFP throughout the wireless research community, following up with extensive outreach efforts to the various stakeholder communities, explaining the key aspects of the RFP. In response to the changing membership of the PAWR Industry Consortium and the corresponding contributions from Consortium members, the PPO will re-issue the RFP annually on an as-needed basis to reflect the nature of the contributions from the Industry Consortium. It is anticipated that the PPO will have annual deadlines for submission for the first three years.</p>
          <p>Once the PPO receives proposals in response to the RFP, it is expected to run a merit review process, comparable to that of NSF, to evaluate the submitted proposals. While the selection of suitable proposals and topics may span multiple years, it is anticipated that, across the multiple research platforms selected by the PPO, most or all of the research thrusts of interest to NSF (see below) will be enabled.</p>
          <p>The advanced wireless research platforms should support a diverse community of investigators across the country, in both academia and industry, in the wireless communication and networking space. Each research platform is expected to support one or more research thrusts upon deployment. Examples of anticipated research thrusts include:</p>
          <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li>Dynamic Wireless Spectrum Use: This thrust seeks to identify spectral usage patterns and opportunities based on existing wireless spectrum allocations, establish usage models for novel spectrum-driven applications, study co-existence and protection issues, test innovative sharing models, and demonstrate the potential for per-device wireless throughput approaching several gigabits per second using consumer-grade devices.</li>
            <li>Millimeter Wave (mmWave) Spectrum Use: This thrust seeks to design devices, communication modalities, and effective network systems that can leverage the mmWave bands that are between 30 gigahertz (GHz) and 300 GHz, with a target of 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) in data rates for small-cell networks that cover a few city blocks.</li>
            <li>Network Architecture: This thrust seeks to develop and demonstrate novel, programmable, and flexible data network architectures that leverage advanced Radio Frequency (RF) capabilities to enable high-performance applications for next-generation networks that operate with a wireless edge. This thrust should address: (a) mobility in the physical/network/application domains, from the transport to MAC layers; and (b) issues facing large-scale, dense, heterogeneous wireless networks, such as connection management, load balancing, mobility management, and Quality of Experience (QoE).</li>
            <li>Wide-Area Wireless Backhaul: This thrust seeks to enhance rural broadband connectivity by utilizing novel wireless communication techniques, such as beamforming, dynamic spectrum, whitespaces, etc., to achieve over 1 Gbps connectivity over 50 mile-long links in order to connect remote locations via long-range wireless mesh connections.</li>
            <li>Network Metrology: This research thrust seeks to advance capabilities to measure and monitor wireless network performance in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and QoE. These capabilities must also support research on methods to improve the security, reliability and performance of wireless networks that can range from local-area networks to wide-area cellular networks and on to wireless-backhaul/satellite link-based networks.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The PPO will conduct a merit review process on an annual basis for identifying suitable platforms for advanced wireless research supporting a subset of the thrusts identified above. The awardees of the RFP should be selected based on the merit review process, in consultation with NSF and the PAWR Industry Consortium. Selected awardees of the RFP will be sub-awardees of the PPO.</p>
          <p><strong>PAWR Design and Development Phase: Pre-Deployment Requirements</strong></p>
          <p>The PPO shall work closely with the sub-awardee organization(s) to support the design, development, deployment, and operations of the corresponding research platforms. The PPO shall provide common guidelines, management structures, and operational interfaces (including modes of access to the research platforms, infrastructure test and validation procedures, equipment upgrade processes, and software design guidelines) across all of these research platforms.</p>
          <p>After each round of merit review (once the PPO identifies potential awardees for a wireless research platform), the PPO must take the following steps prior to deployment, constituting the final design baseline for that advanced wireless research platform:</p>
          <ul type="circle">
            <li>Submit a deployment-ready research platform execution plan;</li>
            <li>Submit a deployment-ready PAWR research platform design, specifications, and scope of work;</li>
            <li>Finalize a detailed deployment plan with a bottom-up cost estimate and contingency calculations linked to risk assessment;</li>
            <li>Submit a detailed plan for technical and financial status reporting; </li>
            <li>Demonstrate successful development and prototyping of technologies essential to the platform;</li>
            <li>Finalize change control processes;</li>
            <li>Finalize a risk analysis and mitigation plan, including a security plan that protects PAWR from malicious attack or malevolent use;</li>
            <li>Finalize processes essential to robust software design, development and management throughout the life-cycle;</li>
            <li>Finalize annual operations and maintenance costs;</li>
            <li>Finalize the intellectual property model;</li>
            <li>Create the core management organization responsible for the overall deployment of the wireless research platform and finalize the staffing plan for additional staff needed to support the deployment and initial operations effort;</li>
            <li>Finalize commitments with academic, industry, inter-agency and international partners; and</li>
            <li>Establish a final baseline.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>PAWR Deployment Phase and Initial Operations</strong></p>
          <p>Upon approval of the final design baseline for each advanced wireless research platform by NSF, PAWR deployment activities will begin for that platform.</p>
          <p>Contingent upon the successful performance of the PPO during the design stages, it is expected that the PPO will assume all responsibility for PAWR deployment and operations. <em>Separate subawards will be issued by the PPO for PAWR deployment and operations for each advanced wireless research platform. </em>NSF will provide guidance to the PPO on each advanced wireless platform deployment and operations as that platform progresses through its lifecycle. </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
  
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
            <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
      
        <p><strong>In consideration of a proposal&rsquo;s Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts, the following review criteria will guide the reviewers&rsquo; evaluation:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Comment on the capabilities of the proposing team. Does the proposing team demonstrate strong experience&mdash;managerial, technical, and administrative&mdash;in projects similar in scope to that proposed here? Do prior contributions provide convincing evidence that the proposers understand and are prepared to handle the major challenges of this project? Does the proposing team have experience working with the wireless research community, deploying wireless infrastructure, and running large, software-intensive projects?</li>
          <li>Do the goals, milestones, and activities proposed in the Project Development Plan cover all the essential aspects of PAWR design and development?</li>
          <li>Does the submitting organization provide a reasonable plan for risk mitigation?  Are some foreseeable risks not adequately addressed?</li>
          <li>Does the project schedule appear reasonable? Were the key milestones identified?</li>
          <li>Does the submitting organization provide an adequate management plan? Is the managerial, organizational, and governance approach appropriate for an effective PPO? Is the proposed competitive bidding process for establishing these platforms open and consistent with NSF&rsquo;s established review process?</li>
        </ul>

         <h4>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Site Visit Review, Reverse Site Review, or Internal Review by the PAWR Industry Consortium.
        </p>

  
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
   
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
         <h4>
         C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>The PPO will be monitored by an independent evaluation team assigned by NSF, whose role will be to work with the PPO and help it adhere to the requirements of this solicitation, provide NSF with an external independent assessment of PPO activities and progress, and collect NSF-required performance data on a biannual basis. The PPO is required to provide all necessary data and materials to the evaluation team in a timely fashion, in order to enable the evaluators to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The activities of the PAWR Project Office will also be monitored through quarterly interim progress reports. In lieu of a fourth-quarter report, an annual report on progress and plans will be submitted by the awardee to the cognizant NSF Program Officers. NSF will provide the format for these reports within one month of the award date. Both quarterly and annual reports must address progress of the PAWR Project Office regarding the duties outlined in this solicitation. If a Grantee-Approved No-Cost Extension to the project is exercised by the awardee organization, prior notification shall be provided to the cognizant Program Officers at least 60 days prior to such activity, and an interim annual report should be submitted along with said notification.</p>
        <p>Once the PPO is selected, a site visit will be conducted. At a minimum, the PPO team, other NSF staff as needed, and an external peer review team will conduct annual site visits. The PPO team members will travel to NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA, for a mid-year briefing with NSF.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
