        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the<br>
        MATH AND SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP (MSP) &#8211; NSF 02-190</h2>
      <p>The new MSP program has generated much enthusiasm around the country. 
        The official guidelines for submission of MSP proposals can be found in 
        the Program Solicitation NSF 02-190 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02190/nsf02190.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02190/nsf02190.htm</a>). 
        Step-by-step submission instructions are also available at this site. 
        The following questions and answers are intended to be helpful supplements 
        to the program guidelines, and have been generated at recent workshops 
        and through communications with the MSP Cognizant Program Officers.</p>
      <p>As additional questions are raised, please continue to review these FAQs 
        as they will be updated on a regular basis.</p>

      <h3 align="center">General MSP Questions</h3>
      <p><strong> Question &#8211; Discussions of the two merit review criteria, 
        intellectual merit and broader impact of the proposed activity, are woven 
        throughout our proposal. Is that sufficient?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; No. The Program Solicitation NSF 02-190 
        (under Section V. PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, A. 
        Proposal Preparation Instructions, Project Summary) states: &#8220;Note 
        that the abstract MUST address both NSB-approved merit criteria in separate 
        statements. Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review 
        proposals that do not address both merit review criteria in separate statements.&#8221; 
        Partnerships are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to submit relevant information on 
        the (single) Project Summary page in three sections, clearly labeled as: 
        Abstract, Intellectual Merit Criterion, and Broader Impacts Criterion. 
        Further clarification of what is entailed in the merit review criteria 
        can be found in Section VI, PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION, of the MSP Solicitation 
        and in NSF&#8217;s <strong>Grant Proposal Guide</strong>.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; How does the MSP differ from NSF programs of 
        the past decade?</strong></p>
      <p>Answer &#8211; The MSP requires that mathematicians, scientists and engineers 
        from institutions of higher education participate fully in the improvement 
        of K-12 mathematics and science education. In all cases MSP proposals 
        must demonstrate commitments among school districts, institutions of higher 
        education, and other partners. Partnership models will be extensively 
        studied to learn how partners&#8217; commitments result in institutional 
        changes that will lead to scalability and sustainability of their efforts. 
        The MSP program expects to learn and share how the partnerships contribute 
        to a national capacity for success in educational reform.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; Will there be another round of proposals for 
        the MSP after the January 7, 2003 deadline?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; When initially conceived, it was anticipated 
        that the MSP program would receive funding from Congress each year for 
        five years. If Congress appropriates funding consistent with this timeline, 
        then we anticipate MSP competitions for Comprehensive and Targeted proposals 
        after the January 7, 2003 submission deadline. In addition we anticipate 
        two other competitions in FY 2003, for the MSP Research, Evaluation, and 
        Technical Assistance (RETA) component and for MSP Teacher Institutes. 
        Details are forthcoming.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; What is a Cooperative Agreement (indicated in 
        the Solicitation under the description for Comprehensive awards)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; A cooperative agreement is very similar 
        to a contract and includes explicit benchmarks and deliverables on a yearly 
        basis throughout the lifespan of an award. Cooperative agreements will 
        be negotiated with each partnership that receives a Comprehensive award. 
        This step follows the review process and commitment to accept the award 
        by a partnership.</p>
      <p><strong>Question &#8211; Under Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions, 
        B. Budgetary Information, the following statement appears: &quot;Indirect 
        cost (F&amp;A) Limitations: Not Applicable&quot;. Does this mean that 
        there are no limitations on indirect costs other than the rate negotiated 
        by an organization with the cognizant Federal negotiating agency? Or, 
        does this mean that indirect costs are not applicable to this solicitation?</strong></p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; It means that there are no limitations 
        on indirect costs other than the rate negotiated by an organization with 
        the cognizant Federal negotiating agency. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; Do we need to send a Letter of Intent before 
        submitting a proposal? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; No, however, partnerships are STRONGLY 
        ENCOURAGED to enter specific information about their projects into the 
        MSP Data Registry. Details can be found in the Program Solicitation under 
        section V. PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, A. Proposal 
        Preparation Instructions. The registry can be accessed at <a href="http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/msp/msppartner/">http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/msp/msppartner/</a> 
        . Information entered into the registry can be modified until the time 
        of proposal submission on or before January 7, 2003.</p>

      <h3 align="center"> Eligibility Rules</h3>
      <p><strong> Question &#8211; Can my institution be the lead organization 
        on proposals for both a Comprehensive and a Targeted Award?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; A single institution can be the <em><strong>lead 
        on only one</strong></em> proposal. The lead is defined as the institution 
        that submits the proposal, acts as the fiscal agent and is responsible 
        for overall management of the proposed project. An institution may participate 
        in more than one partnership proposal. However, a school district can 
        participate in no more than two proposal submissions of which no more 
        than one can be for a Comprehensive award.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples</strong> &#8211; </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p><em> An institution of higher education in which two departments 
            in a college want to participate in separate proposals with different 
            partners</em>. This is allowed, but the college can be the lead organization 
            on only one of the proposals; the departments must negotiate with 
            each other on which proposal would have their college as the lead. 
            For the other proposal, the department and college would be a partner 
            with some other organization acting as the lead. <strong><em>A cautionary 
            note:</em></strong> Institutional change within colleges and universities 
            participating in the MSP is one of the expected outcomes when an institution 
            is a Core partner in a proposal. When there are multiple efforts involving 
            different departments/units of an institution of higher education, 
            care must be taken to ensure a common model of change to which all 
            parties will commit.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <em>A school district would like to work on a mathematics proposal 
            with one set of partners and a science one with other partners.</em> 
            This is permitted, as long as only one proposal is for a Comprehensive 
            award (or if both proposals are for Targeted awards). </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><em> A state educational agency submits a proposal involving school 
            districts and institutions of higher education.</em> This is allowable 
            and the state educational agency, as a Core partner, must demonstrate 
            commitment to institutional change. However, at least one institution 
            of higher education and at least one school district would also have 
            to be Core partners in order to meet eligibility requirements of MSP 
            Solicitation NSF 02-190. <br>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Question &#8211; Is a school district that received funding from 
        the first round of proposals now excluded from involvement and partnership 
        in all subsequent proposals?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Solicitation NSF 02-190 does not put 
        any restrictions on currently funded school districts. However, the onus 
        will be on the Partners of a proposal involving a currently funded school 
        district to provide compelling rationale and documentation for the need 
        for this proposal given the currently funded endeavor and the relationship 
        of the proposed effort to the funded endeavor. In the case of a school 
        district that has received funding for a Comprehensive MSP under Solicitation 
        NSF 02-061, which means that K-12 mathematics AND science are being addressed, 
        this rationale and documentation would need to be convincing.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; Our partnership will have many partners. Should 
        we provide information within the body of the proposal on all partners? 
        And what about the Supplementary Documentation? If we include a letter 
        of commitment from all core partners we will already exceed the 40-page 
        limit. And that's before attaching baseline data and the other required 
        documentation. What should we do?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211;</p>
      <ol start="1" type="i">
        <li> 
          <p> You should provide information on each entity that will share in 
            the goals, the responsibility, and the accountability of the project. 
            You should also discuss the identified intended institutional change 
            for each Core partner. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>When there are several partners with common commitments, they can 
            sign-off on ONE letter of commitment, but the letter should contain 
            description of substantive commitments. As for the baseline data on 
            students and teachers, it is up to the Partnership to gather the necessary 
            data and to present the (disaggregated) data in a coherent fashion. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, it is a Partnership decision as to what must be placed 
            in the Supplementary Documentation. All proposals submitted, regardless 
            of size of Partnerships, will be held to the same page limitations.

      <h3 align="center">Project Requirements</h3>
      <p><strong> Question &#8211; In a proposal for a Comprehensive award, do 
        we have to work on issues of both mathematics and science education?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; No. You may submit a proposal for a Comprehensive 
        award that address K-12 science (amounts awarded will be up to $4 million/year), 
        K-12 mathematics (up to $4 million/year), or both K-12 mathematics and 
        K-12 science (up to $7 million/year).</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; May a partnership submit a proposal for a Targeted 
        award that is K-12 Mathematics and/or Science?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; By definition, a project that covers 
        K-12 mathematics and science, or K-12 mathematics, or K-12 science, is 
        a Comprehensive project. Targeted projects are intended to have specific 
        grade level and/or content focus. For example, a project addressing geometry 
        in K-12 would be appropriate as a proposal for a Targeted award. Similarly, 
        a project focusing on just grades 6-8 or grades 5-9, etc., would be appropriate 
        as a proposal for a Targeted award.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Question &#8211; The Program Description states, &quot;the MSP 
        program seeks to improve K-12 achievement through a sharp focus on three 
        interrelated areas&#8230;&quot; Is it important to address all three (3) 
        areas in a Targeted project? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Yes, regardless of whether the proposal 
        is for a Comprehensive or Targeted award, the three interrelated issues 
        should be addressed. In a Targeted project, partnerships will address 
        student achievement gains in a specific grade range and/or within a content 
        emphasis.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong> Question &#8211; What are the &#8220;challenging curricula,&#8221; 
        discussed in the Program Solicitation, which MSP programs should utilize? 
        What is the expectation for inclusion of NSF-funded curricula in MSP projects?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211;There is no intent on the part of NSF 
        to designate or proscribe a specific curriculum in schools, as curricular 
        decisions are viewed by NSF as a local or state decision-making process. 
        Partnerships are expected to evaluate the relevant literature on high 
        expectations for all K-16 students and to make decisions consistent with 
        state mathematics and science student academic achievement standards. 
        MSP projects must start with disaggregated data indicating which students 
        are in which courses and develop benchmarks indicating how partnership 
        activities will lead to all students being engaged in challenging curricula 
        that promote the development of increasingly sophisticated levels of problem-solving 
        and critical thinking and reasoning skills in mathematics and science, 
        as well as increased student participation and success in advanced coursework. 
        Students&#8217; curricular options and assessments should parallel the 
        benchmarks that are developed, as should support of the teacher workforce. 
        Ultimately, partnerships must utilize evidence for K-12 student achievement 
        in the selection of materials for use in schools, as well as in teacher 
        education and professional development programs.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; Must all of the proposed work be new development 
        and design or can the work be centered on existing proven initiatives?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; The MSP is not meant to replace, continue 
        or supplement previous efforts funded under other NSF programs or other 
        funding sources. A proposal for funding through the MSP may be based on 
        prior work that demonstrates credible evidence of success. Beyond simply 
        building on effective programs that have been funded in the past, the 
        MSP seeks to support strong partnerships that will result in increased 
        student achievement while also stimulating new, innovative solutions to 
        issues in mathematics and science education. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Question &#8211; Do projects have to impact at least 10,000 students?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; The figure &#8220;10,000 students or 
        more&#8221; is identified as a guideline only and indicates that the scale 
        of the partnership, i.e., the number of students and/or teachers impacted 
        by the project, is one factor in the strength of a proposal. This guideline 
        is not meant to stifle innovation nor exclude sparsely populated areas 
        from participating. However, as noted in the Solicitation, projects that 
        incur high costs but which impact small numbers of students and teachers 
        typically do not hold as much promise for broad dissemination as more 
        cost-effective approaches. All costs must be well justified in the Budget 
        Justification and must directly correlate with the scope, complexity and 
        scale of the proposed project. </p>
