<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) requests proposals from interested groups to support current and future continental scientific drilling activities. We request proposals for the establishment of a <em>Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office</em> (CSDCO) that will help coordinate planning for continental scientific drilling projects, in collaboration with the Earth science community, and will have the capability to supply continental scientific drilling support and expertise for NSF-funded research. </p><p>The CSDCO may work with the commercial drilling community or other drilling organizations to determine the type and availability of drilling services that may be available for NSF-funded scientific projects that require continental drilling. The CSDCO, if requested by the PI of the scientific project, may assist with the development of requests for bids to provide the drilling services. The CSDCO is expected to play a proactive role in the community to encourage innovation in drilling technologies and methods in response to community needs and will help guide the development of new drilling designs as requested by the research community. </p>    <p>The successful proponent will be expected to manage drilling activities for the US scientific community, as needed. Requirements for drilling activities will be derived both from long-range science plans developed by the community as well as research proposals funded by NSF. We encourage collaborations with international partners such as the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) and with scientists funded by other sources. The CSDCO will be capable of assisting in the planning and execution of all aspects of the drilling activities that EAR supports.</p><p>Interested parties must propose to this solicitation with a plan to provide for these services under a single award. The CSDCO award will be administered as a Cooperative Agreement with an anticipated duration of up to five-years beginning on October 1, 2013. A mid-term management review will be required, which will guide a decision to re-compete or renew the Cooperative Agreement for up to a further five-year period.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Continental scientific drilling (CSD) is a tool to access Earth's geologic history, properties, and processes at locations where such information may otherwise not be available. Data from samples and measurements obtained through scientific drilling provide key parameters that allow researchers to address questions with relevance to society as well as to other fields beyond the Earth Sciences.</p> <p>The importance of scientific drilling has been identified by numerous recent National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council reports (<em>e.g., </em><em>Understanding Earth's Deep Past</em>, 2011;     <em>New Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences</em>, 2012). CSD is an essential element to addressing scientific grand challenges related to global and environmental change, geodynamics, and natural resource systems and concerns. Data obtained from CSD efforts give researchers the opportunity to test and develop hypotheses that are based on observations made elsewhere. CSD enables the science community to develop models that are of global reach and with high spatial and temporal resolution.</p> <p>The drilling community is intellectually diverse, reflecting the many applications of drilling as a tool to addressing key scientific questions. Recent projects have yielded critical information and understanding about climate change, sea level fluctuations, hotspot volcanism, ice dynamics, active tectonics, and human-climate interactions. High resolution lake core records from the tropics to higher latitudes have revealed important information about climate history and dynamics (monsoonal circulation, solar variability, heterogeneity of system response, drought as a mechanism of human migration and development, and teleconnectivity between continental systems) in near and deep time. Multi-platform drilling on the near continental shelf has allowed Earth scientists to better understand critical transitions and thresholds in Earth-life systems in geologic time. Drilling into continental hotspots has allowed researchers to better characterize the nature of deep mantle plumes and investigate potential geothermal resources related to hotspot activity. These examples coupled with newly emerging drilling needs for earthquake and volcanic hazard assessment, geothermal activity, critical zone processes as well as Earth-life interactions, demonstrate the necessity for a strong and responsive scientific drilling capability. </p> <p>The success of scientific drilling in the United States, and on U.S.-involved international projects, is dependent on the leadership of a strong CSDCO. The CSDCO organization must have the financial and managerial capacity and expertise to monitor an NSF Cooperative Agreement. A successful CSDCO is needed to identify new capabilities and technologies; to establish and manage the CSD planning process; and to create a structure to facilitate and enable the community and its CSD activities, including education and public outreach activities. </p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p><strong>Statement of Work</strong></p><p>The Division of Earth Sciences at the National Science Foundation requests proposals for the establishment of a <em>Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office</em>, an organization that will provide scientific leadership and oversight of CSD activities funded by NSF. The successful awardee must demonstrate an in-depth understanding of current, state-of-the-art drilling technologies for recovery of rock, regolith, sediment, and soil cores and must demonstrate the ability to successfully manage drilling activities for the scientific community as needed. The awardee organization must also demonstrate the ability to successfully manage and monitor an NSF Cooperative Agreement.</p><p>The CSDCO will play a proactive role in the community to encourage innovation in scientific drilling, coring and downhole sampling technologies in response to community needs and will help to develop new designs as requested by the research community. Requirements for drilling activities and development of new drilling, coring and downhole sampling tools will, to a large degree, be derived from research activities funded by NSF (including activities with international partners). However, the successful awardee will also be expected to work closely with the community to develop cutting edge scientific drilling, coring and downhole sampling technologies and methods and shall partner, when appropriate, with scientists on the submission of proposals seeking funding for these developments. The successful group will be required to work closely with investigators, other agencies, contractors, and other national programs to prepare operational plans to support CSD activities worldwide, including providing detailed schedules, budgets, and resource requirements for PI-driven projects proposed to NSF.  <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:Cambria; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:auto; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-parent:""; 	margin:0in; 	margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} --></p><p>If NSF determines that a scientific drilling project is supportable, then the CSDCO may be formally directed by NSF, if requested by the PI of the scientific drilling project, to devote resources to manage the work described in the successful proposal via commercial drilling operators or other drilling organizations.&nbsp; These drilling activities may be supported via funding supplementary funds to the scientific drilling project and may be sub-contracted or sub-awarded to the selected drilling organization.</p><p>The awardee will prepare, and annually update, a comprehensive five-year plan for CSD development and use necessary to support the U.S. research community.&nbsp; This plan will include drill allocation to specific projects to the degree that these commitments are known and can be estimated.&nbsp; To develop this document, the awardee will interact closely with the research community, NSF Program Managers, developers of drill core instrumentation and downhole geophysical logging tools, and relevant industry partners. </p><p><strong>Primary Tasks</strong> </p><p>The sections below outline primary activities to be carried out by the <em>Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office</em> (CSDCO). This list is not comprehensive but is provided to enable proposers to formulate their management concepts and organizational structure. &nbsp;</p><p>The CSDCO will play a proactive role in the community to encourage innovation in scientific drilling, coring and downhole sampling technologies in response to community needs. To that end, the following tasks will be essential to the operation of the office:</p><ul><li>Provide community leadership in continental scientific drilling research and development</li><li>Ensure that an efficient and effective project governing structure is in place throughout the award period to support all CSDCO activities.&nbsp; This structure will be designed to ensure close involvement of the research community in the development of CSDCO capabilities, to focus scientific talent on common objectives, and to encourage broad participation.</li><li>Establish appropriate community advisory and working groups to develop long-range scientific plans for continental scientific drilling</li><li>Act as a focal point for community input related to continental scientific drilling research and drilling activities</li><li>Develop plans for appropriate scientific workshops and conferences related to continental scientific drilling </li><li>Provide a clearinghouse for information related to continental scientific drilling research and development as a service to the research community</li><li>Coordinate information exchange between the U.S. continental scientific drilling community and international groups, including ICDP</li><li>Support pre-drilling activities that will strengthen a science proposal that requires CSD and is intended for submission to one of EAR's science programs.&nbsp; These activities could include community planning meetings, site surveys, equipment design, and drilling plan and budget preparation.</li><li>Provide scientific direction and oversight of drilling projects funded by EAR that will be carried out by an entity capable of providing the necessary drilling services and with the business and financial capability to receive federal funding </li><li>Develop a website that describes current drilling capabilities that are available and are of use in continental scientific drilling, with examples of recent activities, as well as detailed conceptual descriptions of future drilling systems</li><li>Develop a drilling educational component for university level students, including support for summer internships at CSDCO or at an active drilling project, and support for drilling projects by students using shallow drilling equipment.</li></ul><p>In addition to the items above, proponents must describe the administrative, scientific, and technical staff required; the available office environment; and any leveraged support services needed to ensure success of the <em>Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office</em>.&nbsp; Proposals should clearly present the management structure, capability, experience and qualifications of&nbsp;the Organization(s)&nbsp;necessary to carry out the CSDCO tasks.&nbsp; Explain the roles and responsibilities of each known or planned team entity (including Key Personnel), the basis for its inclusion, and how it best contributes to accomplishing continental scientific drilling objectives.&nbsp; The proposers must demonstrate a knowledge of and the ability to interact with the academic research community engaged in CSD.&nbsp; The awardee organization must also demonstrate the ability to successfully manage and monitor an NSF Cooperative Agreement.</p></p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p></a>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p><p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>.</p><p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities. </p><p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives. </p><p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4><p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p><p>1. Merit Review Principles</p><p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p><ul><li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge. </li><li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified. </li><li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li></ul><p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p><p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p><p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p><p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and </li><li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li></ul><p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p><ol><li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to <ol type="a"><li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li><li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li></ol></li><li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li><li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?&nbsp; Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li><li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li><li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li></ol><p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.&nbsp; NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.&nbsp; Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p><p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p><p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes reportwill delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p><p>  	      In additional to the annual report, the awardee will also submit an annual Program Plan and Budget in advance of the  next funding increment for the upcoming fiscal year of support of the CSDCO. </p><p>The awardee will prepare, and annually update, a comprehensive five-year  plan for CSD development and use necessary to support the U.S. research  community. This plan will include drill allocation to specific  projects to the degree that these commitments are known and can be  estimated. To develop this document, the awardee will interact closely  with the research community, NSF Program Managers, developers of drill  core instrumentation and downhole geophysical logging tools, and  relevant industry partners. </p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations.

<p><p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p><p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
