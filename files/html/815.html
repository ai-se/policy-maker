          <LI><b>I am a little unsure of the difference between the Leadership

            clarification?</b></LI>
        </OL> 
<OL TYPE="A">
<P><LI>To a certain extent, it's a matter of scale. The Institutional Transformation awards require cost sharing, evaluation mechanisms, and negotiation with NSF. The expectation is that institutions receiving these awards will initiate and sustain organizational change. These are likely to be large, complex efforts. The Leadership awards are probably most appropriate for smaller-scale efforts, or for use by an individual or organization that has developed some "home grown" programs that need funding to scale-up and institutionalize.</LI></OL>

            fields". How does NSF determine the fields in which women are underrepresented? 
            Will preference be given to women in certain fields over others?</b></LI>
        </OL>
<OL TYPE="A">
<P>
          <LI>NSF has responsibility for collecting data about participation in 
            science and engineering and regularly publishes those statistics (see 
            <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm</a>). 
            While there is considerable variation by field in terms of women's 
            participation and advancement to senior positions, NSF recognizes 
            that gains need to be made in all fields. The ADVANCE Program is open 
            to applicants in all fields of science and engineering supported by 
            the Foundation (including the life, social, and behavioral sciences) 
            without any apriorii preference for any field over another.</LI>

<OL TYPE="A">
<P><LI> An "integrated approach" unites several ideas and practices so as to enhance the potential for demonstrable and sustainable change. Proposals should be grounded in the existing literature regarding organizational change and diversity, and include input from a variety of institutional departments and from people at various levels of the administration.</LI></OL>

          <P>
          <LI>A proposal may include more than one school of the University, and may include schools that do not award degrees in an NSF-supported field. It is important to remember in preparing your proposal that the goal of ADVANCE is specific to advancing women in science and engineering and proposals will be evaluated with that in mind. As institutional transformation effects change in other fields as well, so much the better.</LI></OL>

          <LI>NSF, in general, does not support work in the biomedical 
            fields. For clarification, check the Grant Proposal Guide (<A HREF="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf012/nsf0102_1.html">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf012/nsf0102_1.html)</A>, 
            which specifies that research with disease-related goals, including 
            work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental 
            disease, abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or animals, is 
            normally not supported. Animal models of such conditions or the development 
            or testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also are 
            not eligible for support. However, research in bioengineering, with 
            diagnosis or treatment-related goals that applies engineering principles 
            to problems in biology and medicine while advancing engineering knowledge 
            is eligible for support. Bioengineering research to aid persons with 
            disabilities also is eligible. 
			
          <P>Given this context, schools that award only professional degrees 
            (MD, DMD) would generally not be eligible; schools awarding PhDs or 
            MS degrees in science and engineering fields supported by NSF in the 
            biomedical sciences would be eligible. <B>&nbsp;</b></LI></OL>

<OL TYPE="A">
          <P>
          <LI>The PI should be the person most likely to effect change. There

is no expectation or requirement that the PI is in a senior administrative

position. There is an expectation that the institution will support the PI in

his/her efforts, and that commitment might well come from a provost or

president.</LI> </OL>

        </OL>



<OL TYPE="A">
          <P>
          <LI>There are no restrictions in terms of rank, type of position, etc. The main issue is whether the PI has the ability to effect change at the institution. Faculty members who do not also hold administrative positions (dean, chair, etc.) are eligible, as are people who hold dean, chair, and provost positions. Evaluators will look at the "standing" of the PI on this issue and determine how well the PI is equipped to organize and bring about change.</LI> </OL>

          <LI>ADVANCE is targeted at moving women up in the ranks of science and engineering faculty through transformation of institutional culture, practices and policies that inhibit the full participation and advancement of women faculty. Many of the activities that support that goal involve consideration of various aspects of faculty life that affect an individual’s productivity and contributions as valued members of departments. Since the focus of this part of the program is on academic faculty, activities that enhance the participation of women students in science and engineering may be included in proposals, but should not be the primary or major focus of proposals.

          <LI>Proposals involving partnerships among institutions are welcome. Such proposals should address how the project will be managed to ensure that the partner institutions all participate in making the changes necessary to institutional policies and practices to support sustainable organizational change, and should provide evidence of leadership support at each institution. The value added of using a multi-institutional approach should be clearly articulated. </LI></OL>
