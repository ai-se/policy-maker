        <li><a href="#q2">What  is the best way to gauge whether or not a research and development (R&amp;D)  project is innovative and technically challenging enough to be funded by the  NSF SBIR/STTR program? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q3">What  activities and expenses are appropriate to be funded on a Phase I NSF SBIR/STTR  project? What activities and expenses  are not permitted? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q4">Can  NSF SBIR/STTR fund work on a product that has already been developed? Can the  program fund small businesses to execute their business plan? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q5">Must  Phase I NSF SBIR/STTR proposers submit preliminary data as part of the  proposal? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q6">Are  new small businesses / startup companies appropriate candidates for the NSF  SBIR/STTR program? </a> </li>

        <li><a href="#q8">What  is the expected outcome of a Phase I project? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q9">Is  there a fast-track option to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; to Phase II? Is there an option to apply  for Phase I and Phase II simultaneously? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q10">Are  examples available of recently-funded NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposals and/or  awards? </a> </li>

        <li><a href="#q14">Both NSF  and NIH fund biomedical / health projects through the SBIR/STTR program. How  are the programs different? Can a small business apply to both programs? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q15">May a  small business submit identical or overlapping proposals to NSF SBIR/STTR and  another federal agency? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q16">If a  proposing small business elects to partner with a university or research  institute (and therefore submits a Phase I STTR proposal) must the partner also  be part of that Phase II proposal? </a> </li>

        <li><a href="#q20">Does NSF  SBIR/STTR support non-U.S. companies or work that is performed abroad? <br><br>
        SBIR/STTR  eligibility guidelines state that the majority (more than 50%) of a small  business' equity (e.g. stock) must be directly owned and controlled by one or  more individuals who are citizens or permanent residents of the U.S.  Additionally, NSF SBIR/STTR only supports work that is performed in the U.S.  (including work performed by subawardees and consultants). </a> </li>

        <li><a href="#q25">What is  the <em>NSF Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG)?  Some guidelines in the NSF GPG are not spelled out in the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I  solicitation or conflict with information in the solicitation. Which policy  document should I follow? </a> </li>
        <li><a href="#q26">What are  the rules or restrictions regarding contact with NSF SBIR/STTR Program  Directors? Must a small business form a working relationship with a Program  Director before submitting a proposal? </a> </li>

      <h2>How  Appropriate is NSF SBIR/STTR Funding for a Company/Project?</h2>
      <ol>
      	<li id="q1"><p class="question">What  are the funding priorities for NSF SBIR/STTR?</p>
       	<p>The  NSF SBIR/STTR portfolio is divided into several broad technology areas, which  are listed here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics.jsp</a>. However, this list is NOT  exhaustive. A proposing small business has the freedom to pursue any technology  and market area. NSF SBIR/STTR proposal review does NOT take into account how  well a proposal fits into a topic. Rather, Phase I proposals are evaluated  based on the technical innovation and potential commercial/societal impacts.  (Find the merit review criteria listed here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/peer_review.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/peer_review.jsp</a>.</p>
      	<li id="q2"><p class="question">What  is the best way to gauge whether or not a research and development (R&amp;D)  project is innovative and technically challenging enough to be funded by the NSF  SBIR/STTR program? </p>
  <p>NSF  SBIR/STTR seeks to fund R&amp;D that involves a high degree of technical risk.  It is a good sign if the R&amp;D has never been attempted and/or successfully  done before or is attempting to overcome significant technical hurdles. Innovation  takes many different forms in different fields. If this is a significant  question that will determine whether or not you will submit a proposal, the  best approach is to send an Executive Summary to the relevant NSF SBIR/STTR  Program Director (see <a href="#q17">Question 17</a>) and ask whether the project  seems to meet the technical merit review criteria. </p>
      	<li id="q3"><p class="question">What  activities and expenses are appropriate to be funded on a Phase I NSF SBIR/STTR  project? What activities and expenses are  not permitted?</p>
      	  <p>NSF  SBIR/STTR funding is for R&amp;D only. Generally,  NSF SBIR/STTR funding can be used for salary and wages for company employees,  associated fringe benefits, materials and supplies, and a number of other  direct costs needed to carry out the proposed R&amp;D. As appropriate, NSF SBIR/STTR may also fund  consultants to the project and subawards to partner institutions. Some types of indirect costs that are  necessary for the small business to carry out the project are also appropriate.</p>
        <p>NSF  SBIR/STTR Phase I funds cannot be used for business development, marketing and  sales, production, patent costs, or entertainment. Equipment purchases are not permitted on a  Phase I award (but are permitted in Phase II). Please consult the solicitation  for more information.</p>
      	<li id="q4"><p class="question">Can  NSF SBIR/STTR fund work on a product that has already been developed? Can the  program fund small businesses to execute their business plan? </p>
   	    <p>NSF SBIR/STTR funding  is for R&amp;D only. The aim of a Phase  I project should be to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed  innovation and thereby bring the innovation closer to commercialization. If the  idea has been proven to be technically feasible already and capital is required  simply to perform analytical testing on the product, execute the business plan,  and/or begin manufacturing, the project is <strong>not  a good candidate</strong> for NSF SBIR/STTR funding.  Non-incremental innovations to an existing product might be appropriate if  the innovation will <strong>significantly</strong> enhance commercial outcomes and if the small business must undertake R&amp;D  with a great degree of technical risk in order to make to achieve those  outcomes. Projects that focus on  incremental improvements on existing products will not be funded. </p>
      	<li id="q5"><p class="question">Must  Phase I NSF SBIR/STTR proposers submit preliminary data as part of the proposal?</p>
  <p>Preliminary data is  not required for NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposals. However, in many cases,  preliminary data can strengthen the case that the small business could  demonstrate technical feasibility with the proposed Phase I R&amp;D. </p>
      	<li id="q6"><p class="question">Are  new small businesses / startup companies appropriate candidates for the NSF  SBIR/STTR program?</p>
  <p>NSF encourages  proposals from a diversity of small businesses. In fact, most of NSF SBIR/STTR  Phase I awards are made to companies that are very new and very small. Companies with no current revenues and/or  minimal history of operations are encouraged to apply. However, those small  businesses must show that, if NSF SBIR/STTR funding is awarded, they have a  clear plan to quickly stand up the company operations and bring together a team  that is capable of carrying out the proposed Phase I project.</p>
      	<li id="q7"><p class="question">Are  first-time entrepreneurs appropriate candidates for the NSF SBIR/STTR program?</p>
  <p>NSF encourages  proposals from both new and seasoned entrepreneurs. What is most important is  that the team is committed to bringing the technological innovation to the  market. The lack of a commercialization track record does not disadvantage a  team, as long as the proposers can show a planned path to successful commercial  outcomes. Many NSF SBIR/STTR grantees  are first-time entrepreneurs. </p>
      	<li id="q8"><p class="question">What  is the expected outcome of a Phase I project?</p>
      	  <p>The aim of the Phase  I project should be to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed  innovation and thereby bring the innovation closer to commercialization.  Consequently, a product that is ready for market launch is typically not an  expected outcome of a Phase I project.  The R&amp;D outcomes that can best demonstrate technical feasibility  vary widely based on the technology area and the particulars of the project. </p><p>
      	    The required  deliverable at the end of an SBIR Phase I grant is a report that summarizes the  project&rsquo;s technical accomplishments. Phase I outcomes depend on the technology  area and stage of the research and could be proof-of-concept data, a prototype,  analytical/testing results of the product under development, etc.</p><p>
   	    The R&amp;D undertaken in  Phase I is intended to have high technical risk, and so it  is expected that not all projects will achieve the desired technical outcomes.  However, projects that are successful are in a better position to obtain follow-on  funding, including an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II grant. This is because a Phase I  project should aim to de-risk the technical aspect(s) of the innovation that could  determine future commercial success.</p>
      	<li id="q9"><p class="question">Is  there a fast-track option to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; to Phase II? Is there an option to apply  for Phase I and Phase II simultaneously?</p>
  <p>There is no fast-track  option at NSF. Small businesses must  receive a Phase I award before applying for a Phase II award. </p>
      	<li id="q10"><p class="question">Are  examples available of recently-funded NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposals and/or  awards?</p>
  <p>Companies and  projects funded by NSF SBIR/STTR can be explored on the portfolio page here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/portfolio.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/portfolio.jsp</a>.  Company names and project titles and abstracts for recently funded Phase I  awards in each topic area are provided on the topic webpages that are linked to  from this page: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics.jsp</a>.  NSF SBIR/STTR does not provide sample proposals.</p>
      	<li id="q11"><p class="question">May  a small business submit two different Phase I proposals during the same  submission cycle?</p>
  <p>No.  A small business is only permitted to submit ONE Phase I proposal per cycle. Small  businesses, especially those with limited resources, should focus on submitting  one strong proposal that best aligns with the commercial goals of their  business and the NSF SBIR/STTR program goals. </p>
      	<li id="q12"><p class="question">What  are the chances of receiving an NSF Phase I or Phase II SBIR/STTR award?</p>
  <p>From 2012 to 2016,  for <strong>Phase I</strong>, funding rates varied  from 13 percent to 30 percent. For <strong>Phase  II</strong>, funding rates varied from 30 percent to 54 percent. Although funding  rate is a common question, generally, the answer rarely helps in making a  decision whether or not to submit a proposal. The possibility of receiving an  award increases with the fit of the project for the program and quality of the project  proposed. Proposers are encouraged to ensure that NSF SBIR/STTR is a good fit  for their needs and that the proposed project aligns well with the program  goals.</p>
      	<li id="q13"><p class="question">Can  NSF SBIR/STTR fund work on products whose target customers will be in the  defense industry?</p>
  <p>NSF SBIR/STTR does  not dictate which markets or customers small businesses may serve. However, if  an intended customer for the solution developed under the SBIR/STTR grant will  be the Department of Defense (DOD) or Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), proposers should consider applying through the SBIR/STTR  programs at those respective agencies (DOD- <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/sbir/">http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/sbir/</a>;  DHS- <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/sbir">http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/sbir</a>).  Those agencies, and several others, focus on the acquisition of solutions  developed under the SBIR/STTR program. The  submission of an identical or overlapping proposal to both NSF and another  government agency with an SBIR/STTR program is possible (see Question 14), if a project seems like it could be appropriate  for both NSF and another agency.</p>
      	<li id="q14"><p class="question">Both  NSF and NIH fund biomedical / health projects through the SBIR/STTR program. How  are the programs different? Can a small business apply to both programs? </p>
      	  <p>Generally, NSF  SBIR/STTR funding is not aimed at supporting clinical trials, the clinical  validation of information technologies or medical devices, or studies that are performed  primarily for regulatory purposes. Limited  studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are  performed in support of feasibility, proof-of-concept studies of early-stage  technologies. </p><p>
      	    More  specific guidance on what is funded through NSF SBIR/STTR  in the biomedical and biological technologies spaces can be found on the topic  pages for Smart Health and Biomedical Technologies (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics/BM.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics/BM.jsp</a>)  and Biological Technologies (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics/BT.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics/BT.jsp</a>).  These topics and subtopics are NOT restrictive  but give a general sense of the types of proposals solicited. </p><p>
      	    Another  way to explore what is typically funded under NIH and/or NSF is via the &ldquo;Award Search&rdquo;  at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/">SBIR.gov</a>, which reports on all SBIR/STTR awards, regardless of the  agency under which it was funded.</p><p>
      	    Finally,  the submission of an identical or overlapping proposal to both NSF and NIH  SBIR/STTR is possible (see Question 15).</p><p>
        If  more guidance is necessary to decide whether or not to submit a proposal,  proposers are encouraged to contact the appropriate NSF SBIR/STTR Program  Director (see <a href="#q17">Question  17</a>).</p>
      	<li id="q15"><p class="question">May  a small business submit identical or overlapping proposals to NSF SBIR/STTR and  another federal agency? </p>
      	  <p>Yes, proposers may  submit overlapping proposals to different agencies, but NSF will not make <strong>awards</strong> that duplicate research funded  by, or anticipated to be funded by, other agencies. It is very  important to note potential overlap on the cover page of the NSF proposal. <strong>If a proposer fails to disclose  that another Federal Agency has received this proposal (or an equivalent or  overlapping proposal) on the proposal cover page, the proposer could be liable  for administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions.</strong></p><p>
   	    If a proposal is selected for award, NSF and the other  agency will determine which agency will fund the work. Sometimes, the project  scope and/or budgets will be adjusted if both projects will be funded in order  to ensure that no portion of the work is double-funded. However, NSF SBIR/STTR  will not co-fund a single proposal with any other agency.</p>
      	<li id="q16"><p class="question">If  a proposing small business elects to partner with a university or research  institute (and therefore submits a Phase I STTR proposal) must the partner also  be part of that Phase II proposal?</p>
      	  <p>First,  proposing small businesses are welcome to partner with a university or research  institute for SBIR, not just STTR. Read the current solicitation for budget  requirements that may help determine which program is more appropriate. </p><p>
      	    For  Phase II STTR, proposing small businesses must have a research partner, similar  to Phase I. However, the research partner does not have to be the same partner  that was a subawardee on the Phase I STTR effort. </p><p>
        If  a Phase I STTR awardee does not wish to work with a research partner for Phase  II, they may submit a Phase II proposal to the NSF SBIR program instead.&nbsp;More information is available here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14103">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14103</a>. </p>
      	<li id="q17"><p class="question">What options are available for  pre-submission feedback, and what should be expected from this feedback?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you still have  questions or need more advice about whether or not to submit, send a 1-2 page  Executive Summary to an NSF SBIR/STTR Program Director. Contact information can  be found here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/contact.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/contact.jsp</a>.  The summary should discuss: the company and team; the market opportunity, value  proposition, and customers; the technology/innovation; and the competition. &nbsp;The  Program Directors will be able to answer questions and provide feedback to help  determine whether or not the project is a good fit. Please only send an  Executive Summary to one Program Director. He/she will forward the Executive  Summary to another colleague if they deem him/her to be more appropriate. </p>
      	<li id="q18"><p class="question">Why should a small business apply to NSF  SBIR/STTR?</p>
  <p>Like applying for  any funding, be it angel, venture, state funding, etc., applying for NSF  SBIR/STTR funding takes time and energy. However, the payoff could be great:</p>
      	  <ul>
      	    <li>A Phase I award can lead to follow-on  investment or other commercial and technical milestones.</li>
      	    <li>A Phase II award provides substantial  support that could spur commercialization even before the end of the grant. For  more capital- and time-intensive technologies, an NSF SBIR/STTR grant could be  the first major (non-dilutive) support that enables a larger chain of  investment to bring the product to market.</li>
      	    <li>Program Directors and program workshops  in Phase I and Phase II provide mentoring and training opportunities.</li>
      	    <li>Proposers who do not receive a Phase  I award can still benefit from the process. A technical plan with  commercialization goals can be a great starting point for other avenues of  support, and feedback from expert reviewers may positively impact the direction  of the technology development, even if it will not be developed under an NSF  Phase I SBIR/STTR grant.</li>
   	      </ul>
      	  <p>Ultimately, as with  every business decision, the decision whether or not to apply for NSF SBIR/STTR  funding can only be made by the small business itself, weighing the risk with  the rewards. </p></li>


      	  <h2>Eligibility</h2>

      	  <li id="q19"><p class="question">Must the proposing legal  entity be formed at the time of the Phase I proposal submission? </p>
   	    <p>The proposing small  business should be a legal entity at the time of proposal submission. A legal  entity is required to complete all of the necessary registrations. </p>
      	  <li id="q20"><p class="question">Does  NSF SBIR/STTR support non-U.S. companies or work that is performed abroad?</p>
  <p>SBIR/STTR  eligibility guidelines state that the majority (more than 50 percent) of a  small business' equity (e.g. stock) must be directly owned and controlled by  one or more individuals who are citizens or permanent residents of the United  States. Additionally, NSF SBIR/STTR only supports work that is performed in the  United States (including work performed by subawardees and consultants).</p>
      	  <li id="q21"><p class="question">Who is the Principal  Investigator (PI) on an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I grant? What are the  responsibilities of the PI? Does the PI need to have a PhD? Can the PI be a  graduate student? </p>
      	    <p>The PI is often the  technical lead on the project. However, another leader on the project may be  named as PI as long as he or she is capable of tracking and communicating  technical progress on the award. The PI is responsible for communicating with  the cognizant Program Director and staff during the course of the award and monitors  the performance of the project to assure adherence to performance goals, time  schedules or other requirements as appropriate to the project or the terms of  the grant. The PI is also responsible for submitting required reports to the  NSF. </p><p>
      	      The PI is NOT  required to have a PhD or any other degree. Graduate students and post-doctoral  researchers are eligible to be the PI on an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposal.  Many NSF SBIR/STTR awards also have PIs with  no graduate training.</p><p>
      	      However, the PI MUST  be <strong>more than 50 percent legally employed </strong>by the proposing small business by the time of the award and for the entire  duration of the Phase I project. NSF normally considers a full time work week  to be 40 hours and considers employment elsewhere of greater than 19.6 hours  per week to be in conflict with this requirement. Additionally, anything that  prevents an individual from meeting this legal employment requirement  (including residency status or university policy) will make that individual  ineligible to be PI. </p><p>
        In addition, the PI must commit a <strong>minimum  level of effort to the project described in the application</strong> (not to be  confused with the greater than 50 percent employment requirement). The minimum  level of effort for the PI to commit to a Phase I SBIR or STTR project is one  month of effort (173 hours).</p>
      	  <li id="q22"><p class="question">May a faculty member at a  college or university serve as the Principal Investigator on an NSF SBIR/STTR  project? </p>
  <p>In most cases,  employment as a faculty member at a college or university conflicts with the  primary employment requirement for the PI of an SBIR/STTR project (see <a href="#q21">Question 21</a>).  &nbsp;However, in some cases, the college or university can grant a leave of  absence or otherwise indicate that the faculty member is permitted to be  employed more than 50 percent of their time employed by the small business for  the duration of the award. </p></li>


      	    <h2>Proposal Preparation and Proposal  Submission via FastLane (NSF&rsquo;s Electronic Submission System)</h2>

      	    <li id="q23"><p class="question">When will  the next SBIR/STTR solicitation be published?
      	    <p>There are no set dates on when  solicitations will be published, but for the last several years, NSF SBIR/STTR  Phase I solicitations have been published twice per year. &nbsp;One  solicitation is published in March, with a June deadline, and another is published  in September, with a December deadline. The minimum amount of time between the  publication of the solicitation and the deadline date will be 90 days.</p>
      	    </li>
      	    <li id="q24"><p class="question">What are the first steps that a first-time  proposer to the NSF SBIR/STTR program should take? </li>
      	    <p>The first step should be to register  the small business AND the PI in FastLane, NSF&rsquo;s electronic submission system. For  help in determining who should be the PI on the project, see <a href="#q20">Question  20</a>.  A DUNS and Employer Identification Number (EIN) are required for FastLane  registration. Registering in FastLane allows you to see the proposal  submission, with the modules that correspond to different parts of the  application. Taking a look early will help you better understand the  information available on the &ldquo;How to Apply&rdquo; page: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/howtoapply.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/howtoapply.jsp</a>. Please note  that NSF SBIR/STTR proposals must be submitted via FastLane and will NOT be  accepted via Research.gov. </p>
      	    <p>Registering a Small Business in the  System for Award Management (SAM) and SBIR Company Registry is also mandatory. See  the &ldquo;Registrations&rdquo; page for more details: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/registration.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/registration.jsp</a>. </p>
      	    <p>In addition, letters of support are  an important part of the proposal and can take time to obtain. We recommend  that proposers collect the letters as early as possible. See <a href="#q43">Question  43</a> for more information. </p>
      	    <li id="q25"><p class="question">What is the <em>NSF Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG)? Some  guidelines in the NSF GPG are not spelled out in the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I  solicitation or conflict with information in the solicitation. Which policy  document should I follow? </p>
      	    <p>The&nbsp;<em>NSF Grant Proposal Guide</em>&nbsp;(GPG) contains NSF&rsquo;s general proposal  preparation and submission guidelines. The SBIR/STTR programs have  solicitations that modify the general provisions of the GPG, and, in such  cases, <strong>the guidelines provided in the  SOLICITATION must be followed</strong>. </p>
   	    <p>The SBIR/STTR Phase  I solicitations include <strong>MANY  instructions that deviate from the GPG</strong>. As such, the solicitations strive  to include, as much as possible, the rules and guidelines that proposers should  know in order to submit a proposal, referencing the GPG when necessary. </p>
      	    <li id="q26"><p class="question">What are the rules or restrictions regarding  contact with NSF SBIR/STTR Program Directors? Must a small business form a  working relationship with a Program Director before submitting a proposal?</p>
  <p>There  is no time during which proposing small businesses are not permitted to contact  the NSF SBIR/STTR Program Directors. However, Program Directors become  increasingly busy as each proposal deadline approaches, so proposers are strongly  encouraged to contact them as early as possible, if they wish to seek guidance.  There is absolutely no requirement to form a working relationship with a  Program Director prior to submission. Additionally, ALL proposals that pass the  initial screening for completeness undergo a rigorous peer review and will be  considered for award.            </p>
      	    <li id="q27"><p class="question">Is  help available for navigating FastLane or troubleshooting proposal submission  problems?</p>
      	      <p>The FastLane  Step-by-Step Guide is a great first resource: https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/fastlane1.jsp  As a reminder, if this guide and the solicitation conflict, <strong>please follow the guidelines in the  solicitation</strong>. <br>
        For questions and  troubleshooting, please call the FastLane Help Desk at 1-800-673-6188  (available 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time). NSF SBIR/STTR staff are well versed  in the contents of the proposal, but the FastLane Help Desk staff are the real  experts for technical issues with FastLane. </p>
      	    <li id="q28"><p class="question">What  if there are changes or updates after a proposal is submitted (but before the  deadline)? Does NSF SBIR/STTR review proposal materials as soon as they are  submitted?</p>
  <p>NSF SBIR/STTR does  not start processing or viewing proposals until after the deadline date. If a  proposal is submitted before the deadline date and needs to be updated (also before  the deadline date), proposers may perform a Proposal  File Update (PFU). Instructions are located here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/proposalfileupdate.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/proposalfileupdate.jsp</a>.</p>
      	    <li id="q29"><p class="question">What  rules must be followed to ensure that a proposal passes the initial  administrative review for completeness and continues on to the peer review  process?</p>
  <p>Please see the &ldquo;DOs  and DON&rsquo;Ts list&rdquo; in the current Phase I solicitation. </p>
      	    <li id="q30"><p class="question">If  the System for Award Management (SAM) indicates that it will take several weeks  for a proposing business&rsquo;s registration to be complete, what should the  business do?</p>
  <p>If the SAM  registration for a company is not active by the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I submission  deadline (or does not match exactly the other company information registered in  FastLane), the proposer will receive a warning when trying to submit a proposal.  The proposer should continue past that warning, as it will NOT stop submission.  The small business should continue to pursue SAM registration, because an  active SAM registration is required to receive an award.</p>
      	    <li id="q31"><p class="question">How  does a proposer know that he or she has successfully submitted an NSF SBIR/STTR  Phase I proposal?</p>
  <p>When a proposal has  been received by NSF, the proposer will receive a seven-digit proposal number that  starts with the last two digits of the current federal government fiscal year.  For example, proposal numbers for proposals submitted from October 1, 2015 to  September 30, 2016 should be seven digits long and begin with &ldquo;16.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>If the final proposal number has  not been given, it is likely that the PI submitted the proposal but has not yet  performed the final step, which is to forward to the small business&rsquo;s Authorized  Organizational Representative (AOR) / Sponsored Research Officer (SRO), who signs  and submits the proposal. Instructions for this step can be found in the  FastLane Step-by-Step Guide: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/fastlane1.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/fastlane1.jsp</a></p>
      	    <li id="q32"><p class="question">How can proposers check on  the status of a Phase I SBIR/STTR proposal after it has been submitted? </p>
  <p>Proposers can log in  as PI (<a href="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/proposals.jsp">www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/proposals.jsp</a>)  and click &ldquo;Proposal Functions,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Proposal Status.&rdquo; Proposals and their  statuses will be listed. Navigating to an individual proposal will enable  proposers to view reviewer comments, when they are available. </p></li>

      	      <h2>Proposal Budget Preparation</h2>
      	      <li id="q33"><p class="question">What is a reasonable salary for the PI and  other personnel on the project?</p>
        <p>It is recommended  that proposers justify proposed salaries using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  Wage Data. More information on using BLS Wage Data can be found here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/documents/SBIR_Salary_Validation_Guide.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/documents/SBIR_Salary_Validation_Guide.pdf</a>.</p>
      	      <li id="q34"><p class="question">Can I have a Co-PI on an NSF SBIR/STTR  proposal?</p>
  <p>NSF SBIR proposals cannot  have Co-PIs. Proposals may include subawardees,  but they should not list a Co-PI.  NSF  STTR proposals; however, must have a subawardee research institution, with a Co-PI  from that institution listed on the cover page and on the sub-budget.</p>
      	      <li id="q35"><p class="question">How should indirect costs be structured for a  Phase I SBIR/STTR project if the proposing small business does not have an  established indirect cost rate?</p>
        <p>Small businesses  without an established indirect cost rate are recommended to make an estimate  based on itemizing and estimating specific indirect costs that it expects to  incur during the Phase I project. Common  types of indirect costs are rent, utilities, some types of insurance, and other  company expenses that are not directly required by the NSF project but are necessary  for the overall operation of the business.  It is recommended that small businesses  without an established indirect cost rate keep their request for indirect costs  and fringe benefits at or below the &ldquo;safe rate&rdquo; (i.e., total indirect costs  plus fringe do not exceed 50 percent of total direct salaries and wages). </p>
      	      <li id="q36"><p class="question">Can a person be listed on the budget as a subawardee and on the main  budget?</p>
                <p>No person can  request funds (or financially benefit) through more than one institution for a  single NSF SBIR/STTR project. Therefore, individuals with a financial interest  in the proposing small business (this includes company equity holders or  employees) cannot request funds through a subaward budget or as a consultant  unless an exception is recommended  by the Program Director and approved by the Division Director for the Division  of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships.  </p>

        <li id="q37"><p class="question">May I budget a subaward to a Federal lab or Federally-Funded  Research and Development Center (FFRDC)?</p>
        <p>Yes, FFRDCs and federal labs are eligible to be  subawardees. A list of FFRDCs is located here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/">https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/</a>. </p>
        <li id="q38"><p class="question">What can be requested on a  subaward budget? </p>
  <p>A subaward budget  (sub-budget) may request funds on the same lines as are permitted for the main  project budget, but with two main exceptions. First, if the subaward is to a  research institution, the sub-budget may contain a request for funds for Postdoctoral  Scholar(s) in Line B.1, Other Personnel (whereas the main budget cannot).  Second, subaward budgets may NOT contain funds on Line K, which is used for a  fee that may only be requested by the proposing small business in the main  budget. </p>
        <li id="q39"><p class="question">May proposers  submit a proposal with more than one subaward (sub-budget?) </p>
  <p>Proposers may request  funds for multiple subawards, as long as the requirements about total budget  allocations are met. For each subaward you request, a full subaward budget must  be prepared, with an accompanying subaward budget justification that explains  and justifies the subaward costs with the same level of detail as the main  project budget. For  STTR, the sum of these subawards must meet the requirement for a minimum of 30  percent of the research, as measured by the budget, to be performed by the  collaborating research institutions.</p>
        <li id="q40"><p class="question">How does NSF define a project participant as a consultant (line G.3 of the  budget)?</p>
  <p>Consultants (also  referred to as &ldquo;contractors&rdquo;) are persons who will work on the project, but who  are not employees of the company.  Consultants typically do not receive a W-2 tax form from the small  business, and are often used to provide a specific service or skill based on  hourly or daily compensation. Consultant services include specialized work that will be performed by  professionals that are not employees of the proposing small business. Purchases  of analytical services, other services, or fabricated components from  commercial sources should not be listed under consultant services and should  instead be reported in the budget under Other Direct Costs/Other (Line G.6). No  person who is an equity holder, employee, or officer of the proposing small  business may be paid as a consultant unless an exception is recommended by the  Program Director and approved by the Division Director for the Division of  Industrial Innovation and Partnerships. All research on an SBIR project,  including that conducted by consultants, must be carried out in the U.S. </p>
        <li id="q41"><p class="question">What are the budget requirements for consultants?</p>
  <p>Each consultant included  in the budget should provide a signed commitment letter, to be included in the  budget justification, stating a) what they will specifically be doing in the  project; b) the number of hours or days that they are committing to the  project; and c) the agreed-upon level of compensation which is not to exceed  the NSF maximum of $600 per day (NSF defines a day as 8 hours). The budget justification must address how the  consultant effort will contribute to the project.&nbsp; The biographical sketch  of each consultant should also be included as part of the &ldquo;biographical  sketches&rdquo; section of the proposal. If  the company wishes to compensate a consultant at a higher rate, it must supply  the additional funding from sources outside the NSF grant (and should  explicitly state this in the budget justification). </p>
        <li id="q42"><p class="question">If other R&amp;D will be performed in  parallel to the NSF SBIR/STTR-funded research, should those efforts be  described in the proposal?</p>
          <p>The NSF SBIR/STTR project focuses on specific  technical goals that must be met in order to ensure the commercial success of  the product or service under development. Therefore, an NSF SBIR/STTR proposal  should primarily address the R&amp;D effort proposed with the NSF funds only. Other  R&amp;D that may be performed with or funded by partners can be mentioned  briefly, but the R&amp;D plan should concentration on only NSF-funded work. </p><p>
            Any resources at the disposal of the small  business or contributed by the small business itself that will not be supported  via the Phase I award may be listed in the Facilities, Equipment, and other  Resources section of the proposal if proposers are concerned about the  appearance of cost sharing.</p></li>

          <h2>Proposal  Review</h2>
          <li id="q43"><p class="question">What criteria are used to evaluate NSF SBIR/STTR proposals?</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals  are reviewed for Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact. For more information on  what this means for SBIR/STTR proposals, please see the following webpage: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/peer_review.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/peer_review.jsp</a>.  The merit review criteria are also listed in the solicitation document. </p>
          <li id="q44"><p class="question">Who evaluates NSF SBIR/STTR  proposals? What does the review process entail? </p>
            <p>In Phase I,  technical reviewers with expertise in the field of research being proposed  and/or the target market area proposed are asked to confidentially review the  proposals. These technical reviewers always possess technical training and  expertise in relevant areas of science, engineering, or technology. The Phase I  review process relies heavily on input from these technical reviewers, with  some reviewers having a mix of commercial and technical expertise. Dedicated  commercial reviewers are sometimes asked to participate on Phase I panels;  however, SBIR/STTR Program Directors also directly help evaluate the  commercialization details of the proposal. </p><p>
              In most cases, similar  proposals are typically placed into groups of 4 to 18 called a &quot;panel.&quot; A group of 3 to 10 reviewers is assigned to a  panel, with each proposal being reviewed by at least three of these  reviewers. The reviewers read their  assigned proposals and provide feedback, and then all of the reviewers meet in  person at NSF or via video conference or conference call to discuss all of the  proposals in the panel. </p><p>
        The Phase II process  is similar, but a greater amount of time and effort is dedicated to the  evaluation and discussion of each proposal. Additionally, each Phase II  proposal generally is assigned to more reviewers. In Phase II, in addition to the technical  reviewers, a minimum of two commercial reviewers review each proposal, paying  particular attention to the commercialization plan.</p>
          <li id="q45"><p class="question">How does NSF manage confidentiality and conflicts of interest during the peer  review process? What can proposers do to ensure that their proprietary information is kept safe?</p>
            <p>NSF  proposals are considered confidential. They are not made public and are not  considered a public disclosure. Proposals are kept within NSF staff and the  external reviewers, who certify that no conflicts of interest are present and  that they will keep the proposal documents and review contents confidential  (see the certification here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/Forms/coiform.docx">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/Forms/coiform.docx</a>). </p><p>
              SBIR/STTR  data are protected from disclosure by the participating agencies for a period  of not less than four years from end of the Phase I or II award.&nbsp; The  protection period is extended with each subsequent related award in order to  avoid harmful disclosure. The SBA has a full set of FAQ items that address data  rights here: <a href="http://www.sbir.gov/faq/data-rights">http://www.sbir.gov/faq/data-rights</a>. </p><p>
        Even  when SBIR/STTR data is no longer under the mandatory protection, NSF still does  not release proposal information publicly.  One exception  occurs in the event of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which is a  rare occurrence. Any sections of the proposal marked as proprietary will not be  made available to the requestor, so it is important to mark sensitive sections  of the proposal as clearly proprietary. If the NSF is able to contact the  SBIR/STTR small business about which information is requested, there is a  second opportunity for the business to redact proprietary information from the  proposal. Because of the nature of this process, proposers are asked NOT to  mark the entire proposal as proprietary. </p>
          <li id="q46"><p class="question">How important are letters of support? What does a strong letter of support  contain?
            </p>
        <p>Letters of support  are extremely important for both Phase I and Phase II proposals. Letters of  support are intended to help convince the reviewers that the proposed  innovation, if developed, would solve a real market need. More generally,  letters of support help validate claims made in the proposal about commercial  impacts. Therefore, letters from potential end users of the technology  (customers) and corporate partners/collaborators are appropriate. Letters from  actual or potential investors can also help. Proposers are recommended to start  early in trying to obtain these letters.</p>
          <li id="q47"><p class="question">Some NSF SBIR/STTR companies build on basic  research that was also funded by the NSF. Are companies that are proposing  projects that are NOT related to NSF or any federal funding at a disadvantage? </p>
  <p>NSF seeks to  understand how basic research, and in particular NSF-funded research, can lead  to technological innovation and potentially commercialization. Therefore, proposers  are encouraged to provide information about the scientific research that has  led to the proposed innovation. For STTR, proposals based on NSF-funded basic  research are strongly encouraged. A solid base in fundamental research lends  credibility to the intellectual merit of the proposal. Ultimately, all  proposals are evaluated according the merit review criteria, and only the best  proposals are funded. NSF &ldquo;lineage&rdquo; alone (or lack of it) should not alter the  fate of a proposal. </p>
          <li id="q48"><p class="question">When does NSF release proposal decisions? What feedback is provided? </p>
  <p>The  schedule and pace of NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I peer review is affected by many  factors. However, several general guidelines are provided below for proposals  that undergo peer review. Proposals that did not pass the administrative  review, and therefore were not sent to the panel review stage (this decision is  called &ldquo;returned without review&rdquo;), may learn of this decision earlier in the  process.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>2-4  months after the deadline date</em> - Proposers,  especially those in consideration for funding, may be contacted by the Program  Director any time after the panel if the panel or Program Director have questions  that must be answered in order for the proposal to be fairly and completely  evaluated. This process of interaction with the Program Director is called  &quot;due diligence.&quot;</li>
              <li><em>4-6  months after the deadline date</em></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Phase I proposals that are chosen for  award will typically receive their official award notice and the award will  begin. </li>
                <li>A proposer whose proposal undergoes  review but is not chosen for an award will be notified of the decision and will  receive anonymous written reviews that can contain helpful information on how  the proposal could be improved. If the reviews are not clear or more  information is desired to be able to resubmit in the next cycle, proposers may  contact the Program Director that managed the review process for a debrief. </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <li id="q49"><p class="question">What if the company&rsquo;s R&amp;D goals or status change during the Phase I review  period?</p>
            <p>Applying to NSF  SBIR/STTR should not change the strategy of a small business or slow down its  progress. If, during the Phase I review process, a small business makes  progress on some of the technical objectives or challenges that are included in  a Phase I proposal that is recommended for award, the program will typically  work with the proposer to update the work plan and objectives for the Phase I  project. It is very rare for a Phase I award to be jeopardized because a  proposing small business has continued to conduct R&amp;D in parallel with the  Phase I review process.</p></li>
            <h2>Phase I Award and Beyond</h2>
            <li id="q50"><p class="question">What are the conditions of an NSF Phase I  SBIR/STTR award?</p>
        <p>NSF SBIR/STTR award  conditions can be found here: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/special_conditions.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/special_conditions.jsp</a> in the section at the bottom of the page. The headings at the top of the award  conditions show topics of interest, like Patent Rights, Payment Schedule, and  Reporting Rights.</p>
            <li id="q51"><p class="question">What if there are changes to the business model or R&amp;D strategy of a small  business during the Phase I NSF SBIR/STTR project?</p>
  <p>NSF SBIR/STTR understands that small businesses,  especially those in the very early stages of development, may undergo business  model changes. This may include choosing a different niche market, a different  product format, etc.&nbsp; During Phase I, NSF SBIR/STTR works with grantees to  adjust (within reason) the Phase I project objectives, work plan, and budget to  reflect changes in the market understanding and business model.&nbsp;However,  changes to a Phase I project that completely shift the focus of the project  away from the initially proposed core innovation are generally not permitted.  Additionally, NSF SBIR/STTR will not support alternative R&amp;D if the work no  longer meets the Phase I program standards for high technical risk.</p>
            <li id="q52"><p class="question">Does NSF SBIR/STTR have a Phase III?</p>
        <p>NSF does not offer Phase  III. Some agencies that run acquisition-based SBIR/STTR programs, such as the  Department of Defense, feature Phase III. In this phase, the agency chooses to  enter into another agreement with the company to continue R&amp;D related to  the project. This project must be supported by non-SBIR/STTR funds. NSF does  not acquire technologies that are developed under the SBIR/STTR program and  therefore does not offer a Phase III program.</p>
            <li id="q53"><p class="question">For SBIR and STTR, how much of the NSF-funded research and development must be  performed by the awardee? (In Phase I and Phase II of each program)</p><p>
                For SBIR Phase I, a minimum of <strong>two-thirds</strong> <strong>(66  percent) </strong>of the R&amp;D, as measured by the budget, must be performed by  the awardee. For SBIR Phase II, a minimum of <strong>one-half (50 percent)</strong> of  the R&amp;D must be performed by the awardee.</p><p>
        For STTR, in both Phase I and Phase II a <strong>minimum of 40 percent</strong> of the budget  must go to the small business and minimum of <strong>30 percent</strong> to the research partner.</p>
            <li id="q54"><p class="question">How does the NSF weigh the two major SBIR/STTR review criteria, Intellectual  Merit and Broader/Commercial Impacts, during the review process?</p><p>
                Intellectual Merit and Broader/Commercial Impacts  are equally important for the purposes of making award recommendations.</p>
