        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program supports research on the ecological, evolutionary, and socio-ecological principles and processes that influence the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The central theme of submitted projects must be quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics. The intent is discovery of principles of infectious disease transmission and testing mathematical or computational models that elucidate infectious disease systems. Projects should be broad, interdisciplinary efforts that go beyond the scope of typical studies. They should focus on the determinants and interactions of transmission among humans, non-human animals, and/or plants. This includes, for example, the spread of pathogens; the influence of environmental factors such as climate; the population dynamics and genetics of reservoir species or hosts; the cultural, social, behavioral, and economic dimensions of disease transmission. Research may be on zoonotic, environmentally-borne, vector-borne, or enteric diseases of either terrestrial or freshwater systems and organisms, including diseases of animals and plants, at any scale from specific pathogens to inclusive environmental systems. Proposals for research on disease systems of public health concern to developing countries are strongly encouraged, as are disease systems of concern in agricultural systems. Investigators are encouraged to develop the appropriate multidisciplinary team, including for example, modelers, bioinformaticians, genomics researchers, social scientists, economists, epidemiologists, entomologists, parasitologists, microbiologists, bacteriologists, virologists, pathologists or veterinarians, with the goal of integrating knowledge across disciplines to enhance our ability to predict and control infectious diseases.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The past twenty years have seen a dramatic increase in our awareness of the need to understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of disease emergence and transmission dynamics. While our knowledge has increased about specific systems and the basic principles of simple systems, understanding of complex systems and translation of those principles into ecosystem, public health, and agricultural health management tools remains challenging. System complexity includes such factors as multiple interacting species of hosts, pathogens and/or vectors; interactions among pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes; interactions between biological, cultural and social factors; effects of spatial and temporal structure; and evolutionary dynamics.</p>
          <p>The emergence and the re-emergence of numerous infectious diseases around the world have coincided with unprecedented rates of change in the structure and diversity of the environment and human social and economic systems. Nearly all of the world's terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have undergone dramatic changes due to a variety of human activities such as habitat transformation, human displacement and relocation, urbanization, rapid long-distance transport and increased international trade, species invasions, deliberate introduction of infectious diseases for biological control, wildlife trafficking, chemical waste contamination, use of antimicrobial agents in agriculture and medicine, and climate change. The coincidence of broad scale environmental changes, the expansion of human social and economic networks, and the emergence of infectious diseases may point to underlying predictable ecological relationships.</p>
          <p>We have improved our ability to define the molecular identity and dynamics of pathogens, and have greatly increased our understanding of host defense systems. We are able to apply genetic knowledge to understand the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases. These improvements have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the epidemiology and transmission patterns of diseases. However, the relationship of these factors to the biotic and structural complexity of ecological, agricultural, and socio-ecological systems in which transmission occurs remains poorly understood. For example, little is known about the transmission dynamics of interacting pathogens and non-pathogens within a common host. In addition, although these dynamics take place over evolutionary time for pathogens and in the context of social systems, insufficient attention has been given to integrating ecological, epidemiological, evolutionary, and socio-economic dynamics.</p>
          <p>At present, basic and applied research in infectious disease ecology and evolution are not well integrated. The potential benefits of an interdisciplinary research program in this area include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>development of disease transmission theory,</li>
            <li>improved understanding of how diseases (re)emerge,</li>
            <li>improved understanding of host population and ecosystem effects on disease transmission,</li>
            <li>increased capacity to forecast outbreaks,</li>
            <li>improved understanding of unintended health effects of development projects affecting terrestrial and freshwater systems,</li>
            <li>enhanced safety of food supplies, and</li>
            <li>improved strategies to control or prevent infectious diseases and enhance biosecurity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An understudied aspect of disease transmission is the importance of socio-ecological factors and processes. Important new insights into the drivers and control of infectious diseases in humans and other species can only be achieved by integrated approaches that take into account the ways in which the natural and social environments affect the emergence and spread of infectious disease. This concept, often called "one health," links medical, veterinary, social and environmental sciences by drawing on a common pool of knowledge between the three sectors in order to exploit the potential of animal disease research to provide insights into ecosystem, agricultural, and human health.</p>
          <p>This activity is a continuation of the previous joint National Science Foundation/National Institutes of Health/United States Department of Agriculture (NSF/NIH/USDA) Ecology of Infectious Disease competition.

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The goal of the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) program is to support important and innovative research on the ecological, evolutionary, and socio-ecological principles that influence the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The program's focus is on the discovery of general principles and processes and on building and testing models that elucidate these principles. <strong>P</strong><strong>rojects must address quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics.</strong> Research in EEID is expected to be an interdisciplinary effort that goes beyond the scope of typical studies funded by the standing programs of the partner agencies. They should bring together such areas as anthropology, bioinformatics, computational science, ecology, economics, epidemiology, evolution, food science, genomics, geography, global health, mathematics, medicine, microbiology, plant science, population biology, sociology, physical environmental sciences, systems science, and veterinary medicine. Research within EEID is expected to generate rigorously characterized and tested models that are of value to the scientific community, but also may be useful in decision making. <strong>The history of the EEID program has shown that the most competitive proposals are those that advance broad, conceptual knowledge that reaches beyond the specific system under study and that may be useful for understanding public, agricultural or ecosystem health, natural resource use and wildlife management, and/or economic development. Such proposals are typically interdisciplinary in their approach and/or the nature of the question(s) being addressed.</strong></p>
          <p>Infectious disease transmission reflects complex, dynamic relationships that occur on varying spatial and temporal landscapes, are created by both ecological and evolutionary processes, and are revealed in genome architecture, physiological systems, population dynamics, and community structure, as well as behavioral and social dynamics. The interactions between disease-causing organisms, their vectors, and their host(s) are embedded within much larger networks of interacting systems, including other microorganisms that may or may not cause disease, one or more vector species, and multiple host species. Analysis of environmental influences (biological, geophysical, economic, and social) on individual and population susceptibility is fundamental to understanding these complex systems of infectious diseases. Research into the ecology (population, community, evolutionary, and social) of infectious diseases will contribute to a deeper understanding of these complex infectious disease systems, to the development of well characterized and tested models, and to the elucidation of general ecological and evolutionary principles.</p>
          <p>Insights into the dynamics of infectious disease systems may require integration across several temporal, spatial, and functional scales including molecular, individual, population, societal, and ecosystem levels. Similarly, they may require integration across biological, socio-economic, and geophysical domains. The field of evolutionary ecology, which focuses on both the importance of ecological context in studies of evolution and the importance of evolutionary change for ecological systems, may also provide important insights into infectious disease systems. The interplay of evolution and ecology has implications for<a title="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> understanding how infectious agents emerge as pathogens, adapt to one or more hosts, interact with other microbial communities (e.g., microbiome), and are transmitted among hosts.</p>
          <p>A critical goal of research supported by this program is the generation of principles and conceptual frameworks that organize and inform the research and that lead to mathematical, computational, and statistical models of infectious disease dynamics. Diverse modeling approaches are appropriate, including, but not limited to, mathematical equations, computational simulations, geospatial algorithms, and statistical models. <strong>For the EEID program, the most competitive proposals are organized around an overarching conceptual framework that leads to such a model.</strong> Models should aim to be explanatory beyond the specific system under study and must be well-characterized and rigorously tested. Proposals must describe how models will be developed, evaluated, and disseminated. Proposals must identify which individual(s) will oversee the quantitative approaches and provide evidence of demonstrated expertise in mathematical, computational, or statistical modeling and/or data analysis. Likewise, strategies for data collection must be well designed to contribute to and test model design. Proposals must include plans for dissemination of data, models, and tools developed by this program.</p>
          <p>A variety of <em>topics, questions, systems and approaches</em> are appropriate. Among the areas of particular interest are: the role of social influences on the susceptibility of individuals or populations; multiway interactions between pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms and their mutual hosts; the role of medical, agricultural or environmental practices on pathogen emergence and transmission; emergence of pathogens from non-pathogenic populations; host switching; evolutionary dynamics in an ecological context such as disease control interventions and drug resistance. These topics have significant ecological and evolutionary components that should be studied as a system, not in isolation. Depending on the hypotheses or research questions being addressed, investigations might entail some combination of laboratory experiments, field observations or manipulations, public health interventions (although clinical trials are beyond the scope of the EEID program), analysis of social and cultural processes, or ethnographic studies. Research may also focus on novel analyses of existing data and/or theoretical investigations of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Investigations may focus on model infectious disease systems in natural (terrestrial or freshwater) or laboratory settings where those systems elucidate general principles.</p>
          <p>Research may use a variety of study systems. The organism(s) or system(s) selected for study should be justified with respect to its suitability to study questions of ecology and/or evolutionary ecology. Research may involve a variety of infectious agents, individual diseases, or groups of diseases, and might involve one or more social systems, regions, habitats, or groups of organisms. Proposals may focus on terrestrial or freshwater systems and organisms and may include infectious diseases of humans, non-human animals, or plants. Proposals for research on diseases of public or agricultural health concern to developing countries, including potential pandemic diseases, are encouraged. <strong>Regardless of the system or approach taken, a proposal must have a significant focus on the ecology of disease transmission to be eligible for funding.</strong></p>
          <p>Because of the complexity of studies on the ecology and evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases, multidisciplinary teams of domestic and international collaborators with expertise from diverse disciplines are likely to be most effective. Investigators are encouraged to develop collaborations with public health research communities where that is appropriate. Collaborative teams could include, for example: ecologists, epidemiologists, medical scientists, veterinary scientists, social and behavioral scientists, entomologists, food scientists, microbiologists, pathologists, and parasitologists, geologists, hydrologists, geospatial analysts, and mathematicians. The research plan should indicate how multiple disciplines will be integrated and how new investigators in U.S. and collaborating foreign institutions will be prepared to further this research.</p>
          <p><strong>The EEID program is not intended to be the only avenue of support by the participating agencies for supporting research on infectious diseases. Specifically, proposals submitted in response to this announcement must address ecological dynamics and among-host transmission, even when evolutionary studies are a substantive part of the proposal. Investigations that are outside the scope of this EEID announcement include:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>those limited solely to genetic patterns of evolutionary change (e.g., comparative genomics),</li>
            <li>those that focus solely on human diseases without considering the broader ecological context,</li>
            <li>those that focus solely on within-host biological processes,</li>
            <li>those that focus solely on vector species ecology, and</li>
            <li>those that have not pre-identified at least one pathogenic organism that will be the focus of the study (i.e., metagenomic surveys to identify the pathogenic organism are not included in this solicitation). </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Projects focusing on <strong>marine systems are no longer accepted</strong>, except for those dealing with aquacultural systems within the purview of the USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Projects focused on disease ecology in marine systems, <em>might</em> be appropriate for the <a title="Biological Oceanography" href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?%20http:/www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11696&amp;org=OCE&amp;from=home" target="_blank">Biological Oceanography</a> program in the Division of Ocean Sciences. However, projects that primarily investigate the fundamental microbiology, physiology, or molecular biology (i.e., not ecology) of specific marine syndromes/diseases are not appropriate for the Biological Oceanography program. You may contact program officers in the Biological Oceanography program to clarify the suitability of your project before submission.</p>
          <p>The EEID competition broadly welcomes projects that include international collaborators. Two specific forms of collaboration (US-UK Collaborative Projects and US-Israel Collaborative Projects) are described below. These specific activities do not preclude other international collaborations. Nor do they require that a proposal have an international collaborator.</p>

          <p>Approximately 9 new awards are anticipated in FY 2017, depending on the quality of submissions and the availability of funds; the expected funding will be $13.5 million. That amount includes approximately $5M from the NSF for new standard or continuing awards, approximately $5M from the NIH for new or continuing awards, and $3.5M from the USDA for new awards. Of those awards, 2-4 are anticipated to be US-UK Collaborative Projects, depending on the quality of submissions and the availability of funds; the expected funding from the BBSRC for this call is up to &pound;2M. This amount reflects 80% of the full economic costs in the U.K. Of those awards, up to 1 is anticipated to be a US-Israel Collaborative Project, depending on the quality of submissions and the availability of funds; the expected funding from the BSF for the Israeli component of the US-Israel Collaborative Projects will be a maximum of $80,000/year.</p>
          <p>Upon conclusion of the review process, meritorious proposals may be recommended for funding by either NSF, NIH, or USDA, at the option of the agencies, not the proposing organizations. Proposals selected for funding by NIH or USDA will need to be reformatted and resubmitted to that agency. Subsequent submission and grant administration procedures will be in accordance with the individual policies of the awarding agency.</p>
          <p>Proposals selected for funding consideration by the NIH will be invited to resubmit to the Division of Receipt and Referral (DRR) in NIH's Center for Scientific Review (CSR) (see Section VI.B).  PIs submitting to the NIH must be registered in eRA Commons and the applicant's organization must be registered with SAM, Grants.gov and eRA Commons.  PIs should therefore ensure that all registrations required for NIH submission are in place before the NIH receipt deadline.</p>
          <p>USDA/NIFA Legislative Authority: The USDA authority for this RFA is contained in Section 7406 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (FCEA) (Pub.

        <p><strong>Special Information and Supplementary Documentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proposals Involving Multiple Institutions</strong>
            <p>In the case of proposals involving multiple organizations, a single organization must be identified as the lead, and a single proposal describing the entire project must be submitted by that organization. Funds may be distributed among partner organizations via subawards from the lead organization. A budget on the standard NSF budget form should be submitted for each subawardee. The requirement for a single organization to submit the sole proposal for a project is designed to facilitate effective coordination among participating organizations and to avoid difficulties that ensue in funded projects when individuals change organizations and/or cease to fulfill project responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Of the two types of collaborative proposal formats described in the <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em>, this solicitation allows only a single proposal submission with subawards administered by that lead organization.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Research Experiences for Undergraduates.</strong> Projects anticipating the inclusion of undergraduate research experiences may include those as part of the research proposal itself, rather than as a subsequent supplemental request. See the REU soliciation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=5517&amp;ods_key=nsf13542">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=5517&amp;ods_key=nsf13542</a>) for additional information.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A list of Senior Personnel. </strong>In lieu of the instructions specified in the GPG, Collaborators and Other Affiliations Information should be submitted as follows: All projects must provide a single, consolidated list of senior personnel as a <strong>Single Copy Document</strong>. This list is used to facilitate the identification of potential conflicts of interest in review. The list must include all PIs, co-PIs, and other Senior Personnel on the proposed project, including collaborators, and optionally may include Other Personnel from the Postdoctoral and Other Professional categories. The <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> Exhibit II-7 provides the definition of personnel categories: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf16001/gpg_2.jsp#IIex7" target="_blank">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf16001/gpg_2.jsp#IIex7</a>.
            <p><strong>Each individual must be listed on a separate line using the following format:</strong></p>
            <p>Person Name (last name, first name), Institution Name, Role in project</p>
            <p>as in these examples:</p>
            <p>Doe, Jane, State University of Science and Technology, PI</p>
            <p>Smith, John, Memorial Research Institute, collaborator</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Role in project&rdquo; must be from the following list: PI, co-PI, Senior Personnel, collaborator, post-doctoral scholar.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Letters of Collaboration.</strong> Supplementary Documents may include letters of collaboration from individuals or organizations that are integral parts of the proposed project but are not listed as PI, co-PI, or other senior personnel on the main proposal or any subaward. Such involvement may include subsidiary involvement in some aspect of the project, cooperation on outreach efforts, or documentation of permission to access materials or data. Letters of collaboration should focus solely on affirming that the individual or organization is willing to collaborate on the project as specified in the project description. No additional text, especially elaboration of the nature of activities to be undertaken by the collaborator and endorsements of the potential value or significance of the project for the collaborator, may be included. The template that <strong>must</strong> be used for the preparation of letters of collaboration is provided below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Letters of collaboration should not be provided from any individual designated as a principal investigator or senior personnel, nor are letters of collaboration required from any organization that will be a subawardee in the proposal budget. </p>
        <p>Each letter of collaboration <strong>must</strong> be signed by the designated collaborator. Requests to collaborators for letters of collaboration should be made by the PI well in advance of the proposal submission deadline, because they <strong>must</strong> be included at the time of the proposal submission. <strong>Letters deviating from this template will not be accepted and may be grounds for returning the proposal without review.</strong></p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
      
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
     <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><em><strong>Significance</strong></em>. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?</li>
          <li><em><strong>Investigator(s)</strong></em>. Are the PD/PIs, collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If early career investigators, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?</li>
          <li><em><strong>Innovation</strong></em>. Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?</li>
          <li><em><strong>Approach</strong></em>. Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? <br />
            If the project involves clinical research, are the plans for 1) protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?</li>
          <li><em><strong>Environment</strong></em>. Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?</li>
          <li><strong><em>Biohazards.</em></strong> Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where relevant, proposals will also be reviewed with respect to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong><em>Protections for Human Subjects. </em></strong>For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the reviewers will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. However, most clinical trials are beyond the scope of the EEID program.</p>
            <p>For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the reviewers will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children.</em></strong> When the proposed project involves clinical research, the reviewers will evaluate the proposed plans for inclusion of minorities and members of both genders, as well as the inclusion of children.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Vertebrate Animals.</em></strong> The reviewers will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For all proposals involving international collaborations, reviewers will consider: mutual benefits, true intellectual collaboration with the foreign partner(s), benefits to be realized from the expertise and specialized skills, facilities, sites and/or resources of the international counterpart, and active research engagement of U.S. students and early-career researchers, where such individuals are engaged in the research.</p>
        <p>US-UK and US- Israel Collaborative Projects will also be reviewed with respect to the extent which they demonstrate a substantial collaboration between the US and foreign partners and enhance research on infectious disease transmission. The review will take into account the foreign research context.</p>


        <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>NSF will manage the review of proposals in consultation with NIH and USDA, and in the case of US-UK and US- Israel Collaborative Projects, the BBSRC and BSF. Copies of proposals and unattributed reviews will be shared with the partner funding organizations, as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p> Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

        <p><strong>NSF Process: </strong>Those proposals selected for funding by NSF will be handled in accordance with standard NSF procedures. After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p><strong>NIH Process:</strong> Proposals selected for funding consideration by NIH will be invited to submit reformatted applications to the Division of Receipt and Referral (DRR) in NIH's Center for Scientific Review (CSR). A receipt date of approximately March 15 annually is in effect for the NIH formatted applications. Following initial NSF-led peer review, recommended applications that have been resubmitted to the NIH will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scientific and technical merit of the proposed project as determined by scientific peer review.</li>
          <li>Availability of funds.</li>
          <li>Relevance of the proposed project to program priorities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subsequent award processing and grant administration procedures will be in accordance with NIH policies and procedures.</p>
        <p><strong>USDA/NIFA Process:</strong> Applicants submitting proposals selected for funding by USDA/NIFA will receive specific instructions outlining what additional information is needed in accordance with the policies of the agency. USDA/NIFA will make final funding decisions based on the results of the peer review process. Applications selected for funding by NIFA will be forwarded to the USDA/NIFA Awards Management Division for award processing in accordance with the USDA/NIFA procedures. All proposals selected for funding by USDA/NIFA, in FY 2017 will be limited to 30 percent indirect cost rate. Therefore, the recovery of indirect costs on awards made by NIFA under this program area may not exceed the lesser of the institution's official negotiated indirect cost rate or the equivalent of 30 percent of total Federal funds awarded. If the limitation of indirect costs changes, the applicant will be notified.</p>
        <p><strong>US-UK Collaborative Projects:</strong> The UK component of the collaboration will be awarded through the BBSRC in accordance with the policies of that agency. If the BBSRC selects an application for funding, the costs for the UK element of the proposal must be submitted via the RCUK's Je-S application submission system before final sign-off. UK collaborators should therefore ensure they are registered Je-S users before the proposal is submitted.</p>
        <p><strong>US-Israel Collaborative Projects: </strong> The Israeli component of the collaboration will be awarded through the BSF in accordance with its policies and regulations. The collaborative proposal must be submitted to the BSF by both the Israeli and US scientists at the time it is submitted to the NSF.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov may be obtained at <a href="http://www.grants.gov">http://www.grants.gov</a>.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
