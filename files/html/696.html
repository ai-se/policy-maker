<li><a href="#cypuw">Can you provide us with additional guidance on the education and diversity efforts? </a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#manf">May a not-for-profit  501(c)(3) submit a proposal to this program that contains at least one or two  U.S. academic institutions with significant research and degree-granting  education programs as well as national laboratories and state and local  government laboratories?</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Number of preliminary proposals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#pcts">Please clarify the statement within your Science  and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships  Program Solicitation that states: </a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost sharing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#cypc">Could you please clarify the language regarding  the cost sharing requirements?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budgets for Preliminary Proposal and Full Proposal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tsra">The solicitation requests a budget for the  five-year period only. Should we submit a budget for each year in the  preliminary proposal?</a></li>
<li><a href="#swsa">Should we submit a budget for each subawardee or  participating institution in the preliminary proposal or the full proposal?</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Lists of Institutions and Project Personnel&mdash;page limit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#iest">In earlier solicitations, there were page limits  set for the lists of project personnel and institutions. Are there page limits  for this new solicitation?</a></li>

<p><strong>Federal Government laboratory partnerships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#iaii">I am interested in preparing a preliminary  proposal for the new STC Program Solicitation. The Program Solicitation  mentions collaborations and partnerships with National Laboratories. Can you  tell me what limitations apply to these collaborations regarding funding  resources? In particular, is it possible to provide money directly to lab  personnel for salary, travel, and hiring of students and post-docs?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>International collaboration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#hdnv">How does NSF view international collaboration?</a></li>
<li><a href="#awad">As we are developing our preliminary proposal  for an STC, we had a question concerning international participation. We would  like to know if it is acceptable to include international industries as well as  academics in the STCs.</a></li>
<li><a href="#cafi">Can a foreign institution, as a partner or  subcontractor, be financed with funds from an STC award?</a></li>
<li><a href="#gswo">Graduate students working on our proposed STC  will be supported as research assistants. I assume that these positions would  be open to any qualified student, foreign or U.S. that we admit to our graduate  programs, as is the case with an NSF grant. If there are restrictions on  appointing research assistants we would like to be made aware of them.</a></li>
<li><a href="#opcd">Our proposed Center does not  include a &quot;fellowship program&quot; as such. However, we would like to  propose paying for &quot;three-month living stipends&quot; for students from  collaborating institutions in foreign countries to visit members of the Center  for cooperative research and training. If there are any restrictions on this,  please advise.</a></li>
<li><a href="#iiaf">Is it acceptable for a foreign laboratory to  allocate and pay for a foreign post-graduate fellowship for our proposed STC?</a></li>

<strong><a name="hdtn" id="hdtn"></a></strong><strong> How does the new FY 2008 STC Program Solicitation differ  from the previous FY 2003 STC Program Solicitation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf03550">NSF 03-550</a>)?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> The new STC Program Solicitation has been revised in  several ways, including the elimination of cost sharing, a reduction in the  number of preliminary proposals per lead institution, and an increase in the annual  NSF award budget. Highlights of the changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost sharing no longer required for preliminary or       full proposals;</li>
<li>Maximum annual NSF budget increased to $5,000,000;</li>
<li>New requirements regarding allowed fonts and font       sizes as specified in the revised NSF Grant Proposal Guide <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a>;</li>
<li>New due date for preliminary proposals: September 30,       2008;</li>
<li>Deadline for full proposals (by invitation only): April       30, 2009;</li>
<li>Expected start date for awarded STCs: June 2010;</li>
<li>Limits the number of preliminary proposals allowed by       a lead institution to three;</li>
<li>Current and pending support statements required for       PI and co-PIs;</li>
<li>Centers with <em>funded</em> partner institutions must use subaward rather than collaborative proposal       mechanism;</li>
<li>Strengthened language for preliminary and full       proposal content:
<ul>
<li>Transformative Research</li>
<li>Cyberinfrastructure</li>
<li>Global context</li>
<li>Assessment</li>
<li>Broadening participation</li>
<li>U.S.        student participation.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="wrts" id="wrts"></a> What remains the same in the new STC Solicitation?<br />
<br />
</strong> The objectives of the STC Program remain the same as in the  previous solicitation. Most of the changes to this new solicitation are  intended to clarify NSF's intent, and to streamline and improve the review  process, based on experience with the previous competitions. Several main  features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pending availability of funds, $25 million to be       available to make between 5-7 awards;</li>
<li>Requires submission of comprehensive lists of       personnel, institutions, and collaborators involved for determining       conflicts of interest;</li>
<li>Provides deadline dates for preliminary proposals and       full proposals;</li>
<li>Preliminary proposals to be submitted via FastLane;</li>
<li>Full proposals to be submitted via FastLane or       Grants.gov;</li>
<li>Full proposals by invitation only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="greysubhd">2. Research areas appropriate for STCs</strong><br />
<img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="line" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="wraa" id="wraa"></a> What research areas are appropriate for STC preliminary  proposals and full proposals?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> NSF will entertain STC preliminary proposals and full  proposals in all areas of research and education normally supported by the  Foundation.
<p><strong><a name="wraac" id="wraac"></a> What research areas are covered by the existing STCs?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> This information and more about the existing STCs can be  found at the following URL: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><strong class="greysubhd">3. Education Plan </strong><br />
<img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="line" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="hiso" id="hiso"></a> How involved should our Center be in education?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> NSF expects each Center to make the education of students who  are U.S.  citizens, nationals and permanent residents a high priority and to apply the  same scholarly mind-set to education as to research. A Center is expected to  understand the challenges facing education in its areas of research, and the  contributions that the Center has the potential to make to address those  challenges. The contributions desired by the Center then drive the design of  specific educational activities and their evaluation.
<p><strong><a name="mech" id="mech"></a> Must each Center have K-12 activities? The past  solicitation made mention of K-12, but we don&rsquo;t see it in this solicitation.</strong>
<p><strong></strong> No, there is no requirement for K-12 activities. Each  Center should undertake activities at the level of education that serves the  Center research and education goals. 
<p><strong><a name="hmds" id="hmds"></a>How much detail should be provided if the  educational focus is on undergraduate students, K-12 or other outreach activities?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> In  all cases, proposals should contain enough detail such that reviewers can  evaluate the importance of the effort and the likelihood of success.&nbsp; For example, proposals that include a focus  on undergraduate education activities should reflect current understanding of  how students learn in STEM fields and engaging pedagogy. For those proposing  K-12 activities, briefly describe how this effort builds upon existing robust  K-12 activities with K-12 organizations or plans to form collaborations with  large scale projects such as NSF Math and Science Partnership projects. In  addition, briefly outline plans (if any) for public engagement and outreach  through partnerships with organizations experienced in informal learning and  serving public audiences.&nbsp;
<p><strong><a name="cypuw" id="cypuw"></a>Can you provide us with additional guidance on the education and diversity efforts?
</strong>
<p>Here are some points to consider as you prepare your plans  for your education and diversity efforts:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Clearly       define the goals of the Center&rsquo;s education and diversity efforts and       translate these into outcomes you would expect to see if you achieved       these goals. Think of the goals as your intentions or ambitions and the       expected outcomes as the observation you would see if you achieved your       ambitions or intentions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Describe       the evaluation plan that the Center will use in monitoring progress toward       the expected education and diversity outcomes.&nbsp; This plan should identify the       evaluators, provide some details on the protocols and indicate how the       education and diversity plans will be adapted and how the results will be       shared through the literature on successful practices.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Focus       the Center&rsquo;s education and diversity efforts on a few activities that are       substantial with high potential impact.&nbsp;       A concentrated in-depth effort is more likely to have an impact       than a large number of superficial unrelated efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>If       possible, build the Center&rsquo;s education and diversity efforts on existing,       successful efforts.&nbsp; The Center&rsquo;s       involvement should significantly expand these efforts and the value added       by the Center&rsquo;s involvement should be clear.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>For       education and diversity activities that represent new initiatives,       indicate all collaborations or connections that will enable these       activities and provide a basis for estimating the likelihood of success.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Describe       the research or existing practices that provides the rationale for the       planned education and diversity activities.&nbsp; This discussion should demonstrate an       understanding of the issues involved in these activities and support the       choices the Center has made.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Show       how the planned education and diversity activities are related to the       Center&rsquo;s research and technology development emphases. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Indicate       who will participate in each education and diversity activity and ensure       that all participating institutions are involved substantially in some of       these activities and that none of the activities are relegated to a single       institution.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Describe       how the Center&rsquo;s activities will broaden participation of underrepresented       groups, e.g., underrepresented racial or ethnic minorities, women, and       people with disabilities, at all participating institutions.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="greysubhd">4. Eligibility</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="manf" id="manf"></a> May a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) submit a proposal to this  program that contains at least one or two U.S. academic institutions with  significant research and degree-granting education programs as well as national  laboratories and state and local government laboratories?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> No. The lead institution submitting an STC preliminary or  full proposal must be a U.S.  academic institution with research and degree-granting education programs in  any area of science and engineering normally supported by NSF. A not-for-profit  501(c)(3) can be a partner with the lead institution that submits the STC  preliminary or full proposal, but cannot be the lead institution itself.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">5. Number of preliminary proposals</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="pcts" id="pcts"></a> Please clarify the statement within your Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships  Program Solicitation that states: </strong>
<p>&quot;A single organization may submit a maximum of three  preliminary proposals as the lead institution.&nbsp;  A single organization may also request funding via a subaward as a <em>funded</em> partner organization.&nbsp; In no case may an organization request funds as  a lead or funded partner organization on more than five preliminary proposals. Note  that this limit only applies if an organization is requesting NSF support,  i.e., there is no limit on the number of proposals in which an organization may  participate as an <em>unfunded</em> partner.&quot;<strong></strong> Your institution may submit a maximum of three preliminary  proposals as lead.&nbsp; In addition, your  institution may be listed as a subawardee in proposals submitted by other  institutions.&nbsp; The sum of the number of  proposals that your institution submits as lead plus the number of proposals in  which your institution appears as a subawardee may not exceed five.&nbsp; Your institution may participate as an <strong>unfunded</strong> partner on an unlimited number  of preliminary proposals that are submitted by lead institutions other than  your own.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">6. Cost sharing</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="cypc" id="cypc"></a> Could you please clarify the language regarding the cost  sharing requirements?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> Cost sharing is no longer required.&nbsp; Voluntary cost sharing, if provided, will <strong>NOT</strong> influence the funding  recommendation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="greysubhd">7. Budgets for Preliminary Proposal and Full Proposal</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="tsra" id="tsra"></a> The solicitation requests a budget for the five-year  period only. Should we submit a budget for each year in the preliminary  proposal?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> No. You should only provide a total budget for the full  five-year period. In FastLane, enter the total 5-year budget in &quot;Budget  year 1&quot;. A detailed budget for each year and budgets for  subawardees/subcontractors should not be submitted in the preliminary proposal.  However, you should briefly describe in your budget justification how funds  will be allocated for each year to the research, education, and knowledge  transfer areas, for each participant, and indicate your plans for the start-up  phase of the Center. You should also indicate large, costly items, such as  major equipment, that will be needed.
<p><strong><a name="swsa" id="swsa"></a> Should we submit a budget for each subawardee or  participating institution in the preliminary proposal or the full proposal?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> Not in the preliminary proposal. NSF needs only the total  budget for the preliminary proposal. For the full proposal, a budget for each  subwardee is needed. The lead institution budget should show total amounts; the  sum of all the subawardee budgets should add up to the amount shown on the lead  institution budget page for subawardees.
<p><strong><a name="watw" id="watw"></a>&nbsp; We anticipate that  we will need air or ship time.&nbsp; Should  these costs be included in our STC budget request?</strong>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp; Yes
<p><strong class="greysubhd">8. STC Directors&mdash;citizenship and eligibility</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="apre" id="apre"></a> Are permanent residents eligible to be prospective STC  directors?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> Yes
<p><strong class="greysubhd">9. Notice of intent</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="dnrl" id="dnrl"></a> Does NSF require letters of intent for this competition  as it did in earlier competitions?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> No. Letters of intent are not required, and should not be  submitted.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">10. Lists of Institutions and Project Personnel&mdash;page limit</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="iest" id="iest"></a> In earlier solicitations, there were page limits set for  the lists of project personnel and institutions. Are there page limits for this  new solicitation?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> No. In short, accuracy is much more important to us than  the page limit&mdash;both for the list of participants and list of collaborators/conflicts.  Please use as many pages as needed for full and accurate lists. However, the  lists should include no material other than that asked for in the Program  Solicitation. The font size should be the same throughout the proposal. Please  be advised that page limits as indicated for other sections of the proposal  will be strictly enforced.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">11. Lists of Institutions, Project Personnel, and  Collaborators&mdash;Conflicts of Interest</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="tsps" id="tsps"></a> The STC Program Solicitation asks for lists of  institutions, project personnel, and collaborators with Conflicts of Interest.  What constitutes a Conflict of Interest?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> In addition to lists of institutions and project personnel,  the STC Program Solicitation requires that Principal Investigators provide, to  the best of their ability, a list of all collaborators, participants and  affiliates, to aid NSF in identifying reviewers who may have potential  conflicts of interest with any of the project's personnel (PI, co-PI, and other  personnel).
<p>To assist you in knowing  what constitutes a Conflict of Interest, be advised that when your preliminary  proposal or full proposal is reviewed by the National Science Foundation,  reviewers will be asked to disclose as potential conflicts of interest any of  their affiliations and relationships in the areas listed below.
<p>We realize that a PI cannot  be expected to know all the details of conflicts of interest for the entire  potential reviewing community. Therefore, for purposes of the STC collaborators  list, please concentrate your efforts on providing us with information for  those collaborators whose Conflicts of Interest can be found under the first  major grouping below, namely, &quot;Personal Relationship with an Investigator,  Project Director, or Other Person Who Has a Personal Interest in the Proposal  or Other Application.&quot;
<ul>
<li><strong>PERSONAL       RELATIONSHIP WITH AN INVESTIGATOR, PROJECT DIRECTOR, OR OTHER PERSON WHO       HAS A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE PROPOSAL OR OTHER APPLICATION</strong>
<ul>
<li>Known family relationship as spouse, child,        sibling, or parent.</li>
<li>Business or professional partnership.</li>
<li>Past or present association as thesis advisor or        thesis student.</li>
<li>Collaboration on a project or on a book, article,        report, or paper within the last 48 months.</li>
<li>Co-editing or a journal, compendium, or conference        proceeding within the last 24 months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PERSONAL       AFFILIATIONS WITH THE APPLICANT AND PARTNER INSTITUTIONS </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A person  may have a conflict if they have/hold/are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span dir="ltr">Current employment at the  institution as a professor, adjunct professor, visiting professor, or similar  position. (NOTE: Please do not list as Conflicts of Interest the faculty at  your institution and partner institutions as you are already providing this  information in the required lists of personnel and institutions.)</span></li>
<li><span dir="ltr">Other current employment with the  institution (such as consulting or an advisory arrangement).</span></li>

<li><span dir="ltr">Other relationships, such as close  personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgement or be  seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="awst" id="awst"></a> After we submit the preliminary or full proposal, are we  to update this information in FastLane?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> No. Once the preliminary (or full) proposal is submitted,  any changes in the participating institutions, personnel, collaborators,  subcontractors, or other affiliates can&rsquo;t be made to the proposal (preliminary  or full). However, it is important to notify NSF of changes as they occur, for  the purpose of identifying potential conflicts of interest during the review  process.</p>
<p><strong><a name="swnn" id="swnn"></a> Should we notify NSF of changes in personnel or  participating institutions? When should we notify NSF?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> Yes. Updated information should be sent by the lead  institution to <a href="mailto:stc@nsf.gov">stc@nsf.gov</a> as soon as it is available. Updated completed  information will be requested prior to a site visit.</p>
<p><strong class="greysubhd">12. Required Supplementary Documents information for Single Copy  Documents.</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="tppr" id="tppr"></a> The preliminary proposal requires a list of Partner  Institutions and a List of Project Personnel to be submitted as part of the  Supplementary Documents. Is this the same information that is required to be submitted to NSF via email? Why do we enter this  in two places?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> Yes, it is the same information  that is to be submitted to NSF via email. The lists of Partner  Institutions and Project Personnel are required as supplementary documents for  both preliminary and full proposals. Supplementary Documents in FastLane are  PDF files, and can't be used to create the database needed by staff; therefore, the  information must be submitted to NSF in spreadsheet  format, as well (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08580">NSF 08-580</a>, the STC solicitation). 
<p><strong><a name="itif" id="itif"></a> Is the information for the Supplementary Documents and  the Single Copy Documents optional?</strong>
<p><strong> </strong> No. Complete and accurate information is required for both  the preliminary and full proposals submitted to this competition.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">13. Federal Government laboratory partnerships</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="iaii" id="iaii"></a> I am interested in preparing a preliminary proposal for  the new STC Program Solicitation. The Program Solicitation mentions  collaborations and partnerships with National Laboratories. Can you tell me  what limitations apply to these collaborations regarding funding resources? In  particular, is it possible to provide money directly to lab personnel for  salary, travel, and hiring of students and post-docs?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> The STC Program encourages partnerships with Federal  Government laboratories, including the National Laboratories operated by the  Department of Energy. However, NSF does not typically reimburse costs that are  covered by another agency's appropriations. NSF funding of federal employees  such as lab personnel is generally not appropriate (see NSF Grant Policy Manual  616.3).
<p><strong class="greysubhd">14. International collaboration</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="hdnv" id="hdnv"></a> How does NSF view international collaboration?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> Centers are encouraged to engage in cooperative activities  with foreign scientists and organizations whenever it will benefit science or  engineering and not harm United    States competitiveness. Before a Center  engages in any cooperative international activities, the Center Director must  notify the cognizant NSF Program Officer for review and approval. Each Center  must include information about its international activities in it&rsquo;s annual  report; and must use its best efforts to ensure that any collaboration between  the Center and a foreign individual or organization will be conducted on a  comparable access basis.
<p><strong><a name="awad" id="awad"></a> As we are developing our preliminary proposal for an STC,  we had a question concerning international participation. We would like to know  if it is acceptable to include international industries as well as academics in  the STCs.</strong>
<p><strong></strong> There is no problem with either academic or industrial  international collaboration as long as it can be justified as an integral part  of the proposed Center's activities. Many of the currently supported STCs  include both types of international collaboration. However, the foreign  partners, not NSF, must provide funding for international academic or  industrial collaborators.
<p><strong><a name="cafi" id="cafi"></a> Can a foreign institution, as a partner or subcontractor,  be financed with funds from an STC award?</strong>
<p><strong> </strong> NSF does not expect to fund foreign institutions as  partners or subcontractors. Extraordinary circumstances may be considered on a  case-by-case basis, such as activities that require access to unique foreign  facilities, unique foreign data resources not generally available to U.S.  investigators (or which would require significant effort or time to duplicate),  foreign geographic locations, or other foreign resources that are essential  contributing factors to the success of the proposed project.
<p><strong><a name="gswo" id="gswo"></a> Graduate students working on our proposed STC will be  supported as research assistants. I assume that these positions would be open  to any qualified student, foreign or U.S. that we admit to our graduate  programs, as is the case with an NSF grant. If there are restrictions on  appointing research assistants we would like to be made aware of them.</strong>
<p><strong></strong> One of the goals of the STC Program is to increase the  numbers of educated U.S.  citizens by increasing the numbers of U.S. undergraduate students, graduate  students and post-docs engaged in science and engineering. The STC Program  Solicitation does not specifically rule out research assistantships to foreign  students. However, if a proposed Center is to meet the goals of the STC program  for educating U.S. citizens, then the proposed Center should plan for U.S.  citizens (undergraduates and graduates) to be the principal, if not exclusive,  recipients of educational aid and research assistant appointments. It would be  difficult to see how a proposed Center's educational component could be  acceptable if it did not include a large preponderance of U.S. citizens  as beneficiaries.
<p><strong><a name="opcd" id="opcd"></a> Our proposed Center does not include a &quot;fellowship  program&quot; as such. However, we would like to propose paying for  &quot;three-month living stipends&quot; for students from collaborating  institutions in foreign countries to visit members of the Center for  cooperative research and training. If there are any restrictions on this,  please advise.</strong>
<p><strong></strong> In general, the country sending the students is expected to  pay for their travel to and expenses in the receiving country. There are  exceptions for students from countries whose currency is not convertible. The  STC Program rarely supports activities to bring foreign students to the U.S. since one of the goals of the Program is to  educate U.S.  citizens as students and post-docs engaged in science. Extraordinary cases may  be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<p><strong><a name="iiaf" id="iiaf"></a> Is it acceptable for a foreign laboratory to allocate and  pay for a foreign post-graduate fellowship for our proposed STC?</strong>
<p><strong></strong> There is no problem with a foreign laboratory's paying for  foreign post-graduate fellowships at an STC.
<p><strong class="greysubhd">15. Next STC competition</strong><br />
                <img src="/images/bluefade.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="1" vspace="5" border="0"/><br />
<strong><a name="atcs" id="atcs"></a> After the current STC competition is completed, when will  the next STC competition begin?</strong><p><strong></strong> Pending availability of funds, the next STC  competition is expected to start three years from the start of this  competition. The Program Solicitation for the current competition is expected  serve as the Program Solicitation for the next competition, subject to change.  The deadline dates and review schedule for the next competition, although not  yet determined, should be similar to those for the currently announced  competition. The STC web site will be updated with information regarding the  next competition when deadline dates for preliminary proposals and full  proposals are better known.</p>
