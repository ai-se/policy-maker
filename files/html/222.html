<h4>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h4>


<p><em><strong>THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR AN HONORARY AWARDS PROGRAM.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) ADMINISTERS THE PAESMEM AWARD PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY (OSTP).</strong></p>

<p>Within this solicitation, the word "proposal", "proposer", "application", or "applicant" may be used in place of the word "nomination", "nominator" or "nominee". The PAESMEM program accepts nominations in lieu of proposals or applications. PAESMEM is a honorific awards program and is exempt from NSF merit review criteria. See review criteria for nominations in Section VI of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PAESMEM recognizes individuals for their mentoring of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, persons with disabilities, and persons from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields are African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives. Students, teachers, early career scientists, engineers and/or other STEM or STEM-related professionals are eligible mentees. <em>(Early career scientists, technicians, mathematicians, engineers and STEM or STEM-related professionals include the following categories: post-associate, post-baccalaureate, post-masters, post-doctoral, new STEM faculty, new STEM K-12 teachers (both pre- and in-service), in public and private sectors. Nominations should clearly identify the early career professional mentored.)</em></p><p>Nominations for the PAESMEM award may be submitted by any individual U.S. citizen or permanent resident or affiliated organization conducting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM or STEM-related) mentoring activities in formal and/or informal settings. Nominations must demonstrate exemplary, measurable mentoring over a sustained 5 year period at a minimum. </p>
<p>Any U.S. citizen or permanent resident who has done exemplary, measurable mentoring over a sustained 5 year period is eligible for nomination, including federal employees (with some exceptions), military employees or organizations and individuals and organizations in the private sector with outstanding mentoring programs and activities.</p>
<p>Nominators may submit the names of potential nominees - both individuals and organizations - via the PAESMEM on-line community website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.PAESMEM.net">www.PAESMEM.net</a> during the open nomination period. Self-nominations will also be accepted via this website.  Full nominations must be submitted via FastLane or Grants.gov by the closing nomination submission deadline of Friday, June 17, 2016.  All nominations must be submitted by 5:00 P. M. (proposer's local time).  Nominations submitted at 5:01 P. M. (proposer's local time) will not be accepted by FastLane starting January 25, 2016.</p>
<p>Federal employees (with some exceptions), military employees or organizations and individuals and organizations in the private sector with outstanding mentoring programs and activities are eligible to submit nominations for the PAESMEM award. </p>
<p>Former recipients of the "individual" PAESMEM award are not eligible for re-nomination. Former recipients of the "Organizational" PAESMEM award may be re-nominated 10 years from receiving an initial or subsequent award. Both individuals and organizations may self-nominate.</p>
<p>Performance (outcome/impact) data are required for all nominations. Organizational nominations require demonstration of rigorous evaluation and assessment over the course of the required 5 year (or more) period of sustained mentoring activity. Organizational nominations must differentiate the organization's mentoring activities and accomplishments from those of individualized achievements.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
<p>The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) recognizes those who have made significant contributions to mentoring and thereby support the future and productivity of the U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics, (STEM) workforce. The program was created to identify and recognize individuals and organizations that have contributed outstanding efforts in mentoring and have enhanced the participation of individuals (including persons with disabilities) who might not otherwise have considered or had access to opportunities in STEM disciplines and professions.  </p>
<p>In June 2015, fifteen new awardees (14 individuals and 1 organization) were recognized by the White House for their exceptional mentoring contributions which aid in diversifying the nation's workforce. Cumulatively, over 250 individuals and organizations have received this distinguished Presidential recognition serving as exemplars to their colleagues and leaders in the national effort to develop more fully the nation's human resources in STEM.</p>
<p>The PAESMEM community's exemplary mentoring accomplishments reinforce and undergird OSTP's engagement of the public in making noteworthy contributions to the development of the STEM enterprise while broadening the participation of individuals in all pathways of STEM learning. Nominations are evaluated and awardees selected for impact, significance and high quality mentoring achievements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The PAESMEM award is bestowed for past mentoring achievements as opposed to implementation of future mentoring activities.</em> <em>Proposals for research on mentoring in STEM disciplines and new mentoring implementation projects, including conference proposals, may be submitted to NSF under the Grant Proposal Guide, NSF 16-1. Please contact PAESMEM program officers to discuss funding opportunities prior to proposal submission. </em></p>

PAESMEM.net is <strong>NOT</strong> an avenue for submission of the official nomination. </p>
<p><strong>Mentoring Resources</strong></p>
<p>PAESMEM.net serves as a resource for the STEM mentoring community. Historical resources, such as the white paper prepared by PAESMEM awardees in 2006 entitled<em> "Mentoring for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Workforce Development and Lifelong Productivity: Success across the K through Grey Continuum",</em> which defines mentoring at varying pathways and differing sectors, is available on the PAESMEM.net website.  Most states are represented among the current PAESMEM awardees. Contacting a mentor in your state may lead to a productive collaboration in developing a highly competitive individual or organizational nomination. You may also contact NSF's PAESMEM Team at <a href="mailto:paesmem@nsf.gov">paesmem@nsf.gov</a> or the PAESMEM community manager at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?mailto:communitymanager@paesmem.net">communitymanager@paesmem.net</a> for alumni recommendations.</p>

Comprehensive information about using Grants.gov is available on the Grants.gov Applicant Resources webpage: <a href="http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants.html">http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants.html</a>. In addition, the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide (see link in Section V.A) provides instructions regarding the technical preparation of proposals via Grants.gov. For Grants.gov user support, contact the Grants.gov Contact Center at 1-800-518-4726 or by email: <a href="mailto:support@grants.gov">support@grants.gov</a>. The Grants.gov Contact Center answers general technical questions related to the use of Grants.gov. Specific questions related to this program solicitation should be referred to the NSF program staff contact(s) listed in Section VIII of this solicitation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Submitting the Proposal:</strong></em> Once all documents have been completed, the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) must submit the application to Grants.gov and verify the desired funding opportunity and agency to which the application is submitted. The AOR must then sign and submit the application to Grants.gov. The completed application will be transferred to the NSF FastLane system for further processing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proposers that submitted via FastLane are strongly encouraged to use FastLane to verify the status of their submission to NSF. For proposers that submitted via Grants.gov, until an application has been received and validated by NSF, the Authorized Organizational Representative may check the status of an application on Grants.gov. After proposers have received an e-mail notification from NSF, Research.gov should be used to check the status of an application.</p>

        <h3>VI. PAESMEM REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
        <p>PAESMEM nominations will be reviewed by a panel of mentoring and STEM experts for the overall impact, significance, and quality of the mentoring activities described in the nomination materials. </p>
        <a name="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The review criteria are as follows for <strong><em>"Individual"</em></strong> nominations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Are the impacts and outcomes of the mentoring outstanding?</li>
<li><strong>Significance:</strong> Are the mentoring accomplishments above and beyond what would be expected for other individuals in similar positions?</li>
<li><strong>Quality:</strong> How well has the nominee designed, tailored, and implemented the mentoring activities and strategies for the targeted mentees?</li>
</ul>
<p>The review criteria are as follows for <strong><em>"Organizational"</em></strong> nominations"</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Are the impacts and outcomes of the mentoring outstanding?</li>
<li><strong>Significance: </strong>Are the mentoring activities and strategies regarded as exemplars with potential for wider implementation? Are the mentoring accomplishments above and beyond what would be expected for other organizations of similar scope? Does this organization have a model that has the potential for wider implementation?</li>
<li><strong>Quality:</strong> How well has the nominee designed, tailored, and implemented the mentoring activities and strategies for the targeted mentees? How well has the organization assessed the impacts of the mentoring activities?</li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Panel Review</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to write a review giving the strengths and weaknesses of the nomination. The Program Officer assigned to manage the nomination's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the nominee by the Program Director. After review and consideration of appropriate factors, NSF provides advice to the President on recommendations for the awards.</p>

          IX. OTHER INFORMATION
        </h3><p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
<p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov may be obtained at <a href="http://www.grants.gov">http://www.grants.gov</a>.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
