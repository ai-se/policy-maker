        <p><strong>Important Reminders</strong></p>
        <p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 18, 2011. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding opportunity. </p>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG has been revised to implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing. Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to assess the scope of the project, all organizational resources necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal. The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information. Mandatory cost sharing will only be required when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director. See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) </em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2gxi">Chapter II.C.2.g(xi)</a> for further information about the implementation of these recommendations.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG contains a clarification of NSF's long standing data policy. All proposals must describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan. The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as appropriate. Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter II.C.2.j</a> of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
        <p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals. Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter II.C.2.j</a> of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is partnering with the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) to support collaborative research between US and Israeli investigators in areas of biology supported by the NSF Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. The Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) supports research aimed at an integrative understanding of organisms.  The goal is to predict why organisms are structured the way they are, and function as they do. Projects that innovatively apply systems biology approaches, i.e. approaches that combine experimentation, computation, and modeling, and which lead to new conceptual and theoretical insights and predictions about integrated organismal properties that may be experimentally verified, are particularly encouraged.</p>
          <p>In the context of greater accessibility to ever-expanding and increasingly detailed biological information, the overriding objective of IOS is to support research to understand the fundamental nature of life by understanding the emergent properties of organisms. Some of these properties include but are not restricted to: complexity (how interwoven organismal components or processes produce more than a sum of their parts), robustness (the degree to which an organism resists perturbation or stressful influences); communication (the processes that enable individual components in a system to instruct one another or alter one another's behavior); resilience (the ability to recover from perturbation or stress), adaptability (the capacity of organisms to change in response to perturbations in ways that maintain overall organismal integrity), and cooperation (behaviors of cells or organisms that benefit more than the individual). These emergent properties can be understood through studies of the evolution, development, behavior, regulatory processes and structural properties of all organisms. Therefore comparative studies and the use of a wide variety of organisms as models are encouraged.</p>
          <p>Understanding these emergent, systems properties of organisms requires integrative, interdisciplinary approaches. The Division encourages proposals that include analyses across multiple levels of biological organization, from molecular through ecological, theoretical as well as advanced computational techniques, and interdisciplinary collaborations involving scientists from all areas of biology, behavioral science, physical science, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.          </p>
          <p>            The scientific emphases of IOS are:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>          BSF supports a wide range of basic research, including the areas of biology supported by IOS. Proposers are encouraged to consult the IOS (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?org=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?org=IOS</a>) and BSF (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.bsf.org.il/BSFPublic/Default.aspx">http://www.bsf.org.il/BSFPublic/Default.aspx</a>) program descriptions prior to development of a proposal. </p>
          
          <p>Proposals are expected to include substantial collaborative activities between US and Israeli investigators. Proposers are strongly encouraged to develop joint activities that are syngergistic and have added value over and above individual activities. Proposals that address aspects of organism-enviroment interactions and organismal adaptation are especially encouraged.</p>

        <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the importance of international collaboration in promoting scientific discovery, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) seek to enhance opportunities for collaborative activities in organismal biology between US and Israeli investigators.                     The NSF Division of Integrative Organismal Systems will accept new bilateral collaborative research proposals with BSF that are not currently funded by other sources. The proposed projects must have clear relevance to science supported by IOS and BSF as well as a clear synergy over and above projects funded by the individual agencies. Proposals that address aspects of organism-enviroment interactions and organismal adaptation are especially encouraged.<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        </p>
        <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to enhance opportunities for collaborative activities between US and Israeli investigators. Towards this goal, the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) in the Biological Sciences Directorate at NSF and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) are partnering to support collaborative projects between US and Israeli investigators in areas of research supported by IOS and BSF. </p>
        <p>The International Collaborations in Organismal Biology (ICOB) seeks new and highly innovative three-year collaborative projects that break new ground, make use of unique resources and capabilities in Israel and the US, and demonstrate a high level of synergy between the collaborating investigators. Formation of new collaborations is strongly encouraged. The ICOB program will only accept basic research proposals that clearly fit the scope of the following programmatic areas in IOS:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Behavioral Systems</li>
          <li>Developmental Systems</li>
          <li>Neural Systems</li>
          <li>Physiological and Structural Systems</li>
          <li>Plant Genome Research</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A description of these programmatic areas can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS</a>. Both the NSF and BSF (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.bsf.org.il/BSFPublic/Default.aspx">http://www.bsf.org.il/BSFPublic/Default.aspx</a>) web pages should be consulted carefully to ensure programmatic fit prior to submission of a preliminary proposal. <strong>Principal Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact a Program Director to confirm the suitability of a project for this competition prior to submission of a preliminary proposal.</strong></p>
        <p>Investigators who have been collaborators in the past must demonstrate in the preliminary proposal and full proposal (if encouraged) that the proposed project represents a new research direction for the collaborative team and is not a continuation of ongoing studies. The ICOB Program will <em>not</em> accept proposals that overlap significantly with projects currently funded by NSF or BSF. </p>
        <p>The ICOB Program requires that US applicants allocate significant financial resources in their requested budget to ensure meaningful participation of students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior investigators, including those from underrepresented groups, in the proposed collaboration through extended research visits of 3-10 weeks in the international collaborator's laboratory. The ICOB Program also encourages the development and use of infrastructure to increase the synergy of the proposed research.</p>

        <p><strong>Preliminary Proposal Review Procedure</strong></p>
        <p>The preliminary proposals will be reviewed by NSF and BSF. At NSF, the preliminary proposals will be reviewed programmatically for their fit with research areas supported by IOS. A detailed description of IOS programs can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IOS</a>. </p>
        <p>The preliminary proposals will also be reviewed to ensure that the proposed projects do not overlap significantly with projects that are already funded by NSF or other US funding agencies. The Program will discourage submission of full proposals if the proposed research is considered an incremental advance over currently-funded research in the US PI's laboratory. Upon completion of the review preliminary proposals, NSF and BSF will make a joint decision whether to encourage or discourage submission of full proposals to the ICOB Program. While submitters of both favorably and unfavorably reviewed preliminary proposals are eligible to submit full proposals, before deciding to proceed, PIs are urged to carefully consider the feedback to make sure concerns can be addressed in a full proposal. Investigators will be notified of the decision 60 days prior to the full proposal submission deadline whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
        <p><a name="reviewcrit"></a></p>
        <h4>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgments.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
            How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
          <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
            How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
        <p>Mentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>
        <a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
        <p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
            One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
          </p>
          <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
            Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review. </p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        <p>NSF will coordinate and manage the review of proposals jointly with BSF. Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared between the participating organizations as appropriate.</p>
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
        <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program.

        <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        <h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
