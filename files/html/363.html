          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>Over the past decade of its authorized award life, the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) has enabled major discoveries, innovations, and contributions to education and commerce by providing researchers from academia, small and large companies, and government with open access to university user facilities with leading-edge fabrication and characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise within all disciplines of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. The National Science Foundation is now moving forward with the new National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) as the successor to the NNIN.</p>
          <p>The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) 2014 Strategic Plan<sup>(1)</sup> emphasizes the importance and critical need for the U.S. to sustain a dynamic infrastructure and toolset to advance nanotechnology, and in particular the academic infrastructure represented by NNIN. In addition, the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) 2014 Report<sup>(2)</sup> to the President and Congress on the Fifth Assessment of the NNI recommends strong support for nanoscale infrastructure networks such as NNIN to ensure the effective training of a new generation of transdisciplinary scientists and engineers.</p>
          <p>NSF sought input from the science and engineering community on a possible future nanotechnology infrastructure support program through a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL 14-068). A workshop was then conducted of recognized national experts to develop a vision of how such a future program could be structured and to identify the key needs for the user communities over the coming decade.<sup>(3)</sup><sup> </sup></p>
          <p>With this background and community input, NSF has developed this solicitation to create the NNCI. The solicitation establishes a competition for individual university user facility sites positioned across the nation. A Coordinating Office will then be selected competitively at a later stage from among the selected sites to enhance their impact as a national infrastructure of user facility sites. The ultimate selection of user facility sites will include capabilities and instrumentation addressing current and anticipated future user needs across the broad areas of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology.</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p><strong>Overall Approach to the NNCI</strong></p>
          <p>The competition for individual sites will be for consideration of large and small university-based user facilities, including those at minority-serving institutions, that are geographically distributed and with diverse and complementary capabilities to support current and anticipated future user needs across the broad spectrum of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology domains. The selected individual sites will have autonomy in their operation and management, but will be required to act in concert with a Coordinating Office that will be separately competed and chosen at a later stage. Some sites may choose to partner with facilities at regional or smaller institutions that would bring specific capabilities for users and benefits to student training. The overall collection of selected sites and their capabilities will provide users with cost-effective access both to the specialized tools, processes, and expertise to support complex multi-step fabrication at the nanoscale level for structures, materials, devices, and systems, as well as to the associated instrumentation for characterization, analysis, and probing at these dimensions. The program aims to make these capabilities broadly available to the nation&rsquo;s researchers in academe, industry, and government to help catalyze new discoveries in science and engineering and to stimulate technological innovation.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Capabilities in the Coordinated Infrastructure</strong></p>
          <p>The broad spectrum of domain capabilities in this coordinated infrastructure is intended to encompass: physical-, chemical-, and biological-based nanostructures, materials, devices, and systems; electronic, optical, photonic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, chemical, bioengineering, biomedical, and fluidic nanodevices and systems; nanoscale building blocks and nanostructured materials, composites, coatings, and surfaces; geophysical, geochemical, and environmental nanostructures and processes; synthetic biology, and fabrication in soft matter including biological interfaces; heterogeneous integration of complex, three-dimensional nanoscale systems to create new functionality; hierarchical design and fabrication to build nanoscale systems across multiple dimensional scales, including modeling and simulation tools that complement and support these activities; prototyping, process integration, and testing of manufacturing concepts, including high-speed roll-to-roll fabrication processes; and other areas, as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Some promising research opportunities that could be enabled include: formation of new system architectures and heterogeneous materials, engineered at the nanoscale to integrate formerly disparate electronic, photonic, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties into nanosystems, for functions such as energy conversion and storage, dissipation of heat, precision sensing, and local actuation; bio-inspired, self-healing, responsive materials; structures and devices supporting research in the life sciences and biomedical applications; synthesis of nanoparticles for study of nanotoxicity; sensors for environmental science and monitoring; ultrafast sensors for imaging and recording of chemical, physiological, and biochemical processes; new, more energy efficient devices and circuits for communication, storage and processing of digital information, including quantum information; and devices and circuits for new information processing architectures such as neuromorphic computing.</p>
          <p>Some of the sites will have widely used nanofabrication capabilities applicable to diverse areas, while some sites may offer critical, highly specialized tools and processes to support a focused subset of nanoscience and technology. They will enable support for exploration and development of potential new applications of nanotechnology. Appropriate characterization techniques should be intended principally in feedback control of fabrication processes, though access may be needed in specific fields to unique, valuable, and specialized characterization capabilities, either on-site or by remote operation.</p>
          <p><strong>Considerations for Individual Site Proposals</strong></p>
          <p>Proposing institutions are encouraged to include a broad range of technical capabilities in their individual user facility site proposals, but can also choose to focus on particular subfields within their areas of expertise. Some sites may choose to partner with facilities at regional or smaller institutions that would bring specific capabilities for users and benefits to student training. The Site Director, who is the Principal Investigator for the individual site proposal, will be the key individual for management of the individual site and will work in concert with the other Site Directors and the Coordinating Office, and with the NSF.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Important: Please see &ldquo;Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources&rdquo; section in this Solicitation for requirements of facilities and equipment.</em></strong></p>
          <p>Sites should demonstrate that they have the ability to manage shared user facilities and to understand and serve the needs of external users, including those from companies as well as from academia. They should highlight how they will support a rich user base with broad accessibility and affordable user fee structure. They should show how NSF funds will leverage those of the university and other resources to grow the numbers of external users. Sites must embrace a culture of open access to researchers for any research project of merit, with protection of intellectual property, and mechanisms for encouraging non-traditional users from diverse disciplines. They should have an organizational structure that allows coordination of complex process steps and tools for integrated tasks, and acceptance of experimental risks associated with non-standard processes and materials. They should have strong underlying internal research programs that provide critical research mass and knowledge base in developing new processes, methodologies, and instrumentation. They should have a plan for supporting a professional technical staff with requisite expertise to enable external users to plan and carry out experiments with a rapid cycle time, and to instruct in laboratory safety, process methods, and instrumentation usage. Sites should provide an accessible web portal to instruct potential users how to gain access to the facility, and to describe the facility&rsquo;s technical capabilities, tools, and instrumentation. They should have a plan for data management and sharing of the products of research. They should also have methods for assessment and quantifiable metrics of overall site performance and impact, including those for educational and outreach activities.</p>
          <p>Nanotechnology facilities provide unique opportunities to infuse innovative education with research at the frontiers of the field. Sites should provide clear, focused strategies for integrating forefront science and engineering with education, including plans for assessing effectiveness and spreading promising practices. Learning experiences, resources, and tools for graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates, as well as educational outreach and workforce development plans, should leverage the unique strengths of their user facility. These may address, for example, engaging participants in community colleges, pre-college grades, informal science settings, and international education experiences. Sites should also provide outreach programs to potential users in the broader science and engineering communities, including those from startups and small businesses, whose work could benefit from advanced fabrication and instrumentation capabilities. They should assess and utilize regional needs and opportunities to broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering among students, faculty, staff, management, and in outreach activities. The sites should have plans for knowledge dissemination to the broader research, education, and technology communities.  They should demonstrate how they will complement and connect to other local resources, such as business incubators, prototyping, and manufacturing facilities. The range and scope of the education and outreach activities are expected to be commensurate with the size of the requested budgets.</p>
          <p>Sites having particular expertise in the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology are encouraged to integrate the instruction and study of those aspects into their proposals that can leverage their user community base, and which relate to the capabilities of their respective user facilities.</p>
          <p><strong>Role of the Coordinating Office </strong></p>
          <p>Following selection and award of the individual sites, NSF will hold a meeting of the Site Directors to discuss recommendations to significantly enhance the impact of this investment that will lead to a coordinated national infrastructure of user facility sites for nanotechnology. A Coordinating Office, to be located at one of the awarded institution sites, will then be competed and chosen to provide the coordinating function. The Director of the Coordinating Office will be a key individual for developing management strategies and operational plans in concert with the Site Directors of the individual user facilities, and will serve as a principal contact person with the NSF.</p>
          <p>The Coordinating Office will be responsible for establishing a comprehensive web portal to ensure close linkage among the individual facility websites such that they present a unified face to the user community of overall capabilities, tools, and instrumentation. It will also work with all sites in ways to guide users regarding which site or sites, which instruments, and which processes would enable users to complete their projects most successfully. The Office will help to coordinate and disseminate best practices for national-level education and outreach programs across sites, as well as the instruction and study of social and ethical implications of nanotechnology. It will seek to harmonize capabilities for modeling and simulation in nanoscale fabrication and characterization across sites, and provide effective coordination with the NSF-supported Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). The Office will establish an external advisory board of distinguished members from academia, industry, and government to provide advice and guidance through the Coordinating Office.</p>
          <p>The Office will work with the individual sites to establish uniform methods for assessment and quantifiable metrics of overall site performance and impact, including those for educational and outreach activities. It will help to share best practices and laboratory safety and training procedures across all sites. It will engage all sites in a planning process to explore emerging areas of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology that can lead to future growth of the external user base. It will coordinate the acquisition needs for specialized instrumentation across all sites to enhance new areas of research growth. The Office will also coordinate data management across all sites and the dissemination of shared knowledge to research, education, and technology communities, as well as in enhancing connections with other nationally funded academic centers or networks and facilities supported by government, the private sector, and international partners.</p>
        
        
        <h3> <a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
         
          <p>Approximately $16 million total funds will be available in this competition for each year of a five-year duration of FY 2015-2019, depending on the availability of funds. NSF intends to provide individual awards to support approximately 10-15 university user facility sites at a range of $500,000 to a maximum of $2,000,000 per year, depending on the plans and scope of their capabilities.

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In responding to the above NSF review criteria, reviewers will be asked to place emphasis on the following additional criteria for individual site proposals:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Strength of fabrication and characterization capabilities provided, including those for a specific focus on subfields.</li>
       <li> Commitment of the institution to providing the necessary infrastructure for the shared user facility.</li>
        <li> Relevance of modeling and simulation capabilities supporting fabrication and characterization.</li>
       <li>Quality of educational experiences afforded, including attention to broadening participation.</li>
      <li> Quality of plans for outreach and knowledge dissemination.</li>
      <li> Quality of plans for inclusion of social and ethical implications studies, if applicable.</li>
     <li> Strength of supportive internal research programs and faculty.</li>
        <li> Effectiveness of management structure, plans, and ability to ensure high-quality external user services.</li>
        <li>Appropriateness of plans for assessment and metrics of site performance and impact, and for determining future needs.</li>
     <li> Appropriateness of the budget for accomplishing the work set forth in the proposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>The review process will involve a combination of adhoc mail and panel review followed by a reverse site review panel. </p>
      
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, Cooperative Support Branch for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a cooperative agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, Cooperative Support Branch. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
       <p> <strong>TBD - Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>Cooperative Agreement - Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions for Large Facilities apply.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year awards, the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of an award , the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>Post-award oversight will consist of an annual review by a reverse-site-review panel of external experts at NSF, although some on-site reviews may be held. A Business Systems Review will be held once within the five-year period of the award. The awardee will submit comprehensive annual project reports to NSF in advance of each annual review. The annual project reports will contain a program plan and budget for the next-year&rsquo;s funding increment. </p>
        <p>Cooperative Agreement - Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions for Large Facilities apply.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects.

        <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
