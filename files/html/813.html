            tenure by the specified time period may re-apply to the program as

            for each of not more than two dependent children for 12 months. The 
            level of funding&nbsp;for Fellows will be determined based on the 
            Fellow's status at the time of application. Any increase in the number 
            of dependents after the deadline date of submission of the proposal 
            will not qualifiy for the dependency allowance. Adjustment for individuals 
            entitled to sabbatical leave pay or whose employer wishes to supplement 
            the stipend to match regular salary will be considered. NSF-NATO funding

      href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</A> 
          for a listing of the certifications). The AOR must provide the required 
          electronic certifications within five working days following the electronic 
          submission of the proposal. Proposers are no longer required to provide 
          a paper copy of the signed Proposal Cover Sheet to NSF. Further instructions

        <A name=reviewcrit></A> <H4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</H4>
        <A name=reviewproc></A> <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited 
          from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research 
          or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers 
          charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer 
          to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate 
          reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts 
          with the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from 
          non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent 
          disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
        <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating 
          proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?ods_key=nsb9772">NSB 97-72</A>). 
          All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit review 
          criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria 
          as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs 
          and activities. </P>
        <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued Important Notice 127, Implementation 
          of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts 
          Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing 
          both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted 
          to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure 
          that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding 
          decisions.</P>
        <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 
          2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines 
          relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. 
          Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must 
          address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the 
          one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader 
          impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the 
          Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
        <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals 
          that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the 
          Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation 
          and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance 
          of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
        <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed 
          below (see the <A 
      href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</A> 
          Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations 
          that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not 
          all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both 
          merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those 
          considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and 
          for which he/she is qualified to make judgements.</P>
        <UL>
          <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
          How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
          within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified 
          is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, 
          the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what 
          extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original 
          concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? 
          Is there sufficient access to resources?

          How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while

          activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., 
          gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will 
          it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, 
          instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated 
          broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What 
          may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? 
        </UL>
        <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making 
          funding decisions:</P>
        <UL>
          <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
          One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster 
          integration of research and education through the programs, projects, 
          and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These 
          institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently 
          assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and 
          where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the 
          excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of 
          learning perspectives.

        <UL>
          <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
          Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens 
          -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities 
          -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. 
          NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central 
          to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

        <H4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer 
          Service Standard</H4>
        <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons 
          outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the 
          proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation 
          will be reviewed by <SPAN class=user_input><A 
      id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc and/or panel review. </SPAN></P>
        <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support 
          or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the 
          proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate 
          a recommendation.</P>
        <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted 
          by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential 
          documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, 
          are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program 
          Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the 
          decision to award or decline funding.</P>
        <P>In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after 
          his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved 
          by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee 
          of an eventual award. </P>
        <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals 
          have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The 
          time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when 
          the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
        <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
          recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants 
          and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications 
          and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers 
          are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, 
          obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure 
          of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical 
          or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator 
          or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the 
          absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants 
          and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

        <P>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any 
          special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments 
          thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories 
          of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates 
          any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) 
          the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award 
          conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal 
          Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement 
          or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award 
          letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance 
          with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic 
          mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations

          Requirements</H4>
        <P>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), 
          the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program 
          Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. 
        </P>
        <A name=grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt></A> <P>Within 90 days after the expiration 
          of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final project report. 
          Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing 
          of pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of 
          the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data. 
        </P>
        <P>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, 
          available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual 
          and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission 
          and updating of project reports, including information on project participants 
          (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications, 
          and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required 
          to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal 
          or in earlier updates using the electronic system. </P>

        <H3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</H3>
        <P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education 
          in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible 
          for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for 
          publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for 
          such findings or their interpretation. </P>
        <P>NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and 
          educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and 
          persons with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance 
          with Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds 
          of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded 
          from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
          discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance 
          from NSF (unless otherwise specified in the eligibility requirements 
          for a particular program).</P>
        <P>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities 
          (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
          persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including 
          student research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See 
          the program announcement/solicitation for further information.</P>
        <P>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf 
          (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that 
          enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the 
          Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD 
          may be accessed at (703) 292-5090, FIRS at 1-800-877-8339.</P>
        <P>The National Science Foundation is committed to making all of the information 
          we publish easy to understand. If you have a suggestion about how to 
          improve the clarity of this document or other NSF-published materials,
