          SUMMARY OF PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
        </h3>
        <h4>
          General Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>IUSE/Professional Formation of Engineers:  REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (IUSE/PFE: RED) 
            
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>In FY 2017, NSF is continuing a program aligned with the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework: <em>REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments</em>. This funding opportunity enables engineering and computer science departments to lead the nation by successfully achieving significant sustainable changes necessary to overcome longstanding issues in their undergraduate programs and educate inclusive communities of engineering and computer science students prepared to solve 21st-&shy;century challenges.</p>
            <p>In 2014, ENG launched an initiative, the <em>Professional Formation of Engineers </em>(PFE), to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21st century. At the same time, in 2014, NSF launched the agency&shy;-wide Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework, which is a comprehensive effort to accelerate improvements in the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate education in all STEM fields. The RED program was first offered in FY 2015 as a PFE initiative aligned with the IUSE framework. Additional programs have been created within the IUSE framework across NSF, such as the IUSE: EHR program within EHR.</p>
            <p>Even as demographic and regional socio&shy;economic factors affect engineering and computer science departments in unique ways, there are certain tenets of sustainable change that are common across institutions. For instance, the development and engagement of the entire faculty within a department are paramount to the process, and faculty must be incentivized. Departmental cultural barriers to change and to inclusion of students <em>and </em>faculty from different backgrounds must be identified and addressed. Finally, coherent technical and professional threads must be developed and woven across the four years, especially (1) in the core technical courses of the middle two years, (2) in internship opportunities in the private and public sectors, and (3) in research opportunities with faculty. These and other threads aim to ensure that students develop deep knowledge in their discipline more effectively and meaningfully, while at the same time building their capacities for 21st&shy; century and &#147;T&shy;-shaped&#148; professional skills, including design, leadership, communication, understanding historical and contemporary social contexts, lifelong learning, professional ethical responsibility, creativity, entrepreneurship, and multidisciplinary teamwork. It is expected that, over time, the awardees of this program will create knowledge concerning sustainable change in engineering and computer science education that can be scaled and adopted nationally across a wide variety of academic institutions. The research on departmental change that results from these projects should inform change more broadly across the STEM disciplines.</p>
            <p>Note: The RED program is offered in alignment with the NSF-&shy;wide undergraduate STEM education initiative, <em>Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE)</em>. More information about IUSE can be found in the Introduction of this solicitation. The IUSE/PFE: RED program will hereafter be referred to as RED.</p>
            <p>Prospective PIs are encouraged to consider the IUSE: EHR program for projects that are outside the scope of RED (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505082">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505082</a>). Specifically, the Institutional and Community Transformation (ICT) track promotes innovative approaches to using research to catalyze change that addresses challenges across and within institutions (institutional transformation), as well as within and across specific disciplines (community transformation).</p>
            <p><strong>Prospective PIs are strongly discouraged from submitting identical or substantially similar proposals to RED and IUSE: EHR.</strong> </p>

         I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Over the past several decades various studies, reports, and initiatives on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and diversity were led by the National Science Board, the National Academies, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, think tanks, and others. Over time, the messages are similar, and in some cases identical. They have brought to the forefront the acute awareness of national grand challenges and of the structural disconnect between STEM workforce needs and student engagement and preparation to meet those needs. However, many of these studies explore STEM more broadly and not the unique aspects of "S," "T," "E," and "M."</p>
          <p>The "E" in STEM, Engineering, has many unique aspects. Engineers' abilities in design and systems thinking enable them to utilize their integrative, creative capacity to leverage technology in improving quality of life for people and sustainability of the environment. Because of engineers' immediate ability to contribute professionally upon graduation, the BS degree in engineering (including software engineering) is distinctive as a professional degree with eligibility to qualify for the Professional Engineer (PE) license <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>
          <p>With respect to computer science, the growing support for "CS+X" curricular approaches acknowledges the intersection of computer science and other disciplines, including the humanities. CS+X majors acknowledge the increasingly ubiquitous nature of computing, with applications in virtually any field imaginable, and allow students to tackle the increasingly complicated socio-technical challenges that will confront them professionally. Additionally, the array of engagement and recruitment efforts over the last several years has resulted in a surge of enrollment in CS departments across the country. Undergraduate institutions must devise innovative means of offering effective CS education to a much larger student body.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in the high-&shy;tech environment upon which the global economy is based, the perennial debate about workforce shortages of engineers and computer scientists requires a more precise understanding of dynamic industry needs and of the abilities of departments to address them. Finally, the inclusion of persons from groups underrepresented in most disciplines of engineering and computer science has remained a stubborn, longstanding issue, especially in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science.</p>
          <p>Therefore, NSF is taking a holistic look at how engineers and computer scientists are being prepared for lifelong careers in technical and socio-technical professions. It seeks to respond to the perennial call from different stakeholders (e.g., industry, the public, government, and the profession itself) for professional formation of engineers and computer scientists with a broad set of professional abilities. It seeks to address the fact that the percentages of persons from underrepresented groups entering into - and remaining in - the practice of engineering and computer science are still unacceptably low, impacting the future health of the national workforce.</p>
          <p>To address these and related matters, in 2014, ENG launched an initiative, the <em>Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE)</em>, to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21st century. The engineering and computer science professions must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs, and they must be equally open and available to all. The RED program was first offered in FY 2015 as a PFE initiative aligned with the IUSE framework. The RED program is a cross-directorate program, as multiple directorates at NSF support formation of engineers and computer scientists and institutional transformation as part of their overall strategies.</p>
          <p>The importance of the undergraduate experience for preparing both a diverse STEM workforce equipped for innovation and a STEM &shy;literate public ready to support and benefit from the progress of science is described in a number of key reports and documents [e.g., <em>Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Revisited </em>(National Research Council, 2010); <em>Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation </em>(National Research Council, 2011); <em>Engage to Excel </em>(President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012); <em>Discipline&shy;-based Education Research </em>(National Research Council, 2012); <em>Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education 5&shy;-Year Strategic Plan </em>(National Science and Technology Council, Committee on STEM Education, 2013)].</p>
          <p><em>Improving </em><em>Undergraduate </em><em>STEM </em><em>Education </em>(IUSE) is NSF's comprehensive, Foundation-&shy;wide framework for an integrated vision of the agency's investments in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The key guiding principle of IUSE is to ensure focused, strategic investments that address the greatest challenges in U.S. undergraduate STEM education. The long-&shy;term goals of the IUSE framework are to: 1) improve STEM learning and learning environments, 2) broaden participation and institutional capacity for STEM learning, and 3) build the professional STEM workforce for tomorrow. Collectively, IUSE programs will 1) build core knowledge, 2) implement and scale evidence-&shy;based practices, 3) catalyze departmental and institutional transformation, 4) provide scholarships, and 5) promote disciplinary research experiences. NSF expects that investments within the IUSE portfolio will be informed by theories and findings from education research with attention to the needs and directions of frontier science and engineering research. New knowledge about both learning and implementation will be developed across all IUSE investments through a vibrant partnership of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and education experts.</p>
          <p>In FY 2017, IUSE will</p>
          <ul>
          <li> Expand the emphasis on bringing evidence-&shy;based practices to scale for both the general improvement of STEM learning, and also to expand effective discipline-&shy;specific innovations;</li>
          <li> Focus on strategies for engaging undergraduates in their first two years in authentic research experiences both in courses and in other settings; and</li>
      <li>Emphasize broadening participation and workforce development in computer science, engineering, and geosciences.</li></ul>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
      
            <p><strong>A. Professional Formation</strong></p>
      
          <p>The complex problems facing society in the 21st century demand changes to the way engineers and computer scientists are educated. For example, solving the NAE Grand Challenges will require computer scientists and engineers who not only have deep technical knowledge, but also an understanding of the societal and global contexts in which those problems occur. Among the common challenges facing engineering and computer science departments are how to weave both technical and professional skills throughout the curriculum, including skills defined by the ABET outcomes; how to promote and incentivize faculty engagement in the change process; and how to create cultures of inclusion that are welcoming to students and faculty of all types. Revolutionary change is needed in the structure of departments and the way students are educated to meet these challenges.</p>
          <p>Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) and the Pledge of the Computing Professional <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> refer to the formal and informal processes and value systems through which people become engineers and computer scientists respectively. They include the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers and computer scientists to sustain and grow the profession in order to improve quality of life for all people. Professional formation includes, but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Introductions to the profession at any age;</li>
            <li>Acquisition of deep technical and professional skills, knowledge, and abilities in both formal and informal settings/domains;</li>
            <li>Development of outlooks, perspectives, ways of thinking, knowing, and doing;</li>
            <li>Development of identity as a responsibly technical professional; and</li>
            <li>Acculturation to the profession, its standards, and norms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Professional formation occurs within a complex ecosystem that includes formal classrooms; informal settings such as Maker spaces (hands&shy;-on, do-&shy;it&shy;-yourself environments where community members gather to create, invent, and learn <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>); industry settings (including co&shy;-op and internship experiences); as well as early career work, research experiences, mentor/mentee relationships, and sponsor/beneficiary relationships, etc. To facilitate such activities, engineers and computer scientists must understand and navigate this ecosystem for successful professional formation and practice. They must oversee and participate in developing and maintaining this ecosystem, with smooth and clear pathways to and through the profession. Pathways may include formal and informal education, apprenticeship (in some states), credentialing, and licensure.</p>
          <p>NSF is committed to enabling a vibrant technical workforce for the 21st century. To that end, the current ecosystem must be studied and understood. Gaps and barriers to the formation of professional computer scientists and engineers must be identified, and weak &ldquo;target points&rdquo; in the pathways through the profession must be strengthened or eliminated. A &ldquo;target point&rdquo; is a vulnerable transition, or perhaps even an undesirable climate, that can adversely affect students' progress along the path. Example &ldquo;target points&rdquo; include the typical transitions from high school into a two&shy;-year or four&shy;-year engineering or computer science degree program; from two&shy;-year to four&shy;-year institutions; from a BS degree to industry or graduate school; or from a BS or graduate degree to professional licensure <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. A &ldquo;target point&rdquo; also may reflect a formal or informal setting composed of individuals of different backgrounds with little or no guidance on how to interact, or it may reflect narrow conceptions of what engineering is or should be that create strict and non&shy;porous boundaries for the profession.</p>
          <p>One of the &ldquo;target points&rdquo; to successful professional formation is the middle two years of the four year undergraduate experience for computer science and engineering students.  It is during the middle two years where students receive the bulk of their formal technical preparation <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. These middle years are also a critical transition point for transfer students from community colleges. It is a primary attrition point for engineering and computer science majors. During the middle two years, students often find themselves without the context to grasp the big picture surrounding technically focused courses that are widely perceived as &ldquo;real&rdquo;. Moreover, many professional skills -&shy; those that define what a technical professional is and does in the workforce &ndash; are emphasized in the first year but de&shy;emphasized or dropped entirely in the middle two years, only to be picked up again in upper level electives or capstone design experiences. These gaps in the middle years often contribute to confusion and frustration among students. They also have disproportionately negative effects on students for whom both the pathway and the professional destination are brand new experiences for them and their families.The innovations that have been adopted in the first and last year need to be expanded to and integrated with the middle two years. Teams are encouraged to consider the entire curriculum holistically as they focus on the middle years.</p>
          <p>In addition to the target point of the middle years that computer science departments share with engineering, computer science enrollments are burgeoning across the Nation, as a result of growing interest in the field and the increasingly important role that advances in computing are playing in all areas of science, engineering, education, and society. For example, there is growing support for &ldquo;CS+X&rdquo; approaches that acknowledge the intersection of computer science and other disciplines, including the humanities. In an era of social-entrepreneurship and constantly evolving complex socio&shy;-technical challenges, computer science education is moving to better equip students to be successful in this new world. The inescapable technical rigor of the middle years courses does not have to be isolated from the social context and broader inter&shy;- and multi&shy;disciplinary opportunities that are drawing so many students to the field.</p>
          <p>Hence, there is a need to build research capacity to better understand the complexity of the engineering and computer science education ecosystems and how to optimize them. There is a need to understand required change processes in these ecosystems, and once understood, to clearly articulate and implement these change processes. Finally, there is a need to increase welcome and access for groups underrepresented in engineering and computer science practice.</p>
     
            <p><strong>B. Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments</strong></p>
  
          <p>Prior engineering and computer science education research has led to successes in the introductory and capstone years. However, little research has been done to bridge the innovations in introductory&shy; and capstone&shy; level engineering and computer science education across the entire undergraduate experience, including extracurricular professional activities and student transitions in and out of the program. Furthermore, prior research has also revealed the need for faculty development, faculty reward systems, and academic cultures that encourage engagement of faculty and students of diverse backgrounds in the full undergraduate-&shy;level formation process.</p>
          <p>Thus, the goal of REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (RED) is to address the stated challenges and develop well&shy;-functioning departments through faculty development, structural change, and cultural change, with a focus on student success in their professional formation attainment. While the RED program has a focus on the middle two years, approaches should consider the curriculum holistically. Specific activities supported by the RED solicitation may include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establishing convergent technical and professional threads that must be woven across the four years, especially in core technical courses of the middle two years, in internship opportunities in the private and public sectors, and in research opportunities with faculty&#894;</li>
            <li>Exploring strategies for institutional, systemic, and cultural change, including new approaches to faculty governance or department structures and to restructuring faculty incentive or reward systems&#894;</li>
            <li>Exploring collaborative arrangements with industry and other stakeholders who are mutually interested in developing the best possible professional formation environments and opportunities for students&#894;</li>
            <li>Exploring strategies to bridge the engineering and computer science education research-&shy;to-practice gap, primarily through faculty development and adoption of best practices in the professional formation of engineers and computer scientists&#894; and</li>
            <li>Exploring revolutionary means of recruiting and retaining students and faculty reflective of the modern and swiftly changing demographics of the United States.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All these, and other, activities must focus on how to make change adaptable to other departments and institutions and how they impact students of different backgrounds who are navigating the varied pathways through the undergraduate professional formation process. NSF will conduct a site visit at the end of year 3 of the grant to assess progress towards meeting the goals of the project.</p>
      
            <p><strong>C. Key Features of RED</strong></p>
   

            <p>For the RED solicitation, proposed efforts for departmental change should be revolutionary, not incrementally reformist, and strategies should be developed with impact on the student as the focus. Revolutionary means radically, suddenly, or completely new&#894; producing fundamental, structural change&#894; or going outside of or beyond existing norms and principles. Proposed efforts must be grounded in sound educational theory and work to enable a continuous progression of professional formation through the four year experience. Efforts should address 21st-&shy;century and T-&shy;shaped skills (i.e., cross&shy;-disciplinary breadth), and they should be aligned with stakeholder expectations.</p>
    
          <p>The intent of this solicitation is to focus on significant, systemic departmental change as it impacts student success in their professional formation. Proposals should reflect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A clear demonstration of the PI, i.e., the chair/head (or equivalent), as an innovative leader of systemic change in the department to achieve the stated goals of the RED activities.</li>
            <li>An understanding that agents of change come in all forms (faculty, students, staff, administrators, other program partners) and all should be empowered as actors of transformative change.</li>
            <li>An understanding of the role of each of the RED team members in creating change, demonstrating clear and significant contributions from the department head or dean, the engineering or computer science education expert, and the social scientist attuned to departmental dynamics.</li>
            <li>An understanding of the research on how students of diverse backgrounds learn engineering or computer science and what has been previously attempted.</li>
            <li>An understanding of how engineering or computer science education research connects to practice and of barriers to faculty adoption of engineering or computer science education innovations.</li>
            <li>An appreciation that faculty participation, engagement, development, and belief in the scholarship of learning are critical to success.</li>
            <li>An understanding of department organizational and cultural changes needed to create and sustain change.</li>
            <li>An appreciation that curricular and pedagogical changes are not sufficient, and that structural changes are needed in the department&rsquo;s practices to enact change.</li>
            <li>An understanding of the importance of linking to professional practice through involvement of the department&rsquo;s or college&rsquo;s existing Industrial Advisory Board (or equivalent)&#894;</li>
            <li>An acknowledgement of additional example strategies, such as increasing the stature of professor(s) of practice and their role as change agents or connecting the work with professional masters programs.</li>
            <li>A research component that has the potential to inform the academic community more broadly regarding important factors that lead to institutional change.</li>
            <li>An incorporation of sustainability, adaptability, and scalability considerations. Often, successful innovations in engineering and computer science education do not spread much beyond their origin. This problem can be seen in large variations in retention, diversity, and preparation across departments and institutions. Sustainability, adaptability, and scalability are three fundamental characteristics that are necessary for local innovations to have large-scale impacts. It is therefore critical that proposed approaches incorporate sustainability, adaptability, and scalability by design. Scaling should occur both within the department&rsquo;s institution and to other institutions. In addition, it would be important to adapt best practices and strategies from scaling of social innovations, leverage potential power of social and professional networking tools, and synergistic connections with stakeholder networks such as ASEE, NSBE, SWE, SHPE, ASME, IEEE, NCTM, NCWIT, iAAMCS, ACM, CRA, and other organizations. Successful proposals would include creative strategies that maximize the probability of scaling and adaptation for large scale national impacts.</li>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
   
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
  <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
       
        <ul>
          <li>
          <strong>Vision:</strong> How revolutionary is the vision in light of a well-grounded understanding of the history, context, and culture of the department? Revolutionary means radically, suddenly, or completely new; producing fundamental, structural change; or going outside of or beyond existing norms and principles. </div>
          </li>
          <li><strong>PI Team:</strong> Is the RED team complete, with all required expertise? Is each member fully qualified to perform the proposed work? </li>
          <li><strong>Institutional Commitment:</strong> Do the letter(s) of commitment provide evidence of support for the project sufficient to achieve the goals and objectives? </li>
          <li><strong>Connection to Professional Practice:</strong> Is there a sufficient connection in the proposed project to professional practice? For example, what is the extent of involvement of the industrial advisory board, and how has the department involved professors of practice, a professional master&rsquo;s program, or other elements that bridge the gap between engineering or computer science education and practice? </li>
          <li><strong>Faculty Development Plan:</strong> Is faculty development well planned and properly incentivized to build department cultures that support the holistic professional formation of engineers or computer scientists? </li>
          <li><strong>Potential for Success and Sustainability:</strong> How achievable and significant are the proposed changes in the middle two years of the technical core? Is the theory of change valid and well justified? How responsive are the changes to the call to focus on professional skills? Reviewers will take into account justification of the research plan using the literature, comprehensiveness of the plan, institutional leadership commitments, sustainability of change (including leadership changes and financial sustainability), and the propagation roadmap/transferability of change strategies. </li>
          <li><strong>Connection to Research on Engineering and Computer Science Education</strong>: How well-informed are the vision and execution plan by the literature and prior attempts, if applicable, to implement change? Is the expectation of success well-justified? </li>
          <li><strong>Adaptation and Scaling:</strong> How likely is the new knowledge generated about how to change department culture to be received and utilized by others? How well-conceived are the plans for accomplishing this goal? </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the <em>NSF</em> <em>Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Reporting</strong></p>
        <p>As part of the annual report, PIs should include updated institutional profile data as requested in this solicitation. PIs should also include discussion of department dynamics and obstacles or progress in establishing a culture supportive of holistic professional formation of engineers and/or computer scientists.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
