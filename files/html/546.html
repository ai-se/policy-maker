        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) will serve to advance basic research in the marine geosciences and will be supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and several international partners.  IODP builds on a rich legacy of scientific ocean drilling pioneered by NSF in the 1960's with the Deep Sea Drilling Project, which provided a test of the plate tectonic hypothesis and a basic reconnaissance of deep sea sediments and crustal rocks.   This was followed in 1985 by the Ocean Drilling Program, which focused on examination of Earth, ocean and climate processes. The current Integrated Ocean Drilling Program commenced in 2003 and has served as an expanded program of scientific ocean drilling based on &quot;Earth, Oceans and Life: Scientific Investigations of the Earth System Using Multiple Drilling Platforms and new Technologies; Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Initial Science Plan, 2003 - 2013&quot; (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.iodp.org/initial-science-plan">http://www.iodp.org/initial-science-plan</a> ).  IODP, expected to commence October 1, 2013 with the science plan available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/">http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/</a>, builds upon lessons learned in the previous programs to build a multi-platform international program based on cooperation rather than integration. IODP planning for <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> operations will be conducted under a Facilities Governing Board rather than an integrated Science Advisory Structure, and management and funding for JOIDES Resolution operations will occur independently of the other IODP drilling platforms. The Facilities Governing Board (FGB) will be made up of scientists and governmental representatives of nations contributing to <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> operations, as well as representatives of the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> science operator. The Facilities Governing Board will be advised by a Proposal Evaluation Panel (PEP), a Site Characterization Panel (SCP), and an Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP), and will be further served by a Site Survey Databank (SSDB). The FGB and its advisory panels will be utilized for proposal review by other science operators in IODP. The IODP Science Support Office will provide logistical support for the Facilities Governing Board and its advisory panels, manage and archive IODP Proposals and oversee their external review, and manage the SSDB.</p>
            <p>This solicitation seeks the services of a qualified organization to provide the IODP Science Support Office. The award, to be administered as a Cooperative Agreement, is intended to cover an initial five year period beginning on October 1, 2013.  A Program Review will be held prior to completion of the initial period and the results will guide a decision to re-compete or renew the Cooperative Agreement for a second five year period.</p>

        <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>Scientific ocean drilling is an important capability in modern geoscience research and education. Its broad use as a scientific tool ranges from investigating the causes of change in the Earth's climate to the rifting and drifting of continents. Drilling is the primary method of sampling sediment and crustal rock from the large percentage of the Earth's surface covered by oceans, and is the only technique for sampling anything more than a few tens of meters below the ocean floor.</p>
          <p>The Deep Sea Drilling Project, which began in 1968 under NSF sponsorship served as a test of the plate tectonic hypothesis and a basic reconnaissance of deep-sea sediments and crustal rocks. In 1974, the Deep Sea Drilling Project became an international program, with several European nations, Japan and the USSR entering into an agreement with NSF for providing scientific and financial participation.</p>
          <p>The Deep Sea Drilling Project was followed in 1985 by the Ocean Drilling Program, which was a focused examination of earth, ocean and climate processes. International participation in planning, research and funding of operations grew from an initial five countries in the Deep Sea Drilling Project to over 20 nations.</p>
          <p>For both the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean Drilling Program, NSF provided the primary facility by contracting and converting an industry drill ship for scientific drilling - the <em>Glomar Challenger</em> for the former, and the JOIDES Resolution for the latter. Both vessels served as facilities to carry out investigations proposed by the scientific community over the course of each program. The Ocean Drilling Program was structured in such a way that formal agreements between NSF and international partners terminated at the end of 2003 and were subsequently replaced and augmented by agreements for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.  </p>
          <p>Over the preceding decade, the NSF has participated in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, designed to address scientific objectives described in the Initial Science Plan (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.iodp.org/isp">http://www.iodp.org/isp</a>).  Among these are (1) Understanding the Deep Biosphere and Subsea floor Ocean, (2) Environmental Change, and (3) Solid Earth Cycles and Geodynamics.  The United States and Japan serve as co-leads, with membership from 23 other countries. Japan constructed a heavy riser drillship for the IODP (<em>Drilling Vessel or D/V Chikyu</em>), the United States has contributed a leased, lighter vessel (<em>D/V JOIDES Resolution</em>), and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) has contributed Mission Specific Platforms for shallow water and Arctic drilling. This multi-platform program expanded on the single platform Ocean Drilling Program. NSF invested $115 million from the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account in FY 2005 - FY 2007 to refit and optimize the leased <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> for 21<sup>st</sup> century science. This refurbishment project provided the U.S. research community and its international partners with a unique, world-class facility for ocean discovery.</p>
          <p>The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program significantly expanded the scope of the predecessor programs. It is currently scheduled to conclude September 30, 2013.  The program has undergone major restructuring and simplification by its international partners.  To streamline program management and reduce costs, the international partners have come together to design a new management structure and business model that enhances the multi-platform capabilities and ambitious science goals. The three distinct platform types (<em>JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, </em>and Mission Specific Platforms) will be operated independently by the respective countries. </p>
          <p>The <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> will be operated by the United States in partnership with countries and other entities contributing funds for JOIDES Resolution operations. Much of this new management structure is already in place and full implementation will follow in the new International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), to be initiated October 1, 2014. </p>
          <p>The operation of the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> in support of IODP is currently approved by the National Science Board through FY 2014. A re-competition for a Cooperative Agreement (CA) to continue operations of the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> beyond FY 2014 is the subject of a separate solicitation.  Following this re-competition, and contingent upon 1) a well-reviewed, highly meritorious proposal; 2) the availability of funds from NSF and its international partners; and 3) the ability of OCE to maintain a balanced portfolio of investments in infrastructure and science, NSF would then seek approval from the National Science Board in December 2013 for a CA to continue support for operation of the JOIDES Resolution beyond FY 2014. </p>
          <p>The Science Plan for the period 2013-2023: <em>Illuminating Earth's Past, Present, and Future: The International Ocean Discovery Program Science Plan for 2013-2023</em> (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/">http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/</a>) provides justification for United States' participation in the IODP and reflects the top priorities of the international science community. Top priorities of the U.S. science community are outlined in a report from a workshop that took place from April 30 - May 2, 2012 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://iodp-usssp.org/wp-content/uploads/Workshop_BuildingUSStrategies_Report.pdf">http://iodp-usssp.org/wp-content/uploads/Workshop_BuildingUSStrategies_Report.pdf</a> ). These priorities include borehole observatories to study fundamental aspects of the deep biosphere, high resolution studies of past climate at high latitudes, studies of collisional plate boundaries such as Cascadia that periodically generate giant earthquakes and tsunamis, and the commitment to operate the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> more efficiently through setting regional ship tracks in advance.</p>
          <p>The scientific accomplishments and the potential for future scientific discoveries envisioned in the new science plan were reviewed in the National Research Council report <em>Scientific Ocean Drilling: Accomplishments and Challenges (2011)</em> (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13232#toc">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13232#toc</a> ). The NRC review was favorable concerning both scientific progress and management of scientific ocean drilling, and recommended continuation for another decade with the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> playing a key operational role. Nevertheless, a recent, separately commissioned review by a subcommittee of the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences accepted the NRC findings, but recommended that approval by NSF to move forward with IODP be predicated upon a cost-effective and affordable <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> facility business plan and a consequently acceptable Division of Ocean Sciences balance between infrastructure cost and science support.</p>
          <p>As of April 2012, there were 54 highly rated <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> drilling proposals held within the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Advisory Structure that address the new science plan.  They will be carried over into IODP and will be joined by additional proposals that are being actively solicited and submitted.  In the modified management structure, long term planning of <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> drilling operations will be done by a Facility Governing Board, which will include all partners contributing to <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> operations, members of the international science community, and the vessel's science operator.</p>
          <p>This Solicitation seeks to select a highly qualified organization to serve as the Support Office to support science planning in IODP between FY2014 and FY2019.  Pending the outcome of a program review and the availability of funds, this cooperative agreement may be re-competed for renewed for an additional five years through 2023. This Support Office, funded through contributions to the U.S. Facility Governing Board to support <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> operations, is intended to have the following tasks: support of the Facility Governing Board Advisory Panels and associated meeting logistical support, manage and archive IODP Proposals and oversee their external review, oversight of the Site Survey Data Bank (SSDB), and maintenance of the IODP support website.  The Support Office will handle drilling proposals for the <em>JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, and </em>MSPs and may be utilized upon request by other platform providers.</p>
        
        <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences (NSF-OCE) intends to provide robust and cost effective support of IODP Science Support Office services within available resources. Work will be performed over the life of the program in accordance with the prospective Cooperative Agreement and each fiscal year's approved Annual Program Plan (APP).  Annual Program Plans will include a detailed budget for each task element described below, itemized by expected costs of salaries and fringe benefits, travel, supplies, shipping, communication, other contractual services, equipment, other direct costs, etc.</p>
          <p>The Awardee will ensure that planning, execution, and reporting of the IODP Science Support Office integrates the requirements of NSF with the needs of the national and international scientific community.  Proposals should clearly show lines of authority, responsibility and communication between NSF, the Awardee and partners, and include a discussion of management procedures for selecting, monitoring, and controlling subcontracted and subawarded efforts to meet the scientific and technical objectives of the IODP.  Detailed Quarterly and Annual Reports are required to summarize actual Awardee results with respect to the Annual Program Plan. The Awardee will participate in annual program reviews by panels of experts convened by NSF who will review Awardee performance and management under the Cooperative Agreement. The Awardee will also participate in NSF Management and Business System Reviews, typically conducted once every five years.  </p>
          <p>Principal Support Office tasks are given below:</p>
          <p><strong>1.  Logistical Support for the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> Facilities Governing Board</strong><strong> and its Advisory Panels</strong></p>
          <p>The Awardee will establish and maintain an organizational structure and staff capable of logistically supporting the meetings of the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> Facilities Governing Board and its Advisory Panels, including assisting in planning, selection, approval, and management of meeting location and facilities in conjunction with the local host, and providing assistance in the creation of meeting minutes as needed. Terms of Reference for the Advisory Panels will be provided by the Facilities Governing Board. The Advisory Panel representatives will be staffed by IODP Program Member Offices using a to-be-determined quota system based primarily upon national/consortia contributions to the operations of the <em>JOIDES Resolution,</em> but with programmatic contributions and scientific needs also taken into consideration. Advisory Panel meetings may be physical or virtual, depending upon need at the time. These Advisory Panels include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proposal Evaluation Panel (PEP): the key scientific panel that integrates the program and ensures scientific excellence in accordance with the Science Plan of IODP.  Although created to serve the review needs of proposals that would utilize the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em>, the PEP will be also be used to review proposals for all IODP drilling platforms. <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> and Mission-Specific Platform (MSP) proposals will be received and evaluated by the PEP twice per year. Chikyu proposals will be received by PEP in response to specific proposal calls issued by the Science Support Office in response to FGB direction. The PEP is divided into four thematic breakout groups (Climate and Ocean Change, Biosphere Frontiers, Earth Connections, and Earth in Motion, reflecting the four broad themes of the IODP Science Plan). An ad hoc PEP breakout group, distinct from the four thematic breakout groups (with additional scientific and operational expertise supplied to PEP as required), will meet for evaluation of Chikyu and other complex proposals. </li>
            <li>Site Characterization Panel (SCP): the science panel ensuring that proposed drilling sites have adequate characterization in order to achieve their science objectives. The SCP works closely with the PEP; both are expected to meet jointly at a common location. </li>
            <li>Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP): the panel ensuring that science operations may proceed in a safe manner, mitigating any potential harm to the environment. Panel membership will be determined in consultation with NSF and the Facility Governing Board.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2.  Oversight of the Proposal Review Process</strong></p>
          <p> The Awardee will receive and archive proposals and their reviews for all platforms in a remotely-accessible database.  Proposals will be forwarded to the Science Advisory Panels and Facility Governing Boards for review of science and logistical support requirements. As part of the logistical support for PEP, the Awardee will facilitate the obtaining of independent, external 3<sup>rd</sup> party proposal peer review.</p>
          <p> <strong>3. Management of the Site Survey Databank</strong></p>
          <p>The Awardee will be assigned responsibility for oversight of the existing IODP Site Survey Data Bank (SSDB), currently managed by The Regents of the University of California, San Diego Campus under IODP Management International (IODP-MI) Subcontract # IODP-MI-05-04. The SSDB provides support for data characterizing proposed drilling sites in IODP, and supports the work of the Site Characterization Panel. The Awardee will be responsible for entering into a new Subaward agreement with The Regents of the University of California, San Diego Campus for provision of SSDB services.  Copies of the SSDB Subcontract # IODP-MI-05-04 and the SSDB Statement of Work are available electronically from the cognizant NSF Program Officer.</p>
          <p><strong>4.  Supporting Website</strong></p>
          <p>The Awardee will provide a website that acts as a &quot;gateway&quot; to IODP scientific planning, with links to all major IODP entities. The website will further serve as a gateway for submitting IODP proposals, providing access to proposal summaries to the general public.  The website will fully comply with Federal and NSF guidelines.</p>
          <p><strong>Proposal Deliverables  </strong></p>
          <p>Responses to each proposal deliverable given below will be weighted equally in review of submitted proposals.</p>
          <p>1. Proposals should clearly present the management structure, capability, experience and qualifications of the Organization(s) necessary to carry out the program.  Explain the roles and responsibilities of each known or planned team entity (including Key Personnel), the basis for its inclusion, and how it best contributes to accomplishing IODP objectives.  </p>
          <p>2.  Proposals should thoroughly describe the approach intended to perform each described task. Discuss any special qualifications or relevant organizational experience. </p>
          <p>3. Discuss for each task how success will be assured relative to applicable measures of performance, including Quality of Product/Services, Cost Control, Timeliness, Business Relations and consistent completion of activities defined by Annual Program Plans within budget and schedule.   </p>
          <p>4. Provide estimated costs for each year for the five year performance period.  Explain the benefits of the proposed approach, how it will make efficient use of material and personnel resources, and how costs will be controlled.  In developing their resources and estimates, proposers shall be mindful that the cooperative agreement may be re-competed or renewed for another five year period depending on the outcome of a program review and the availability of funds.</p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
            </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
            </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
            </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>Review criteria will also include the following, assigned to the Proposal Deliverables described in Section II as noted below:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Assessment of the proponent organization's structure, competence, overall ability, and past history in providing service and support to the community of Earth and Ocean Sciences (Deliverable #1). </li>
          <li>Thoroughness of the proposal in addressing the relevant elements of IODP programmatic management included in the Program Description section of the solicitation (Deliverable #2).</li>
          <li>Effectiveness of the proposal in conveying an understanding of the required effort and the approach used to achieve an appropriate balance of resource allocation (Deliverables #3 and 4).</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        
      
        <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Internal NSF Review, or Site Visit Review. </p>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by a Panel of external members of the scientific community and by Internal NSF Review. Ad hoc Review and Site Visit Review may also occur, to be decided upon by the Program Officer in consultation with the Marine Geosciences Section Head and the OCE Division Director. </p>
  <a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
        <h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and contributions.  PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system.  Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Reporting Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>The NSF will issue an annual written mission forecast of IODP goals and requirements for the IODP <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> Support Office.  Within 120 days thereafter, the Awardee will submit an Annual Program Plan that establishes the approach to fulfilling NSF goals and requirements and cost targets for expenditures.  The Program Plan will cover the upcoming operational year and will address, but not be limited to, Programmatic Goals, Metrics and Milestones, Field Activities, Staffing and Organization Plans, Project Budgets, Major Planning Activities, and Insurance.  Program Plan contents will reflect the schedules, funding levels, guidelines and formats approved by the NSF Program Officer, with detailed budgets for each Work Breakdown Structure Element.  The approved Program Plan will serve to guide IODP <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> Support Office operations for each respective year during the CA period of performance.  Significant changes, apparent to the Awardee or identified by the NSF Program Officer, in objectives or activities described in the annual Program Plan, must be approved by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer prior to implementation.  Included are changes involving a funding re-distribution in excess of an amount yet to be negotiated between NSF Program Officials and Awardee. The impacts and reasons for the proposed changes must be explained. The changes may or may not require modification of the approved budget. Awardee shall provide NSF Program Officials with copies of all significant revisions to documentation, upon request, substantiating all changes to the Program Plan, whether or not NSF approval is required. All significant changes shall be reported in the quarterly report.</p>
        <p>News releases and other similar items prepared by the Awardee and/or its subcontractors/employees that describe IODP activities or research results will be submitted for NSF review at least two days prior to publication and will acknowledge the sponsorship of the NSF and its international IODP partners.  Public information brochures, and other similar IODP-related material prepared by the Awardee will be sent to the NSF before being made available to the public.  The text of any planned Congressional testimony related to the IODP will be submitted to NSF for approval prior to its presentation.</p>
        <p>The Awardee will acknowledge the support of the NSF on any signs identifying the IODP at its various locations.  An acknowledgement of NSF support and disclaimer must appear in any publication of any material based upon or developed under this contract in substantially the following terms: </p>
        <p>&quot;The International Ocean Discovery Program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and other participating countries. Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.&quot;  (The preceding sentence may be omitted from scientific articles or papers published in scientific journals.)  Also, support of other agencies or international contributors shall be acknowledged as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Within a 2 year period following award of the CA, the Awardee may be required to participate in a Business Systems Review (BSR), which is intended to evaluate Awardee business practices against government requirements, as well as to provide guidance on best practices.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
