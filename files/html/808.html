      <p><strong>1.	Changes in the STC Program and Solicitation</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the new FY 2003 STC Program Solicitation
          differ from the previous FY 2000 STC Program Solicitation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf0067">NSF
          00-67</a>)?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The new STC Program Solicitation has been
          revised in several ways: the solicitation format has been revised to
          be consistent with current NSF-wide standards for program announcements;
          changes have been incorporated to streamline the solicitation, to reduce
          workload for the research and education community, and to improve proposal
          content for reviewers. Highlights of the changes include:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong> Question:</strong> What remains the same in the new STC Solicitation?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The objectives of the STC Program remain the same as in the
        previous solicitation. Most of the changes to this new solicitation are
        intended to clarify NSF's intent, and to streamline and improve the review
        process, based on experience with the previous competitions. Several
        main features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Pending availability of funds, $30 million to be available
        to make between 6-8 awards;</li>
        <li>Cost sharing required is 30% of the amount
        provided by NSF, no more, no less;</li>
        <li>Limits the number of preliminary
        proposals allowed by a lead institution to five;</li>
        <li>Requires submission
          of comprehensive lists of personnel, institutions, and collaborators
        involved for determining conflicts of interest;</li>
        <li>Provides deadline dates
        for preliminary proposals and full proposals;</li>
        <li>Preliminary and full
        proposals to be submitted via FastLane;</li>
        <li>Full proposals by invitation
          only.</li>
      </ul>      <p><strong>2. Research areas appropriate for STCs</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What research areas are appropriate for STC preliminary proposals
          and full proposals?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> NSF will entertain STC preliminary proposals and full proposals
          in all areas of research and education normally supported by the Foundation.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong>	What research areas are covered by the existing STCs?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This information and more about the existing STCs can be found
          at the following URL:<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/ita.htm"> https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/ita.htm</a></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>        3. Education Plan</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <strong>Question:</strong> How involved should our Center be in education? </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> NSF expects each Center to make the education of American students
          a high priority and to apply the same scholarly mind-set to education
          as to research. A Center is expected to understand the challenges facing
          education in its areas of research, and the contributions that the Center
          has the potential to make to address those challenges. The contributions
          desired by the Center then drive the design of specific educational activities
          and their evaluation.</p>
        <p>          <strong>Question:</strong> Must each Center have K-12 activities? The past solicitation
              made mention of K-12, but we don&#8217;t see it in this solicitation. </p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> No, there is no requirement for K-12 activities. Each Center
          should undertake activities at the level of education that serve the
          Center research and education goals. These may involve any level from
          precollege through adult education.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>        4. Eligibility</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> May a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) submit a proposal to this program
          that contains at least one or two U.S. academic institutions with significant
          research and degree-granting education programs as well as national laboratories
          and state and local government laboratories? </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. The lead institution submitting an STC preliminary or full
          proposal must be a U.S. academic institution with significant research
          and degree-granting education programs in any area of science and engineering
          normally supported by NSF. A not-for-profit 501(c)(3) can be a partner
          with the lead institution that submits the STC preliminary or full proposal,
        but cannot be the lead institution itself.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>5.	Number of preliminary proposals</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question: </strong>Please clarify the statement within your Science and Technology
          Centers: Integrative Partnerships Program Solicitation that states: &quot;A
          single institution may submit no more than five preliminary proposals
          as lead institution, and may be involved as a partner in additional preliminary
          proposals submitted by other institutions.&quot; How do the proposals
          on which we collaborate but are not the lead count against the five?
          The way this is written it appears we can have five as lead and an
          unlimited number on which we merely participate but not as lead.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>You are correct in your interpretation of the language in the
          STC Program Solicitation. Your institution may submit as many as five
          preliminary proposals as lead and may, in addition, be a participant
          on an unlimited number of preliminary proposals that are submitted by
          lead institutions other than your own. The preliminary proposals on which
          you collaborate but do not lead are not counted against the five you
        submit as lead institution.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>6.	Cost sharing</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong>	Could you please clarify the language
          regarding the cost sharing requirements?</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>The STC Program Solicitation states that &#8220;For eligibility
          purposes, cost sharing at a level of 30% of the requested total amount
          of NSF funds is required for all preliminary proposals and full proposals
          submitted in response to this solicitation.&#8221; This means that
          cost sharing shown on submissions should be no less than 30% and no
          more than
          30%. The 30% level required by NSF is an eligibility criterion rather
          than a review criterion. Thus, for the STC Program Solicitation, any
          proposal with cost sharing less than 30% or in excess of 30% will be
          ineligible and will be returned without review. This requirement assures
          that the level of cost sharing will be equivalent for all preliminary
          proposals and full proposals submitted to the STC competition. </p>
        <p>In addition, &quot;Cost sharing will be required at a level of 30% of
          the total amount provided by NSF for any STC funded by NSF&quot;. This
          indicates that once NSF reviews the proposal, if the budget amount
          NSF provides varies from the amount requested, the level of cost sharing
          required will remain at 30% of the amount that NSF ultimately provides.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the entire 30% required to be from the lead institution
          or can it come from other sources?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 30% can come from any number of non-Federal sources but
          the lead institution has to certify that the amount is available and
          the lead institution is ultimately responsible for the cost sharing should
          a partner institution default on it's cost sharing. </p>
        <p> It is anticipated that most STCs will have cost sharing from a variety
          of sources or partners. Please note that, as defined in the STC Program
          Solicitation, &quot;A partner is an institution or organization that
          invests intellectual resources in the Center, <strong>backed by financial
          commitment to the Center.</strong> The partner institutions work together with NSF to ensure
          vital participation in an integrative effort in the research education,
          and knowledge transfer activities of the Center.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is a level of 30% cost sharing required for each institution
          participating in the STC?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. The lead institution of the proposed STC is responsible
          for the full cost sharing but may demonstrate cost sharing at a level
          of 30% with the participating institutions. Each partner may have different
          levels of cost sharing (each is to be provided on line M of the subawardees
          budget page). This allows a given Center to come up with the 30% cost
          share in any way it deems most appropriate. For example, an STC comprising
          two institutions, each requesting the same amount of support from NSF,
          might have one cost share at a level of 40% and the other cost share
          at a level of 20%, for an overall cost sharing level of 30% for the Center
          as a whole. The key is that the overall Center cost share must be 30%,
          but NSF gives the Center the flexibility to determine how to arrive at
          this level when it decides upon the appropriate cost sharing for its
          participating members. </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Letters of commitment are not allowed. Can we submit a letter
          of commitment?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. Letters of commitment are not permitted and may not be included
          with the preliminary or full proposal. </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Must cost sharing included in the preliminary proposal cover
          the ten-year period of support?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. The preliminary proposal budget should include cost sharing
          for the first five years of the proposed Center only. The full proposal
          should also include cost sharing for the first five-year period of support.
          The second five-year period of cost sharing will not be required until
          a renewal proposal is submitted.</p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><strong>        7. Budgets for Preliminary Proposal and Full Proposal</strong>        
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>      <strong>Question: </strong>The solicitation requests a budget for the five-year period
          only. Should we submit a budget for each year in the preliminary proposal? </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. You should only provide a total budget for the full five-year
            period. In FastLane, enter the total 5-year budget in &quot;Budget year
            1&quot;. A detailed budget for each year and budgets for subawardees/subcontractors
            should not be submitted in the preliminary proposal. However, you should
            briefly describe in your budget justification how funds will be allocated
            for each year to the research, education, and knowledge transfer areas,
            for each participant, and indicate your plans for the start-up phase
            of the Center. You should also indicate large, costly items, such as
          major equipment, that will be needed. </p>
        <p><strong>Question: </strong>Should we submit a budget for each subawardee or participating
          institution in the preliminary proposal or the full proposal?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Not in the preliminary proposal. NSF needs only the total budget
            for the preliminary proposal. For the full proposal, a budget for each
            subwardee is needed. The lead institution budget should show total amounts;
            the sum of all the subawardee budgets should add up to the amount shown
          on the lead institution budget page for subawardees.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>8. STC Directors&#8212;citizenship and eligibility:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are permanent residents eligible to be prospective STC directors,
          or are only U.S. citizens to be considered?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> As long as the investigator is engaged in science and technology
          research and education at a U.S. institution, he or she is eligible.
          For the STC Program, permanent residents are eligible to be prospective
          STC directors and applicants are not limited to U.S. citizens. </p>
      </blockquote>      <p> <strong>       9.	Notice of intent</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Does NSF require letters of intent for this competition as
          it did in the last competition?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. Letters of intent are not required, and should not be submitted.</p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>          <strong>10. Lists of Institutions and Project Personnel&#8212;page
          limit</strong>          </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>        <strong>Question:</strong> In the last solicitation, there were page limits set for the
            lists of project personnel and institutions. Are there page limits for
          this new solicitation?</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> No. In short, accuracy is much more important to us than
            the page limit&#8212;both for the list of participants and list of
            collaborators/conflicts. Please use as many pages as needed for full
            and accurate lists. However,
            the lists should include no material other than that asked for in the
            Program Solicitation. The font size should be the same throughout the
            proposal. Please be advised that page limits as indicated for other
          sections of the proposal will be strictly enforced.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p>        <strong>11. Lists of Institutions, Project Personnel, and Collaborators&#8212;Conflicts
        of Interest</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> The STC Program Solicitation asks for lists of institutions,
          project personnel, and collaborators with Conflicts of Interest. What
          constitutes a Conflict of Interest?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>In addition to lists of institutions and project personnel,
          the STC Program Solicitation requires that Principal Investigators provide,
          to the best of their ability, a list of all collaborators, participants
          and affiliates, to aid NSF in identifying reviewers who may have potential
          conflicts of interest with any of the project's personnel (PI, co-PI,
          and other personnel). </p>
        <p>To assist you in knowing what constitutes a Conflict of Interest, be
          advised that when your preliminary proposal or full proposal is reviewed
          by the National Science Foundation, reviewers will be asked to disclose
          as potential conflicts of interest any of their affiliations and relationships
          in the areas listed below. </p>
        <p>We realize that a PI cannot be expected to know all the details of
          conflicts of interest for the entire potential reviewing community.
          Therefore,
          for purposes of the STC collaborators list, please concentrate your
          efforts on providing us with information for those collaborators whose
          Conflicts
          of Interest can be found under the first major grouping below, namely, &quot;Personal
          Relationship with an Investigator, Project Director, or Other Person

        <p><strong>Question: </strong>After we submit the preliminary or full proposal, are we to
          update this information in FastLane? </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. Once the preliminary (or full) proposal is submitted,
                any changes in the participating institutions, personnel, collaborators,
              subcontractors, or other affiliates can&#8217;t be made to the
              proposal (preliminary or full). However, it is important to notify
              NSF of changes
              as they occur, for the purpose of identifying potential conflicts
              of interest during the review process. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Should we notify NSF of changes in personnel or participating
            institutions? When should we notify NSF? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Updated information should be sent by the lead institution
            to <a href="mailto:stc@nsf.gov">stc@nsf.gov</a> as soon as it is available. Updated completed information
            will be requested prior to a site visit. </p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>12.	Required Supplementary Documents information for Single Copy Documents.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> The preliminary proposal requires a list of Partner Institutions
          and a List of Project Personnel to be submitted as part of the Supplementary
          Documents required. Is this the same information that is required for
          the Single Copy documents? Why do we enter this in two places?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. The lists of Partner Institutions and Project Personnel
          are required as supplementary documents for both preliminary and full
          proposals. Supplementary Documents in FastLane are PDF files, and can't
          be used to create the database needed by staff, therefore the information
          must be entered into the two different locations in FastLane.</p>
        <p>This information is needed as part of the proposal for reviewers and
          NSF staff. Entering this information in the Supplementary Documents
          section ensures it will be accessible to reviewers as part of the proposal.
          It
          is recommended that you enter the Non Co-PI Senior Personnel information
          in the Single Copy Document section &#8220;List of Personnel, Collaborators
          and Affiliates&#8221; first, and then enter information in the Supplementary
          Documents section. </p>
        <p>Single Copy Documents do not become part of the proposal and are not
          seen by reviewers. The information you provide, as a Single Copy Document
          becomes part of a database used by NSF staff. </p>
        <p>The &quot;List of Collaborators/Individuals with Conflicts of Interest&quot;,
          must be entered as a Single Copy Document and is critical for the NSF
          review of your proposal. It is important that the information for these
          lists is complete and accurate, and in the correct format. Follow instructions
          provided in FastLane and the solicitation.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the information for the Supplementary Documents and the
          Single Copy Documents optional?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. Complete and accurate information is required for both the
          preliminary and full proposals submitted to this competition. </p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>        13. Federal Government laboratory partnerships</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> I am interested in preparing a preliminary proposal for the
          new STC Program Solicitation. The Program Solicitation mentions collaborations
          and partnerships with National Laboratories. Can you tell me what limitations
          apply to these collaborations regarding funding resources? In particular,
          is it possible to provide money directly to lab personnel for salary,
          travel, and hiring of students and post-docs?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The STC Program encourages partnerships with Federal Government
          laboratories, including the National Laboratories operated by the Department
          of Energy. However, NSF does not typically reimburse costs that are covered
          by another agency's appropriations. NSF funding of federal employees
          such as lab personnel is generally not appropriate (see NSF Grant Policy
          Manual 616.3).</p>
      </blockquote>      <p><strong>        14.	International collaboration</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does NSF view international collaboration?</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> Centers are encouraged to engage in cooperative activities
            with foreign scientists and organizations whenever it will benefit
            science
            or engineering and not harm United States competitiveness. Before
          a Center engages in any cooperative international activities, the Center
            Director
            must notify the cognizant NSF Program Officer for review and approval.
            Each Center must include information about its international activities
            in it&#8217;s annual report; and must use its best efforts to ensure
            that any collaboration between the Center and a foreign individual
            or organization will be conducted on a comparable access basis.</p>
        <p><strong> Question: </strong>As we are developing our preliminary proposal for an STC, we
            had a question concerning international participation. We would like
            to know if it is acceptable to include international industries as
            well as academics in the STCs.</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> There is no problem with either academic or industrial international
          collaboration as long as it can be justified as an integral part of the
          proposed Center's activities. Many of the currently supported STCs include
          both types of international collaboration. However, the foreign partners,
          not NSF, must provide funding for international academic or industrial
          collaborators.        </p>
        <p>        <strong>Question:</strong> Can a foreign institution, as a partner or subcontractor, be
          financed with funds from an STC award?        </p>
        <p>        <strong>Answer:</strong> NSF does not expect to fund foreign institutions as partners
          or subcontractors. Extraordinary circumstances may be considered on a
          case-by-case basis, such as activities that require access to unique
          foreign facilities, unique foreign data resources not generally available
          to U.S. investigators (or which would require significant effort or time
          to duplicate), foreign geographic locations, or other foreign resources
          that are essential contributing factors to the success of the proposed
          project.        </p>
        <p>        <strong>Question:</strong> Graduate students working on our proposed STC will be supported
          as research assistants. I assume that these positions would be open to
          any qualified student, foreign or U.S. that we admit to our graduate
          programs, as is the case with an NSF grant. If there are restrictions
          on appointing research assistants we would like to be made aware of them.</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>One of the goals of the STC Program is to increase the numbers
          of educated U.S. citizens by increasing the numbers of U.S. undergraduate
          students, graduate students and post-docs engaged in science and engineering.
          The STC Program Solicitation does not specifically rule out research
          assistantships to foreign students. However, if a proposed Center is
          to meet the goals of the STC program for educating U.S. citizens, then
          the proposed Center should plan for U.S. citizens (undergraduates and
          graduates) to be the principal, if not exclusive, recipients of educational
          aid and research assistant appointments. It would be difficult to see
          how a proposed Center's educational component could be acceptable if
          it did not include a large preponderance of U.S. citizens as beneficiaries. </p>
        <p> <strong>Question:</strong>	Our proposed Center does not include a &quot;fellowship program&quot; as
          such. However, we would like to propose paying for &quot;three-month
          living stipends&quot; for students from collaborating institutions
          in foreign countries to visit members of the Center for cooperative
          research
          and training. If there are any restrictions on this, please advise.</p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> In general, the country sending the students is expected to
          pay for their travel to and expenses in the receiving country. There
          are exceptions for students from countries whose currency is not convertible.
          The STC Program rarely supports activities to bring foreign students
          to the U.S. since one of the goals of the Program is to educate U.S.
          citizens as students and post-docs engaged in science. Extraordinary
          cases may be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p> <strong>Question:</strong> Is it acceptable for a foreign laboratory to allocate and
          pay for a foreign post-graduate fellowship for our proposed STC? </p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> There is no problem with a foreign laboratory's paying for
          foreign post-graduate fellowships at an STC.</p>
      </blockquote>      <p>        <strong>15.	Next STC competition:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> After the current STC competition is completed, when will
          the next STC competition begin?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pending availability of funds, the next STC competition is expected
          to start three years from the start of this competition. The Program
          Solicitation for the current competition is expected serve as the Program
          Solicitation for the next competition, subject to change. The deadline
          dates and review schedule for the next competition, although not yet
          determined, should be similar to those for the currently announced competition.
          The STC web site will be updated with information regarding the next
          competition when deadline dates for preliminary proposals and full proposals
          are better known.</p>
