<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>For over thirty years, the CRIF Program has provided support to research institutions for the establishment of regional or national instrumentation facilities, the purchase of departmental research instrumentation, and the development of state-of-the-art equipment. Due to the different nature of these requests, the Division of Chemistry has separated the components of this infrastructure program into three stand-alone competitions: (a) the CRIF: Department Multiuser Instrumentation Program, or CRIF:MU (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf05578">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf05578</a>); (b) the CRIF: Instrument Development Program, or CRIF:ID (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04534">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04534</a>); and (c) the CRIF: Cyberinfrastructure and Research Facilities Program, or CRIF:CRF (this solicitation). CRIF:CRF will provide funds to research organizations and consortia of research organizations to build a foundation for cyber-enabled chemical research and education; and to establish and support multi-user research facilities with unique capabilities in the chemical sciences. This program is structured to enable NSF, through its Division of Chemistry, to respond to a variety of needs for infrastructure to support basic research and education in chemistry. Under this program, investigators may seek funding to establish and support either centers for the development of cyber-enabled chemical research, or regional or national instrumentation facilities.&nbsp; Preference will be given to cyber-enabled chemistry proposals that are distinct from the projects represented by the FY05 and FY06 awards (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535542">CHE-0535542</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535640">CHE-0535640</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535656">CHE-0535656</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535710">CHE-0535710</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0625419">CHE-0625419</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626111">CHE-0626111</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626305">CHE-0626305</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626354">CHE-0626354</a>).</p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Research facilities are meant to serve as unique resources that enable access to state-of-the-art instrumentation that is too expensive or specialized for an individual faculty member or typical departmental multi-user facility. A research facility is distinctly different from a departmental instrument center, in that it provides for unique or nearly unique instrumentation or other resources that are too expensive to be widely available or must be custom-made or developed. A research facility typically requires a permanent staff to operate and maintain instrumentation and to provide service to a national or regional user community. It is anticipated that there will be only a few facilities and that there will not be more than one facility in a given technical area. These facilities are expected to serve the state-of-the-art instrumentation needs for a wide community of users and simultaneously to support core research in the development of next-generation instrumentation and instrumental methods. Instrumentation in this context is to be construed in a broad sense to include physical equipment, computational capabilities, and software. Research facilities are also encouraged to exploit or develop cyberinfrastructure (see below) in order to maximize accessibility of the instrumentation and other resources.</p>
  <p>Specialized equipment and software dedicated for use in particular chemistry research projects are normally funded as part of individual investigator awards, along with personnel and other direct project costs. Major instruments and computing environments shared and maintained for multiple uses by researchers in a department may be funded through the CRIF:MU and Major Research Instrumentation programs (see Section IX). In contrast, CRIF:CRF supports large single instruments or collections of instruments that are unique because of their capabilities and/or because they represent new models for the operation of facilities that provide extraordinary research opportunities.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
  <li><strong> Cyberinfrastructure</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>As described in the report, &ldquo;Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through Cyberinfrastructure: Report of the NSF Blue-Ribbon Advisory Panel on Cyberinfrastructure,&rdquo; the
    manner in which scientific and engineering research and education is conducted
    will be radically transformed by cyberinfrastructure. This report may be
    accessed at <a href="http://www.cise.nsf.gov/sci/reports/atkins.pdf">http://www.cise.nsf.gov/sci/reports/atkins.pdf</a>. The NSF Division of Chemistry shares this vision and has held a workshop that has identified research and education frontiers that would be enabled by investments in cyberinfrastructure. The report from this workshop may be accessed at <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/faculty/cyber_workshop/">http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/faculty/cyber_workshop/</a>, and general information about cyber-enabled chemistry may be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13603&amp;org=CHE&amp;from=home">www.nsf.gov/chem/cyber</a>.
    A National Research Council report, &ldquo;Information and Communications,&rdquo; also
    identifies opportunities in cyberinfrastructure in the chemical sciences
    and is available at <a href="http://books.nap.edu/catalog/10831.html">http://books.nap.edu/catalog/10831.html</a>.</p>
  <p>Cyberinfrastructure is enabling new chemical research and education activities
    through grid computing, community databases, remote access to instrumentation,
    electronic support for geographically dispersed collaborations, and other
    web- and grid-accessible services. A team of researchers in a virtual laboratory
    can now assemble distributed expertise and resources to target chemical research
    and educational priorities. Advances in cyberinfrastructure in areas such
    as scientific portals, workflow management, computational modeling, and data
    and molecular visualization will clearly impact the day-to-day practice of
    chemistry in the near future. Moreover, the access to expertise and resources
    that cyberinfrastructure provides holds the potential to broaden participation
    in the chemical sciences to create a truly inclusive national and international
    community. To achieve this vision, certain characteristics of the chemistry
    research community &ndash; specifically, the broad range of its computational techniques and data types and its large number of independent data producers &ndash; pose unique challenges that will need to be overcome. Close interaction between practicing chemists and information technology developers, iterative approaches to software development and deployment, and mechanisms to share best practices will all be critical in advancing a cyber-enabled chemistry community. It should be noted that specialized software dedicated to an individual investigator&rsquo;s
    research project would not be supported through the CRIF:CRF program, as
    it is normally supported as part of an individual investigator award.</p>
  <p>For FY07, preference will be given to cyber-enabled chemistry proposals that are distinct from the projects represented by the FY05 and FY06 awards (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535542">CHE-0535542</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535640">CHE-0535640</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535656">CHE-0535656</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535710">CHE-0535710</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0625419">CHE-0625419</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626111">CHE-0626111</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626305">CHE-0626305</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626354">CHE-0626354</a>). Note also that all proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are subject to program-specific review criteria (see Section VI. A) in addition to the standard NSF criteria on intellectual merit and broader impacts.</p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The CRIF:CRF Program accepts proposals for the support of cyberinfrastructure projects and for national or regional facilities that would provide unique computational and/or state-of-the-art instrumentation capabilities for research to a broad community of chemical scientists.</p>
<p>Examples of cyberinfrastructure projects might include developing freely distributed computational codes that take advantage of grid technologies; networking of analytical instrumentation to provide remote access for educational/home/commercial use; and establishing digital libraries and repositories for sharing of chemical data. Advances in areas such as scientific portals, workflow management, computational modeling, remote use of instrumentation, and data and molecular visualization provide other examples of the rich opportunities associated with the development of cyberinfrastructure.</p>
<p>A CRIF:CRF research facilities project provides for unique instrumentation capabilities that are either too expensive to be widely available or must be custom-made or developed. A CRIF:CRF research facilities project typically requires a permanent staff to operate and maintain instrumentation, and to provide service to a national or regional user community. Projects for the design and development stage of a large facility can also be considered under the CRIF:CRF program. PI&rsquo;s are strongly encouraged to consult with Division of Chemistry staff before submitting a cyberinfrastructure or research facilities proposal to CRIF:CRF.</p>
<p>CRIF:CRF projects are expected to serve the state-of-the-art software and/or instrumentation needs for a wide community of users and simultaneously to support core research in the development of cyberinfrastructure and/or next-generation instrumentation. The proposal should document these cyberinfrastructure and/or instrumentation needs and describe the research community the project would serve. For FY07, preference will be given to cyber-enabled chemistry proposals that are distinct from the projects represented by the FY05 and FY06 awards (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535542">CHE-0535542</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535640">CHE-0535640</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535656">CHE-0535656</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0535710">CHE-0535710</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0625419">CHE-0625419</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626111">CHE-0626111</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626305">CHE-0626305</a>; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0626354">CHE-0626354</a>).</p>
<p>Successful proposals will initially be supported by the Division of Chemistry
  of NSF for a period of up to five years, depending upon merit review through
  the CRIF:CRF program and the availability of funds. Annual progress reports
  will be required. On-site evaluations will be made during the award period.</p>

<p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
<p>Collaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system.&nbsp; Chapter II, Section D.3 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p><p>This solicitation contains information that supplements the standard
										  Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) proposal
										  preparation guidelines. Proposals for the support of cyberinfrastructure
										  or research facilities must include a full description of technical
										  capabilities and the impact that these projects will make on chemical
										  research and education. Investigators must identify the nature and
										  size of the user community in the chemical sciences that will make
										  principal use of the project&#146;s capabilities. </p>
		<p>Cyberinfrastructure and research facilities are intended, in part, to stimulate the development of new software environments and/or instrumentation capabilities; proposals must therefore include a description of the project in sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate its technical merit and its potential benefit to chemical research and education. Transfer of new knowledge or technology to various academic, industrial and government sectors is an important broader impact of CRIF:CRF projects, and partnerships involving these sectors as appropriate are encouraged. Plans for broad dissemination of the project&#146;s results will be considered in evaluation of the proposal.</p>
<p>CRIF:CRF instrumentation facilities proposals must include descriptions of the provisions for service operations, maintenance and development. Important elements include the management structure, qualifications of individuals in supervisory and support positions, external advisory structures, and partnerships. Requests for personnel support must include justification for each position and the responsibilities associated with the position. If a project will provide a service to users, the proposal should include a description of how user priority and user fees, if any, will be determined.</p>
<p>Detailed Proposal Format</p>
<p>NSF Cover and Certification Page. Enter this program solicitation number in the space indicated. Proposals should provide a title in the format: "CRIF:Facilities:..." or "CRIF:Cyber:..."</p>
<p>Form 1225 (Information about Principal Investigators/Project Directors) must be completed.</p>
<p>Project Summary (1 page maximum). The project summary should include the rationale for the project, the current and intended user community, the nature of the project, the areas of research and education to be enhanced, and the principal development goals. Both intellectual merit and broader impacts must be addressed in separate statements or the proposal will be returned without review.</p>
<p>Table of Contents. A table of contents will automatically be generated.</p>
<p>Project Description. This will be limited to 25 single-spaced pages. Within that overall page limitation, the proposal must address the following issues (a-g):</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>
    <p> Rationale for and Impact of the Project. This introductory section should
      describe (1) the need for the proposed cyberinfrastructure or research
      facility; (2) the unique capabilities and services it will bring to research
      and education in the chemical sciences; and (3) the community to be served,
      including the extent to which the project broadens participation in the
      chemical sciences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed Description. This section should provide a full
      description of the proposed project, including location, size, and major
      equipment to be purchased or constructed, software to be developed, services
      to be provided, and core research areas to be investigated. The plan should
      detail the instrument and/or software improvement and development component
      and explain how resources will be targeted at developing the next generation
      of research tools and techniques. Strategies to keep the proposed project
      at the forefront of research in the identified field must be described
      and necessary equipment upgrades planned and budgeted. Investigators should
      identify connections with other partners where appropriate, and the roles
      each will play in development. The proposal must contain a plan for evaluation
      of the feasibility of commercialization of the technical advances of the
      project in the case of instrumentation facilities, or dissemination of
      software in the case of cyberinfrastructure development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research Activities.
      This section should identify the senior on-site personnel supervising the
      project&#146;s research, development, and training;
      summarize their current research activities; and describe the research
      projects to be enhanced by the project. Numbers of additional personnel
      whose research and education would depend on the proposed project (e.g.,
      postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students, K-12 teachers
      and students, informal science education organizations, international partners)
      should be estimated as closely as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Service to the External Community.
      Because of the limited number of these projects, the PIs must demonstrate
      broad impact for a well-defined user community, and provide a plan for
      assessing performance and results of all activities supported by the project.&nbsp; For
      CRIF:CRF instrumentation facilities proposals, PIs must document the managerial,
      support personnel, advisory, and accounting structures necessary to fulfill
      the service objectives. For CRIF:CRF instrumentation facilities proposals,
      PIs must describe mechanisms for selecting proposals from users, for choosing
      among in-house activities, and for the allocation of resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Management
      Plan. For cyberinfrastructure projects, this section should describe a
      management plan including software maintenance, such as updates and archiving.
      For instrumentation facilities projects, this section should describe the
      management plan for direction, operation and maintenance of the proposed
      project.&nbsp; The management plan must identify the director
      and any senior personnel involved in the day-to-day operation of the project.
      The project must have an external advisory committee, selected in consultation
      with the NSF Division of Chemistry, to provide advice to the project management
      on operations, research directions and accessibility to the broader user
      community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education and Outreach. A CRIF:CRF project is a unique resource
      for education and training, for transfer of knowledge and technology, for
      exchanges of staff with other research organizations, and for outreach
      to communities currently underrepresented in science and engineering. Investigators
      should outline their plans to use the unique capabilities of the project
      to contribute to a stronger infrastructure in the chemical sciences through
      education and outreach activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results from Prior Support. All senior
      personnel must report on results from prior NSF support, up to a maximum
      of 5 pages in total.&nbsp; All renewal
      applications for continued funding of NSF Chemistry-supported facilities
      or center grants, whether supported by CRIF or other Chemistry programs,
      must provide Results from Prior Support. Information is required on major
      breakthroughs in research, software, or instrument development, publications,
      patents, past outreach activities and their impact, and sponsored workshops
      or meetings. Also, a combined alphabetized list of all scientists, with current
      affiliations, who have collaborated with the PI, co-PIs and other senior
      personnel in the last 48 months or are otherwise affiliated with them including
      Ph. D. and post-doctoral mentors and students, must be included in the Supplementary
      Documentation section (see below).&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Budget. This section should provide a detailed estimate and explanation of the total budget projected for establishment (or continuation) and operation of the cyberinfrastructure or research facility. Explain the basis for any cost estimates. Commitments of space, renovation, faculty, staff positions, or capital equipment should be detailed here, with estimated dollar values.</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches. Biographical sketches must be provided in the standard NSF format for the director, for all senior personnel whose core research activities would make major use of the facility/cyberinfrastructure project, and for any other senior personnel who would draw major salary support from the facility/cyberinfrastructure project.</p>
<p>Current and Pending Support. Current and pending support of two types must be summarized: (a) all current and pending support for the facility/cyberinfrastructure project, including any support from any source, received or pending, for support, repair, renovation, replacement, or construction of the proposed facilities in the previous five years; and (b) current and pending support (agency, award number, total award amount, expected duration, and topic) for all research projects of each senior investigator.</p>
<p>Supplementary Documentation. A combined alphabetized list of all scientists, with current affiliations, who have collaborated with the PI, co-PIs and other senior personnel in the last 48 months or are otherwise affiliated with them including Ph. D. and post-doctoral mentors and students, must be included in the Supplementary Documentation section.&nbsp;For Grants.gov users, supplementary documents should be attached in Field 11 of the R&R Other Project Information Form.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p id="reviewcrit" name="reviewcrit"><a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>    </p>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and,
  if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals
  are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an
  NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF
  who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These
  reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the
  review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe
  are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would
  prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in
  the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission
  of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers
  have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p id="reviewproc" name="reviewproc"><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>    </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    
    <strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
    within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the
    proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the
    reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does
    the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How
    well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient
    access to resources?  </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    
    <em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it
    supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide
    abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities
    as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts
    that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research
    through the diversity of learning perspectives.  </p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
    is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is
    committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
  <p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Qualifications of the
        project management to meet multiple purposes of research, education,
        and service simultaneously;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Capability of the project to provide a needed
        state-of-the-art resource for chemical research and education;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Breadth
        of the chemical sciences community that is impacted;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Anticipated effect
        on the development of instruments and/or software;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Effectiveness of partnerships
        for transferring of new knowledge and technology to appropriate academic,
        industrial, and government sectors;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use of unique project resources to
        enhance education and training of students; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Extent to which the project
        broadens participation in the chemical sciences.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>For renewal proposals, the following additional review criteria will be considered</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Quality
        of the scientific results obtained;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Continuing need for the project in
        terms of its impact on research and education in the chemical sciences;
        and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Workforce impact (for example, information on students trained and
        other professional development).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4><strong><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</strong></h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span class="input">Adhoc Review or Panel Review or Site Visit Review or Reverse Site Review</span>.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="input">Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review or Panel Review or Site Visit Review or Reverse Site Visit Review.</span></p>
    <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
    <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
    <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
    <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
    <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
    <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
    <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
    <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
    <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)
    <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
    <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
    <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.
    <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
    <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Grant Policy Manual</em> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm</a>.</p>
    <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
    <h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
    <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.
    <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
    <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

        <h3>IX. OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>The NSF Website provides the most comprehensive source of information
          on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding
          opportunities. Use of this Website by potential proposers is strongly
          encouraged. In addition, MyNSF (formerly the Custom News Service)is
          an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers
          and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities
          and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies
          and procedures, and upcoming NSF Regional Grants Conferences. Subscribers
          are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new
          publications are issued that match their identified interests. &nbsp;MyNSF
          also is available on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/mynsf/">https://www.nsf.gov/mynsf/</a>.
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this new mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov may be obtained at <a href="http://www.grants.gov">http://www.grants.gov</a>.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is
          solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act
          of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used
          in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project
          reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and
          reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information
          requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants
          as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees
          to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award
          decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors,
          experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete
          assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing
          information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application
          review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to
          another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative
          proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal
          Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select
          potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee
          members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69
          Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information
          is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however,
          may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.
