          <blockquote>
            <p>The NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) program within the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) is an umbrella for two complementary subprograms, Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) and Building Innovation Capacity (BIC). Both programs are concerned with the movement of academic research discoveries into the marketplace, although each focuses on different stages along the innovation spectrum. The PFI:AIR program has two additional subprograms: the PFI:AIR-Technology Translation (See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14569/nsf14569.htm">NSF 14-569,</a>) and PFI:AIR- Research Alliance (this solicitation). This PFI:AIR-Research Alliance (RA) solicitation is intended to accelerate the translation and transfer of existing research discoveries into competitive technologies and commercial realities by leveraging the investments NSF has made in research consortia (e.g., Engineering Research Centers, Industry University Cooperative Research Centers, Science and Technology Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, Centers for Chemical Innovation, and others) and catalyzing academic-based innovation ecosystems. The goal is that these synergistic partnerships and collaborations between government, academia, and other public and private entities will result in new wealth and the building of strong local and regional economies.</p>
            <p><strong>WEBINAR: A webinar will be held within 6 weeks of the release date of this solicitation to answer any questions about this solicitation. Details will be posted on the PFI:AIR-RA website </strong>(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/air-ra.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/air-ra.jsp</a>)<strong> as they become available</strong>.</p>

          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports fundamental research and education in science and engineering to advance basic knowledge and provide benefit to society. The preponderance of NSF-funded research supports the discovery that enables innovation. It lays the scientific and engineering knowledge base for technological innovation to prosper. In synergy with this, research supported by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) aims to systematically facilitate and accelerate the use of basic research results such that discovery is translated to innovation to realize its commercialization potential. IIP supports innovation research built on fundamental research discoveries that exhibit potential for societal and economic impact. In addition to the PFI:AIR-RA program (this solicitation), programs within IIP and NSF that contribute to this mission include: Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Translation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/air-tt.jsp">PFI:AIR-TT</a>), Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/bic.jsp">PFI:BIC</a>), Innovation Corps (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/">I-Corps</a>), the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Research (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/index.jsp?SBTR=SolicAS">SBIR/STTR</a>), and Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504699&amp;SBTR=SolicAG">GOALI</a>). For more information on these programs, please see the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships website: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?org=IIP">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?org=IIP</a>.</p>
        
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>The Directorate for Engineering (ENG) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) invites requests for funding under the Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Research Alliance (PFI:AIR-RA) solicitation. Through this solicitation, NSF seeks to accelerate the translation and transfer of existing research discoveries into competitive technologies and commercial realities, to promote the development of and/or the extension of an academic-based innovation ecosystem around an NSF-funded research consortium, and to enhance knowledge and practice of innovation in faculty and students.</p>
          <p>To accomplish these goals, the solicitation requires a partnership between an <a href="#con">NSF-funded consortium</a>, defined below, and two or more separate additional entities<em>. </em>Although two is the minimum requirement and may make sense for some proposals, NSF encourages the participation of multiple entities (three or more) in order to build the necessary relationships required to develop and sustain a viable innovation ecosystem.  At least one of the entities must be a third party investor and at least one must be a research partner. &ldquo;<a href="#rp">Research partner</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="#tpi">third party investor</a>&rdquo; are defined below. It is also allowable that an entity may serve as both a research partner and a third party investor; however, in that case, the proposal must make clear how the entity performs both roles. The expertise of the research entity(s) will complement that of the NSF-funded consortium so that competitive technologies, which neither party could develop as well or rapidly alone, are accelerated to commercial realities and transferred to the marketplace in collaboration with the third-party investor(s). These partnerships and collaborations will link multiple entities such that competitive technologies, which are derived from the NSF-funded consortium research results, are moved more rapidly into marketable solutions through the formation of new start-up businesses or strategic partnerships with existing businesses. Ideally, the relationships developed under this program will be leveraged to enable a sustainable, academic-based innovation ecosystem.</p>
          <p>This PFI:AIR-RA solicitation is aimed at technology translation and transfer, e.g., research activities necessary to accelerate the technologies with clear value propositions toward commercial realization. It is an opportunity to develop an innovation &ldquo;arm&rdquo; or thrust of an existing research consortium; e.g., a specific set of technology translation efforts in strategic partnerships with third party investor(s) and new research partner(s). A PFI:AIR-RA award will enable 1) faster translation and transfer of research results into new start-up business(es) or existing firms; 2) development or enhancement of a network of connections between the university researchers and others to build a sustainable, academic-based innovation ecosystem; and 3) preparation of students and/or post-doctoral fellows who understand the innovation and entrepreneurship processes.</p>
          <p><strong><em><a name="con"></a>NSF-funded research consortium</em></strong></p>
          <p>An NSF-funded research consortium is defined as a research partnership between/amongst universities and other entities that is formed for mutual benefit and funded by the NSF. A research consortium is based on partnerships developed between faculty members, between faculty and industry, between faculty and federal laboratories, and/or between universities to conduct research on problems typically beyond the reach of a single investigator. In addition to having research results and technology ready for translation, an NSF-funded research consortium will have an established network of connections and relationships that can be leveraged to develop and sustain the PFI:AIR-RA innovation ecosystem. Examples of NSF research consortia include but are not limited to NSF centers, such as Engineering Research Centers, Industry University Cooperative Research Centers, Science and Technology Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, Centers for Chemical Innovation, and Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers. Other examples include, but are not limited to, large, multi-year, multi-faculty/institution awards such as CISE Expeditions in Computing, CISE Frontiers, and Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI).</p>
          <p>One and only one academic institution within the NSF-funded research consortium can be the lead/submitting institution. The NSF-funded research consortium must be funded currently by NSF, or have had NSF funding 3 years or less prior to the Letter of Intent due date. If the research consortium is not currently under NSF support but within 3 years of the end of that support, it must still be functioning as a research partnership between/amongst universities and other entities and be in good standing. Additional information is required in supplementary documents to provide evidence of good standing.</p>
          <p>The narrative must provide a clear description of how a PFI:AIR-RA award would leverage the existing network of connections and established collaborations between the researchers of the existing NSF-funded research consortium. While it is not required that every participant in the underlying NSF-funded research consortium be a part of the proposed PFI:AIR-RA, it is encouraged that the proposed work takes advantage of the relevant existing expertise of current participants in the underlying research consortium as appropriate. In addition, it should be clear how a PFI:AIR-RA award would leverage the core technical capabilities and expertise of the underlying research consortium to accelerate its research results and technology developments for commercial use.</p>
          <p>If the PI of the PFI:AIR-RA proposal is not the PI of the NSF-funded research consortium, the proposal must include a letter from the PI of the NSF-funded research consortium that describes how the work proposed leverages the core mission and research/technology capabilities of the research consortium.</p>
          <p><strong><em><a name="rp"></a>Research partner</em></strong></p>
          <p>The purpose of the research partner(s) is to add a complementary skill set(s) to the underlying NSF-funded research consortium so that competitive technologies, which neither party could develop as well or rapidly alone, are accelerated to commercial realities and transferred to the marketplace. The proposal must clearly describe the role of the research partner(s), the skill set they add to the underlying research consortium and how this will help accelerate the transfer of consortium technologies. Examples of potential research partners include another research consortium or academic institution, an industry entity, a small business (for eligibility, see: <a href="http://sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf">http://sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf</a>), or a federal laboratory. This solicitation is interested in catalyzing new partnerships while leveraging the existing ones. The proposed PFI:AIR-Research Alliance must have at least one research partner as one of the required minimum of two entities partnering with the NSF-funded research consortium in the Alliance.</p>
          <p>A research partner may also contribute as a third party investor; however, the proposal must clearly describe both roles.</p>
          <p><strong><em><a name="tpi"></a>Third-party investor</em></strong></p>
          <p>In order for research to lead to competitive innovation, it is essential that third-party investment is in place as a means to accelerate the innovation towards commercialization. The collaboration among the third-party investor, the NSF-funded research consortium, and the research partner(s) will create an academic-based innovation ecosystem that offers a cost-effective, timely, and risk-reduced approach for potential investors to participate in research and development leading to new products, processes, systems or services having high commercial impact. A third-party investor may include such entities as a company, a venture capital firm, one or more individual "angel" investor(s), federal (non-SBIR), state, or local government, or any combination of the above.</p>
          <p>The maximum award size for the PFI:AIR-RA is up to $800,000 for up to 3 years per award, commensurate with the planned activities. Prior to submission of a PFI:AIR-RA proposal, the proposer must secure third-party investment commitment for the full duration of the proposal (See the <em>Special Award Conditions </em>section of this solicitation).

        <h3> <a name="elig" id="elig"></a>IV. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION</h3>
        <p><strong>Who May Submit Proposals:</strong> 
        <blockquote>Proposals may only be submitted by the following:
        
              <p>Academic institutions such as universities, two- and four-year colleges, and non-profits with a campus located in the US and accredited in the US, acting on behalf of their faculty members. The lead (submitting) organization must be an academic institution.</p>
              <p>One and only one institution within an NSF-funded research consortium can be the lead/submitting institution. An NSF-funded research consortium is defined as a research partnership between/among universities and other entities that is formed for mutual benefit and funded by the NSF. A research consortium is based on partnerships developed between faculty members, between faculty and industry, between faculty and federal laboratories, and/or between universities to conduct research on problems typically beyond the reach of a single investigator. In addition to having research results and technology ready for translation, an NSF-funded research consortium will have an established network of connections and relationships that can be leveraged to develop and sustain the PFI:AIR-RA innovation ecosystem. Examples of NSF research consortia include but are not limited to NSF centers, such as Engineering Research Centers, Industry University Cooperative Research Centers, Science and Technology Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, and Centers for Chemical Innovation. Other examples include, but are not limited to, large, multi-year, multi-faculty/institution awards such as CISE Expeditions in Computing, CISE Frontiers, and ENG Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI).</p>
           
        
        </blockquote>
       
        <p><strong>Who May Serve as PI:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A PI may submit only one proposal to this PFI:AIR-RA solicitation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong> Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There is no limit on how many proposals a university may submit, but a particular NSF-funded research consortium may submit only one to this solicitation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or Co-PI:</strong> 1</p>
  
        <p> <strong>Additional Eligibility Info:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>No collaborative proposals submitted as simultaneous proposal submissions for a joint project from different organizations (with each organization requesting a separate award) will be accepted.</p>
          <p>The submitting institution and the PI of the PFI:AIR-RA project must be engaged actively in the research consortium, and the proposal must show strong evidence of this. The research consortium must be active (e.g., still under an active NSF award) or within 3 years of the end of the NSF research consortium grant at the Letter of Intent due date. If the research consortium is within 3 years of the end of the NSF research consortium grant, it must still be functioning as a research partnership between/amongst universities and other entities and be in good standing. Additional information is required in supplementary documents to provide evidence of good standing.</p>
          <p>The PI on the PFI:AIR-RA proposal does not have to be the PI (e.g., Director) of the NSF-funded research consortium. However, if not, a letter from the PI of the NSF-funded research consortium must accompany the proposal that describes how the work proposed leverages the core mission and research/technology capabilities of the research consortium.</p>
          <p>The proposal must include partnership and collaboration with a minimum of <em>two</em> entities outside of the underlying NSF-funded research consortium. Although two is the minimum requirement and may make sense for some proposals, NSF encourages participation of multiple entities (three or more) in order to build the necessary relationships required to develop and sustain a viable innovation ecosystem. At least one of the entities must be a research partner, and at least one of these entities must be a third party investor. Examples of potential research partners include another research consortium or academic institution, an industry entity, a small business, or a federal laboratory. If one of the partners is a multi-organization entity, it counts as a single partner. A research partner may also contribute as a third party investor.</p>
          <p>The research partner(s) either will be budgeted for a subaward or will bring their own funding to the partnership. In the case of a partnership with a federally-funded National Laboratory or FFRDC (Federally Funded Research and Development Center), that center or agency must co-fund its portion of the effort because, in general, NSF funds cannot be used to support other federally-funded centers.</p>
          <p>The PFI:AIR-RA proposal must include collaboration with a third-party investor(s). Examples of third-party investor(s) include such entities as a company, a venture capital firm, an individual "angel" investor, federal (non-SBIR), state or local government, or any combination of the above.</p>
          <p>Note: It is the responsibility of the award recipients to discuss the appropriate intellectual property policies, including patent disclosures and filings, with the third-party investor(s) and research partners. NSF is not responsible for the type of agreement reached between grantees, research partners and third-party investors. Submit with the proposal a letter stating that a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/Forms/Cooperative_Agreement.docx" target="_blank">cooperative research agreement</a> (CRA; see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/Forms/Cooperative_Agreement.docx">example</a> from the SBIR/STTR program) will be provided upon recommendation of an award. If an award is recommended, the partners must follow-up by providing a signed, written CRA that has been negotiated with the partners and third-party investors before NSF funding will be released.</p>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In making the final award decisions, NSF also may consider the following:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Geographic distribution and diversity of academic institutions involved in the partnership</li>
          <li>Distribution of technology or industry sectors served</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Additional Review criteria</em>:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>The strength of the lineage of the technologies to the NSF-funded research consortium.</li>
          <li>The effectiveness of the proposed plans to translate and transfer the technology(s) into commercial realities (products, processes, and systems).</li>
          <li>The quality of the research plan, milestones, and deliverables.</li>
          <li>The quality and appropriateness of the research partnership(s).</li>
          <li>The commitment of the third-party investors.</li>
          <li>The effectiveness of the proposed plans, partnership(s), and collaboration(s) in catalyzing or enhancing a sustainable, academic-based innovation ecosystem.</li>
          <li>The effectiveness of the assessment plan and the relevance of the proposer's success metrics to the anticipated results.</li>
          <li>The net added value of the proposed work to the participating students.</li>
          <li>If the research consortium is no longer funded by NSF, the strength of the evidence that the research consortium is still functioning as a research partnership between/amongst universities and other entities and is in good standing.</li>
        </ul>
     

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
       <p> <strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
        <p>Prior to submission of a PFI:AIR-RA proposal, the proposer must secure third-party investment commitment for the full duration of the proposal. The total NSF proposal budget must not exceed the total investment from the third-party investor(s). The third-party investment(s) can be cash, liquid assets, or tangible financial instruments. Up to 25 percent of the third-party investment may be intangible assets (e.g., "in-kind"). Please note that third-party investment funding should be maintained separately from the NSF research award funding.</p>
        <p>If selected for award, initial release of NSF funds for years one and two (e.g. 70 percent of budget) shall be contingent upon receipt of third party investor(s) funding of 30 percent of total committed cash investment prior to award and a letter of commitment from third party investor(s) that the remaining 70 percent of the cash investment will be available prior to year three. The final 30 percent of NSF funding for year three will be released providing the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The PI of the NSF-funded PFI:AIR RA award, at least one research partner, and at least one third-party investor (representing a minimum of two of the partnering entities) must present and pass a mid-term review to be held in the D.C. area; details will be provided after the award is made. The presentation must show the accomplishments for the previous 18 months relative to the milestones proposed and the updated research and collaboration plans for the following 18 months, to be approved by an NSF review team.</li>
          <li>Receipt of the remaining 70 percent of the committed third-party cash investment prior to the start of the third year.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

        <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
