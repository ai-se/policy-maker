          <blockquote>
            <p>The Basic Research to Enable Agricultural Development (BREAD) Program was established in 2009 as a National Science Foundation (NSF) program supported in partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The goal of BREAD is to support innovative basic scientific research designed to address key constraints to smallholder agriculture in the developing world. Proposals submitted to BREAD must make a clear and well-defined connection between the outcomes of the proposed basic research and its direct relevance and potential application to agriculture in the developing world.</p>
            <p>In FY 2015, activities in two focus areas will be supported: (1) Developing High Throughput, Low Cost Phenotyping Tools and Devices to facilitate assessment of field-based phenotypes, especially for root and tuber crops (PHENO), and (2) Advancing Basic Research in Crop Plants Relevant to Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries (ABRDC) to develop critically needed sequence and functional genomics resources to enable basic and applied research in crop plants important for smallholder agriculture.</p>
            <p>As in past competitions, proposals are expected to address project outcomes in the context of broader societal impacts, and as appropriate to the research proposed, engage international partners in scientific collaborations.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Agriculture has benefitted from advances in genomics and the outcomes of this basic research have allowed academic and industrial researchers to expand the plant and animal breeders' toolkit, and to develop a broad range of tools to increase agronomic productivity. While support is available to promote the downstream applications derived from advances in science and technology to address constraints to developing country agriculture, there have been fewer funding opportunities to support development of cutting-edge and creative new approaches in this area.</p>
          <p>The BREAD program, a partnership between NSF and the BMGF, fosters new collaborations among a broad range of scientists and engineers aimed at a different way of thinking about the major problems facing developing country agriculture and the transformative basic research that will emerge. The activities supported by the BREAD program build on the accomplishments of the National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) and the NSF's Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the area of crop plant genomics, extending the opportunities to include international partners in efforts to generate innovative, science-based solutions to a broad range of problems of smallholder agriculture in developing countries. Through these new partnerships and projects, the BREAD program is changing the research culture to one that is more broadly inclusive of these needs.</p>

        <h3>
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The advances made through the PGRP have led to the development of resources with potential benefit far beyond U.S. agriculture. The BREAD program represents an additional opportunity within the PGRP that allows for a broader engagement of researchers across multiple disciplines and across international boundaries to form a new community of scientists who may not have worked together before by enabling funding to be provided to eligible, U.S. or non-U.S. institutions through subawards. A major distinction between the BREAD program and other programs at NSF is that proposals to the BREAD program must make a clear and well-defined connection between the outcomes of the proposed basic research and its direct relevance and potential application to smallholder farming in the developing world.</p>
          <p>The BREAD program is a component of the PGRP, which was established in FY1998 as part of the NPGI. The PGRP has followed the long-range plans for the NPGI and, working closely with the other agencies participating in the NPGI, has contributed to tremendous advances in plant genomics and plant sciences through support of new, innovative ideas in the form of basic research and tool development projects. The program is currently following the fourth five-year plan (National Plant Genome Initiative: 2014-2018; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf</a>).  While the focus of the PGRP is on plants of agricultural importance and plant processes of potential agronomic value, the goals of the BREAD program have extended beyond crop plants to include such broad basic research areas involving animals, microbes, soils, weather forecasting, and technology development. The awards made through earlier BREAD competitions can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/bread10.htm?_pims_id=503285">https://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/bread10.htm?_pims_id=503285</a>. </p>
          <p>From its inception, one focus of the BREAD program has been to support original proposals that address major constraints to the productivity of crops important to smallholder farmers, or on the development of novel and efficient production practices. In the FY 2015 competition, the BREAD program specifically solicits innovative basic research proposals in two key focus areas: (1) Development of high throughput, low cost tools and devices for capturing phenotypic data, especially for root and tuber crops (PHENO) and (2) Advancing Basic Research in Crop Plants Relevant to Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries (ABRDC) to develop critically needed sequence and functional genomics resources to enable basic and applied research in crop plants important for smallholder agriculture. </p>
          <p><strong>Focus Areas for FY 2015</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>Development of high throughput, low cost tools and devices for capturing phenotypic data, especially for root and tuber crops (PHENO)</em></strong></p>
          <p>There is a critical need for innovations in high-throughput, high resolution, phenotyping tools and platforms that are both low cost and accessible to alleviate the constraint for effective utilization of genomics data and tools for crop improvement in developing countries. Potentially high-risk, high-payoff proposals or proposals that present unconventional ideas are welcomed. In FY 2015, proposals are especially encouraged for the development of new or novel phenotyping tools and devices for root and tuber crops of relevance to smallholder farmers in developing countries.  These include but are not limited to yams, sweet potatoes and cassava. However, accessible, low cost tools and devices for any crop plant system relevant to smallholder agriculture in developing countries may be chosen as long as it is well justified for the proposed research and the outcomes of the research will advance the goals of the BREAD program.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Advancing Basic Research in Crop Plants Relevant to Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries (ABRDC) </em></strong></p>
          <p>Tremendous advances in plant genome research have been made due to the development and access of genetic resources and high throughput tools and technologies.  The Advancing Basic Research in Crop Plants Relevant to Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries (ABRDC) opportunity specifically solicits proposals that focus on the development of genetic and sequence resources and tools to enable basic and applied research in currently underfunded or understudied crop plants of relevance to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Sequence resources may include, but are not limited to, whole genome sequences, survey sequences, physical maps, and sequences that could improve genome annotations and assemblies. Genetic and functional genomic resources may include, but are not limited, genetic maps that utilize low-cost, easy-to-use molecular markers, genetic mapping populations for use in complex trait analysis [e.g., nested association mapping (NAM) population], novel strategies for gene delivery as it applies to genome editing and strategies for the efficient production of double haploid lines.  <strong>Proposers must provide a justification for the crop plant(s) selected, the type of resources to be generated, and why the resources are essential for the improvement of crops relevant to small holder farmers in the developing world.</strong>  Especially encouraged are proposals that focus on yams, sweet potatoes, cassava, banana, cowpea, chickpea, common bean, groundnut and millet. However, any crop plant system relevant to smallholder agriculture in developing countries may be chosen as long as it is well justified for the proposed research and the outcomes of the research will advance the goals of the BREAD program. Proposals focused entirely on the mapping and/or cloning of single genes associated with a specific trait in a crop plant(s) are more appropriate for funding elsewhere and may be returned without review.  Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact a Program Director prior to submission to determine the suitability of the project for BREAD.</p>
          <p><strong>For both focus areas,</strong> projects must be justified in terms of potential demand, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Proposals must describe clearly how project outcomes, including the timing and form of released data, resources, tools or materials, will be disseminated and made accessible to the public. If appropriate, plans for continued maintenance or dissemination after the award should be described without assuming long-term NSF support. Proposers are encouraged to consider the available resources and to leverage existing resources as much as possible. If other projects are under way that have overlapping goals, including international projects, proposers should present a clear plan for coordination.</p>
          <p>Proposals are solicited from single investigators, small groups, or multi-institution "virtual centers." The scale of the project in terms of personnel and budget should be developed in the context of the proposed activities. The management plan should be appropriate for the proposed activities and a carefully developed budget, research plan and timetable will strengthen a proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>Proposals that do not focus on one of the two key focus areas are beyond the scope of the competition and will be returned without review. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the Program Director for further guidance about program fit.</strong></p>
          <p>Simultaneous submission of proposals to this program and another source of funding is permissible only with prior written approval of the funding agencies involved. A proposal from the submitter that is a duplicate of, or substantially similar to, a proposal already under consideration by NSF will be returned without review.</p>
          <p><strong>Additional considerations:</strong></p>
          <p><em>International Collaboration:</em> International collaborative research is actively pursued all over the world. International research collaboration is strongly encouraged in the BREAD program, particularly with investigators from developing or developed countries, and especially where there is a common research focus or system. <strong>However, the PI must hold an appointment at an eligible U.S. institution. Proposals will not be accepted from a non-U.S. institution serving as the lead institution.</strong> Subawardee(s) may be eligible U.S. or non-U.S. institutions. Subaward activities should be clearly connected to the overall goals of the proposed research and the human and institutional capacities available for the project described for each institution.</p>
          <p>NSF requires that organizations registering to use NSF&rsquo;s electronic systems have a valid and active SAM registration and have a valid DUNS number. NSF will also validate that each proposer&rsquo;s DUNS number and SAM registration are active and valid prior to allowing submission of a proposal to NSF. Any subrecipients named in the proposal also are required to obtain a DUNS number and register in FastLane. Subrecipients named in the proposal, however, do not need to be registered in SAM. <strong>Applicants are strongly encouraged to complete registration well in advance of the proposal deadline.</strong> There are no financial requirements for registration. Information about FastLane registration is available online at <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a0/about/registration.htm">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a0/about/registration.htm</a>. Questions regarding SAM should be handled through <a href="http://www.sam.gov/">http://www.sam.gov</a> and not through the NSF or the BREAD Program.</p>
          <p><em>Industrial Collaboration:</em> Private industry has already made a significant investment in plant genomic research. Innovative collaborations with industry are encouraged when they advance the goals of the program. Participation of a company as a provider of a service should be managed according to the submitting institution's procurement policy. When private industry is involved, the proposer is responsible for ensuring that any intellectual property issues are handled according to the program policy (see section A-1 under Special Information and Supplementary Documentation below).</p>
          <p><em>Integration of Research and Education and Broadening Participation:</em> Proposers are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities to train young scientists in the course of proposed projects and to promote increased participation by members of under-represented groups. Innovative approaches to training are encouraged where they fit with the goals of the proposal and may include training of young scientists in research programs of institutions in the developing world that are building programs that aim to apply the advanced sciences to agriculture. However, proposals focused primarily on supporting existing or new training programs are not eligible and will be returned without review. A mentoring plan must be included for all supported postdoctoral researchers and students as specified under Special Information and Supplementary Documentation sections in the GPG and in A-4 (below), respectively.</p>
          <p><em>Data sharing:</em> Proposals that would generate large amounts of data or new resources such as software and other computational tools should present a plan for how these resources will be made widely available and accessible, notably to developing countries. Where appropriate, project outcomes are expected to meet current community standards for genomic data and be deposited into existing long-lived community databases. For more details, see section A-1 under Special Information and Supplementary Documentation below.</p>
          <p><em>Societal Impacts:</em> The societal benefits and potential long-term impacts on developing country agriculture of the proposed research should be integrated into the Project Description. Proposals that lack a discussion of potential societal benefits and/or long-term impacts on developing country agriculture will be less competitive than those that include this information.</p>

This plan must be specific about the nature of the results to be shared, the timing and means of release, and any constraints on release. The proposed plan must take into consideration the following conditions where applicable:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Nucleic acid sequences must be released according to the currently accepted community standard (e.g. Bermuda/Ft. Lauderdale agreement/Toronto principles) to public databases (GenBank, if applicable), as soon as they are assembled and the quality checked against a stated, pre-determined quality standard.</li>
          <li>Proposals that would develop genome-scale expression data through approaches such as microarrays should meet community standards for these data (for example, Minimum Information about a Microarray Experiment or MIAME standards: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/MIAME.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/MIAME.html</a>).  The community databases (e.g. Gene Expression Omnibus) into which the data would be deposited, in addition to any project database(s), should be indicated.</li>
          <li>If the proposed project would produce community resources (tools, devices, biological materials, software, etc.), NSF encourages that they be made available as soon as their quality is checked to satisfy the specifications approved prior to funding. The timing of release should be stated clearly in the proposal. The resources produced must be available to all segments of the scientific community, including industry. A reasonable charge is permissible, but the fee structure must be outlined clearly in the proposal. If accessibility differs between industry and the academic community, the differences must be clearly spelled out. If a Material Transfer Agreement is required for release of project outcomes, the terms must be described in detail.</li>
          <li>When the project involves the use of proprietary data or materials from other sources, the data or materials resulting from BREAD-funded research must be readily available without any restrictions to the users of such data or materials (no reach-through rights). The terms of any usage agreements should be stated clearly in the proposal.</li>
          <li>Budgeting and planning for short-term and long-term distribution of the project outcomes must be described in the proposal. If a fee is to be charged for distribution of project outcomes, the details should be described clearly in the proposal. Letters of commitment should be provided from databases or stock centers that would distribute project outcomes, including an indication of what activities would be undertaken and funds needed for these activities (if any).</li>
          <li>Submitting institutions should be aware of and abide by the general policies of NSF with respect to the patenting and licensing of any new technologies or devices that may be generated in the course of the project (see Award &amp; Administration Guide, Chapter VI Section B. Intellectual Property).</li>
          <li>In case of a multi-institutional proposal, the lead institution is responsible for coordinating and managing the intellectual property resulting from the BREAD award. Institutions participating in multi-institutional projects should formulate a coherent plan for the project prior to submission of the proposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Appendix A-1 is submitted as a supplementary document in lieu of the DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN (DMP) required of all proposals submitted to NSF (see GPG Chapter II.C.2.j). Because the DMP is required, FastLane will not allow submission of a proposal with a DMP in excess of the 2-page maximum. For this reason, please submit as a supplementary document and add the text "SEE APPENDIX A-1 UPLOADED AS A SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT" to the DMP field in FastLane.</p>

Using the template, compile an Excel Workbook that identifies conflicts of interest (COIs) for all persons listed on the Proposal Cover Page, along with other senior personnel and/or collaborators and subaward lead(s). Conflicts to be identified are (1) Ph.D. dissertation advisors and advisees, (2) collaborators or co-authors, including postdoctoral researchers, for the past 48 months, (3) coeditors within the past 24 months, (4) spouse or other relative(s), and (5) any other individuals with whom, or institutions with which, the senior personnel (PI(s), co-PI(s), and any named personnel) have financial ties, including advisory committees (specify type), boards of directors, or prospective employees. With regard to publications developed by large consortia, only co-authors that an individual has directly interacted with should be included as a conflict of interest. Members of current Advisory Committees who receive reimbursement for travel or honoraria should be included in the last category. GPG Exhibit II-2 contains information on conflicts of interest that may be useful in preparation of this list.</p>
        <p>Please follow the Instructions provided in the template. Do not use the temporary FastLane ID or a Research.Gov ID to fill out the COI template. You must use only an assigned NSF Proposal ID, which should be 7 digits long and will start with the fiscal year numbers (e.g., for FY15, all the Proposal ID's will start with "15"). Do not send in the COI template until you have been assigned the official NSF Proposal ID at the time of submission.</p>
        <p>The completed Excel Workbook should be emailed to <a href="mailto:IOScoispreadsheet@nsf.gov">IOScoispreadsheet@nsf.gov</a> immediately after you submit your proposal, but no later than the proposal deadline.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><em>International Collaboration:</em> Proposers are strongly encouraged to include one or more international collaborators as appropriate for the proposed research. Collaborations are encouraged that would build on the specific knowledge, local resources or agricultural needs of the international participants. Proposers should address the international collaboration in terms of mutual benefits, true intellectual collaboration among the international partners, benefits to be realized from the expertise and specialized skills, facilities, sites and/or resources of the international counterparts, and active research engagement of students and early-career researchers, where such individuals are engaged in the project. Where applicable, proposed research activities should be coordinated with similar efforts in other countries to maximize efficiency and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.</li>
          <li><em>Data Sharing:</em> Proposers are encouraged to consider project outcomes in the context of the broader international community and ensure maximal accessibility and visibility to all. Outcomes are expected to meet current community standards for genomics data and be deposited in long-lived community databases where appropriate.</li>
          <li><em>Integration of Research and Education and Broadening Participation:</em> Activities supported through the NSF-BMGF Program should provide an ideal environment for training young scientists in modern research technologies, introducing them to new paradigms in biology, and promoting increased participation by members of under-represented groups. NSF expects proposers to take advantage of the unique opportunities the proposed project provides in terms of education and incorporate these into the plan at a scale that is commensurate with the scale and scope of the proposed activity. Focused activities that fit well with the specific opportunities offered by the project would be viewed as a strength. However, projects that focus primarily on education or training are beyond the scope of the program and may be returned without review. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact a Program Director for additional guidance.</li>
          <li><em>Societal Impacts and Relevance to Developing Country Agriculture:</em> Issues related to societal impact, including implications for developing country agriculture with specific emphasis on smallholder farmers, should be addressed as an integral part of the proposal. These may be integrated into an education and/or outreach activity designed to communicate the significance of the outcomes to the end-users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc and panel review.</p>
        <p>One or two review panels will be assembled, depending on the number of proposals received. Some of the panelists may participate virtually.</p>
   
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
         C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
