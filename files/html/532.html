            <!--StartFragment-->
            <p class="MsoNormal">The National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) will reach its ten year authorized award life at the end of Fiscal Year 2013. The National Science Foundation is announcing in this solicitation an open competition to establish a Next-Generation National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NG NNIN) for Fiscal Years 2014-2018.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">NNIN has enabled major discoveries, innovations, and contributions to education and commerce within all disciplines of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through NSF support of a national network of university-based user facilities. These facilities have provided open access to leading-edge nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise for users across the nation from academia, small and large industry, and government. The core mission of NNIN has included national-level education and outreach programs to enable a diverse science and engineering workforce, the study of societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology including issues of environment, health, and safety, as well as important modeling and simulation capabilities.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">The new competition for the NG NNIN will build on the concept of NNIN with a much broadened scope and user base. Support is being provided by all NSF Directorates and the Office of International Science and Engineering as an integral part of the NSF investment in Nanoscale Science and Engineering.</p>

        <p><strong>Anticipated Funding Amount:</strong>
          $16,000,000
          Approximately $16,000,000 will be available annually in this competition to fund the network for each year of the five-year award duration, subject to the availability of funds. An award will be in the form of a cooperative agreement made directly with the lead institution. An individual institution within the network is limited to receiving a maximum of $2,500,000 per year for support of its facility. The lead institution may request funds beyond this limit for coordinated network purposes of management, outreach, and related activities. The initial award commitment will be for five years and may be renewed once for an additional five years, subject to external merit review. Recompetition will be required after ten years. The size of an award will depend on the plans and capabilities of the proposed network.</p>

        <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <!--StartFragment-->
          <p class="MsoNormal">The National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) will reach its ten year authorized award life at the end of Fiscal Year 2013. The National Science Foundation is announcing in this solicitation an open competition to establish a Next-Generation National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NG NNIN) for Fiscal Years 2014-2018. </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">NNIN has enabled major discoveries, innovations, and contributions to education and commerce within all disciplines of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through NSF support of a national network of university-based user facilities. These facilities have provided open access to leading-edge nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise for users across the nation from academia, small and large industry, and government. The core mission of NNIN has included national-level education and outreach programs to enable a diverse science and engineering workforce, the study of societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology including issues of environment, health, and safety, as well as important modeling and simulation capabilities.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The national investment in nanotechnology through the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)<sup>(<a href="#one">1</a>)</sup> places an important emphasis on ensuring an enabling infrastructure for future advancements in the field. The Congressional Research Service 2012 Report<sup>(<a href="#two">2</a>)</sup> for Congress on NNI, summarizing 2012 assessments by the President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and the National Research Council (NRC), underlines the importance of maintaining and expanding the nanotechnology infrastructure, including university-based user facilities such as NNIN. NNIN is a supportive component of the NNI Federal investment of about $1.7 billion per year, for which PCAST (2010)<sup>(<a href="#three">3</a>)</sup> has recommended a ten-year vision for 2011-2020 approved by the President and Congress.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">NSF recently convened a Workshop<sup>(<a href="#four">4</a>)</sup> of recognized national experts to look broadly at the future needs and appropriate investments for a national infrastructure for nanotechnology. The workshop examined the opportunities provided by a nanotechnology infrastructure as well as the needs of the scientific and technological communities for realization of these opportunities. The workshop report, noting that the NNI vision anticipates transition over the next decade from active nanostructures toward systems of nanosystems, stated that sustained and predictable access to a broad range of state-of-the-art instrumentation and facilities for synthesis, processing, fabrication, characterization, modeling, and analysis of nanomaterials and nanosystems, including bio-nanosystems, is critically needed to achieve this objective. The workshop report urged formation of a new infrastructure network that will build on the concept of NNIN with a much broadened scope and user base.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The new competition is being supported by all NSF Directorates and the Office of International Science and Engineering as an integral part of the NSF investment in Nanoscale Science and Engineering.</p>

        <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          
            <!--StartFragment-->
          <p class="MsoNormal">The new competition for a Next-Generation National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NG NNIN) builds upon the attributes sought in the original NNIN competition. </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Original Attributes</strong></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The attributes are for a network comprised of both large and small university-based user facilities, including those at minority-serving institutions, at sites that are geographically distributed and with diverse and complementary tools, instruments, and capabilities to design, create, characterize, and measure novel nanoscale structures, materials, devices, and systems. These capabilities will be made available widely to the nation&rsquo;s researchers in academe, small and large industry, and government for scientific and engineering experiments and to stimulate technological innovation. The network will encompass the full spectrum of science and engineering that spans the scale from the nano to the micro domain. The network will have the flexibility to grow or reconfigure as needs arise; the culture of open-access facilities for any research project of merit; the fostering of research, education, and outreach in diverse fields; the necessary investments in capital equipment, processes, tools, and instrumentation; and the expert staffing needed for such a role.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Equally important is provision of the infrastructure for education, training, and workforce development in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology at all levels, including K-12, technician, undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate; and for outreach programs to reach potential users in the broader science and engineering communities whose work could benefit from advanced fabrication and instrumentation capabilities. The network should develop connections with other nationally funded academic centers in nanoscale science and engineering, and with facilities supported by other Federal agencies, State governments, the private sector, and non-U.S. institutions. Successful application and development of nanotechnology will require careful consideration and analysis of associated social and ethical implications. The network should incorporate opportunities for research and related activities on these aspects.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Proposing institutions are encouraged to include the broadest range of capabilities in their network proposal. The network should provide users access not only to the specialized tools, processes, and expertise for designing, simulating, and fabricating nano- and micro-scale structures, materials, devices, and systems, but also to the specialized instrumentation for analysis, characterization, probing, and manipulation of objects at these dimensions. The network should encompass capabilities for determining fundamental physical, chemical, and biological properties; for metrology, characterization, probing, manipulation, and control; for design, modeling, and simulation; for patterning, processing, fabrication, and integration; and for other special needs. The individual sites may focus on particular subfields; however, the overall network should comprise facilities and instrumentation addressing needs across the broad science and engineering domains, including: physical-, chemical-, and biological-based nanostructures, materials, devices, and systems; nanoscale building blocks and nanostructured materials, composites, coatings, and surfaces; electronic, optical/photonic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and fluidic nanodevices and systems; geophysical, geochemical, and environmental nanostructures and processes; bioengineering and biomedical nanodevices and systems; process integration technologies, prototyping, and testing of manufacturing concepts; and other areas, as appropriate. Sites should have appropriate existing equipment base, materials and processes, tools and instrumentation. They should also have plans for acquisition, where appropriate, of new tools, instrumentation, processes, and supporting technologies that will position and maintain their facilities at the frontier.</p>
          <p><strong>Broadened Scope</strong></p>
          <p>The infrastructure of the NG NNIN will also incorporate the following major elements identified in the Nanotechnology Infrastructure Workshop report<sup>(4)</sup> to offer a much broadened scope and user base:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             Emphasis on utilization of the network nature of the program to provide value to the user community far greater than individual components.
             
            </li>
            <li>A user base that is broadened to include communities such as environmental sciences, geosciences, and biosciences.</li>
            <li>Availability of new leading-edge fabrication capability to users who require it.</li>
            <li>Capabilities to create complex and three-dimensional nanoscale systems through heterogeneous integration.</li>
            <li>Capabilities to build nanoscale systems across multiple dimensional scales through hierarchical design and fabrication.</li>
            <li>Capabilities for fabrication in soft matter including potentially biological interfaces.</li>
            <li>New generations of modeling and simulation along with the use of new design tools to maximize overall understanding and fabrication efficiency.</li>
            <li>Facilities capable of supporting the translation of discovery into prototypical elements suitable for evaluation of manufacturability and proof of business concept.</li>
            <li>Partnerships with industry, government, and other groups to provide specialized capabilities within the network when warranted, including linkages with other networks and federal infrastructure investments.</li>
            <li>Unified program of education and outreach built upon the unique nature of the network and funded at a level commensurate with the goals and directions of the program.</li>
            <li>Commitment to support and champion environmental responsibility, health, and safety (EHS) by providing direct capabilities including characterization, fabrication, and synthesis as well as establishment of the benchmark for EHS within a university environment.</li>
            <li>Incorporation of understanding of societal and ethical implications (SEI) of nanotechnology.</li>
          </ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><strong>Considerations for Individual Sites in the Network</strong></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The individual user facility sites will have considerable autonomy in their operation, management, and oversight as part of the overall network. Each institution will provide the necessary infrastructure, including appropriate laboratory, clean room, and common space and sharing of equipment, in support of an external user community. The facilities must embrace a culture of open access to qualified researchers, with protection of intellectual property, and mechanisms for encouraging non-traditional users from diverse disciplines. They should have an organizational structure that allows coordination of complex process steps and tools for integrated tasks, and acceptance of experimental risks associated with non-standard processes and materials. They should have strong underlying internal research programs that provide critical research mass and knowledge base in developing new processes, methodologies, and instrumentation. They should emphasize advanced educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, technicians, postdoctoral associates, scientists, and engineers across a broad spectrum of disciplines. They should also have a technical staff with requisite expertise to serve external and internal users and to instruct in laboratory safety, process methods, and instrumentation usage. Some sites should support exploration of the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology.</p>
      
           
           <p> <strong>Coordinating Features of the Network </strong></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">It is desired that the network have the following coordinating features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Appropriate mixture of geographically-distributed large and small facilities that provide diverse and complementary capabilities to support current and anticipated user needs for nano- and micro-scale fabrication and characterization across a broad spectrum of science, engineering, and technology domains.</li>
            <li>Effective management structure and comprehensive website to ensure close linkage and cooperation among the individual facilities such that they operate as a cohesive national network.</li>
            <li>Seamless methods of network operation that support complex user projects across facilities and remote users of facilities.</li>
            <li>Simulation and modeling computational tools appropriate to design and fabrication of nanoscale structures and systems, and effective coordination with the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN).</li>
            <li>Coordination of national-level education and outreach programs across the network, with a comprehensive assessment mechanism.</li>
            <li>Coordination of instruction and study of social and ethical implications of nanotechnology across the network that leverages its user community base.</li>
            <li>Dissemination of shared knowledge to research and development communities.</li>
            <li>Promotion of diversity and broadening participation among students, faculty, staff, management, and outreach activities.</li>
            <li>Appropriate user fee structures at all sites for academic, industry, government, international, and other researchers.</li>
            <li>Connections with other nationally funded academic research and education centers and networks in nanoscale science and engineering, and with facilities supported by other Federal agencies, State governments, the private sector, and non-U.S. institutions.</li>
            <li> Methods for assessment and quantifiable metrics of network performance and impact.</li>
            <li>Mechanisms to encourage non-traditional users from diverse disciplines.</li>
            <li>Planning process to accommodate emerging areas of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology and future growth of external and internal user base, including adding new sites to, or dropping existing sites from, the network.</li>
            <li> Establishing an external advisory board of distinguished members from academia, industry, and government to provide advice and guidance to network management. </li>
            <li>Fostering additional support from non-NSF sources, including other Federal agencies, State governments, and the private sector.</li>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
     <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>   <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
             </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
             </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
             </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

        <h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by a combination of mail and panel review followed by reverse site review. </p>
        <!--StartFragment-->
        <p class="MsoNormal">A working group of program officers from the participating Directorates/Divisions/Offices, coordinated by ENG/ECCS, will jointly oversee all aspects of the NG NNIN program, including the review and award recommendation process, development of cooperative agreements, and post-award oversight.  </p>
        <!--EndFragment-->
      <a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
