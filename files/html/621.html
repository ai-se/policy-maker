<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="masb" id="masb"></a>Question: Must an STC be centered on a Technology?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. STCs may involve development and/or deployment of  significant, new technologies, but this is not a requirement. Some centers are  primarily science oriented; others are primarily focused on technologies. It is  also the case that "technology" is defined broadly for the purposes  of this competition. A technology may be a tool, technique, infrastructure,  system or method.</p>

<h2><strong>Education Plan</strong></h2>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="hiso" id="hiso"></a>Question: How involved should our Center be in education?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: NSF expects each Center to make the education of students who  are U.S. citizens, nationals and permanent residents a high priority and to  apply the same scholarly mind-set to education as to research. These  undergraduate and graduate students represent the next generation of the  Nation's intellectual capital. A Center  is expected to understand the challenges facing education in its areas of  research, and the potential contributions that the Center has to address those  challenges. The contributions desired by the Center then drive the design of  specific educational activities and their evaluation. There should be at least one person with  extensive educational expertise on the center's Advisory Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="aset" id="aset"></a>Question: Are STCs expected  to propose activities at many different levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate,  and post-doc)? </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No.  The education efforts of a center should be focused on a few activities  that are substantial, with high potential impact and that make sense for the  center. A concentrated in-depth effort  that is linked to the research of the center is more likely to have an impact  than a large number of superficial unrelated efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="step" id="step"></a>Question: Should the education programs proposed be  new activities?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If possible, the Center's education and  diversity efforts can be built on existing, successful efforts. However, the Center's involvement should  significantly expand these efforts and the value added by the Center's  involvement should be clear. For  education and diversity activities that represent new initiatives, proposals should  indicate all collaborations or connections that will enable these activities  and provide a basis for estimating the likelihood of success.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="mech" id="mech"></a>Question: Must each Center have K-12 activities?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No, there is no  requirement for K-12 activities. Each Center should undertake activities at the  level of education that serves the Center research and education goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="hmds" id="hmds"></a>Question: How much detail should be provided if the  educational focus is on undergraduate students, K-12 or other education activities?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: In  all cases, proposals should contain enough detail such that reviewers can  evaluate the importance of the effort and the likelihood of success. For example, proposals that include a focus  on undergraduate education activities should reflect current understanding of  how students learn in STEM fields and engage pedagogy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Diversity Plan</strong></h2>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="asrt" id="asrt"></a>Question: Are STCs required to  partner with a minority serving institutions?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are no requirements for involving  specific types of institutions. It is expected  that any partnership developed by STCs will be mutually beneficial and involve  all participants (institutions, faculty and students) in the Center's  activities (research, education and knowledge transfer). In this spirit, STCs  should look for partners who share and can implement the full vision of the  center. Broadening the participation of  under-represented minorities in Science and Engineering is an important goal of  the STC program. Inclusion of minority  institutions in STCs is one mechanism that can be used to achieve that goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="asrt2" id="asrt2"></a>Question: Are STCs required to have a full time  diversity director or coordinator?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Having a full time diversity coordinator  is a commonly used and proven mechanism for increasing representation. However we recognize that there might be  other effective models for integrating practices to increase representation  into the culture of a center. The  diversity plan should describe the research or existing practices that provide  the rationale for the planned diversity activities. This discussion should demonstrate an  understanding of the issues involved and support the choices the Center has  made. The diversity plan should indicate  who will participate in diversity activities, ensure that all participating  institutions are involved substantially in some of these activities and that  none of the activities are relegated to a single institution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Knowledge Transfer</strong></h2>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="hisa" id="hisa"></a>Question: How involved should a center be in knowledge transfer and  innovation?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  Centers must undertake activities that facilitate transfer to external  stakeholders of knowledge developed as result of research and education  activities in the center. The exchange  of scientific and technical information aims to disseminate and utilize  knowledge broadly in other areas of science and engineering, industry, public  policy and other sectors. The purpose may be enabling and supporting innovation  in other fields of research, supporting innovation for development of new  products and services in industry and commerce, providing updated materials for  education and training, or informing decision makers in a timely manner on new  research outcomes. Generating  inventions, technology transfer to small businesses or large companies, and  creating spin-off companies are part of the innovation process. Partnerships with diverse private and public  organizations offer a means to realize these goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Eligibility</strong></h2>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="manf" id="manf"></a>Question: May a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) submit a proposal if it contains  at least one or two U.S. academic institutions with significant research and  degree-granting education programs as well as national laboratories and state  and local government laboratories?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. The lead institution submitting an STC preliminary or  full proposal must be a U.S. academic institution with research and  degree-granting education programs in any area of science and engineering  normally supported by NSF. A not-for-profit 501(c)(3) can be a partner with the  lead institution that submits the STC preliminary or full proposal, but cannot  be the lead institution itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Budgets for Preliminary Proposal and Full Proposal</strong></h2>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="dtmp" id="dtmp"></a>Question: Does the $5 million per year maximum budget request refer  only to direct costs or is it both direct and indirect costs.</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The maximum request  of $5 million per year includes both direct and indirect costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="swsa" id="swsa"></a>Question: Should we submit a budget in the preliminary proposal.</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. A budget should not be submitted in the  preliminary proposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="swsa2" id="swsa2"></a>Question: Should we submit a budget for each subawardee or  participating institution in the full proposal?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: For the full  proposal, a budget for each subawardee is required. The lead institution budget  should show total amounts; the sum of all the subawardee budgets should add up  to the amount shown on the lead institution budget page for subawardees.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="ocat" id="ocat"></a>Question: Our center anticipates that we will need  support from other existing NSF large scale facilities or research  infrastructure resources. Should the cost and availability of these facilities  be discussed and included in our STC budget request?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, where this is known, or can be  parametrically estimated (e.g. hours of telescope or beam time, days of ship or  field support, computational resources etc), it should be included in budget  requests. Realism of such requests may be a review consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Cost Sharing </strong></h2>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="icsr" id="icsr"></a>Question: Is cost  sharing required?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No, voluntary committed cost-sharing  is prohibited and Line M on the proposal budget will not be available for use  by the proposer. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="wnci" id="wnci"></a>Question: Will NSF consider  institutional contributions?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>In order to assess  the scope of the project, all institutional resources (including those from  partner organizations) necessary for the project must be described in the  Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section. The description should be  narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial  information. These resources are not financially auditable by NSF and should  not be included in the proposal budget or budget justification.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>STC Directors</strong></h2>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="apre" id="apre"></a>Question: Are permanent residents eligible to be prospective STC  directors?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="witd" id="witd"></a>Question: What is  the difference between a Center Director and a Managing Director?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Center Director: The  Center Director must provide the leadership to develop and lead a diverse team  to fulfill the vision of the Center, serve as the liaison between the national  network of STC directors and NSF. The  Center Director must ensure that the STC develops the ability to communicate  effectively with NSF and the other STCs electronically, including web-based  distribution of information and Video conferencing capability.</p>
<p>Managing Director:  The Managing Director is responsible for the management, staffing, and  resource allocation of the Center, in conjunction with the Center Director. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="wdea" id="wdea"></a>Question: What do  education and diversity coordinators do?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Education Coordinator/Director<strong>: </strong>Integrate education with  the research conducted at the center through management of undergraduate and  graduate programs. Develop an evaluation  plan to be used in monitoring the expected education outcomes. Possibly foster education through innovative  activities and outreach to K-12 students, either physically or virtually.</p>
<p>Diversity  Coordinator/Director: Work with the membership of the center to ensure  that the diversity objectives are met. For example, the diversity  coordinator could work with the center director on issues related to faculty  and staff diversity, and/or work with the educational coordinator to identify  means with which to attract and prepare students from under-represented  minority groups, female students and students with disabilities for careers in  the sciences or industries associated with the center. The diversity  coordinator should also be responsible for developing an evaluation plan for  monitoring diversity outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Notice of Intent</strong></h2>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="dnrl" id="dnrl"></a>Question: Does NSF require letters of intent for this competition  as it did in some earlier competitions?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. Letters of intent are not required, and should not be  submitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Lists of Institutions, Project Personnel, and  Collaborators - Conflicts of Interest</strong></h2>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="tsps" id="tsps"></a>Question: The STC Program Solicitation asks for lists of  institutions, project personnel, and collaborators with Conflicts of Interest.  What constitutes a Conflict of Interest?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: In addition to lists of institutions and project personnel,  the STC Program Solicitation requires that Principal Investigators provide, to  the best of their ability, a list of all collaborators, participants and affiliates,  to aid NSF in identifying reviewers who may have potential conflicts of  interest with any of the project's personnel (PI, co-PI, and other personnel).</p>
<p>We realize that a PI cannot  be expected to know all the details of conflicts of interest for the entire  potential reviewing community. To assist you in knowing what constitutes a  conflict of interest we have provided guidance below. For purposes of the STC  collaborators list, please concentrate your efforts on providing us with  information for those collaborators whose conflicts of interest can be found  under the first major grouping below, namely, "Personal Relationship with  an Investigator, Project Director, or Other Person Who Has a Personal Interest  in the Proposal or Other Application."</p>
<p>When your preliminary  proposal or full proposal is reviewed by the National Science Foundation,  reviewers will also be asked to disclose as potential conflicts of interest any  of their affiliations and relationships in the areas listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PERSONAL       RELATIONSHIP WITH AN INVESTIGATOR, PROJECT DIRECTOR, OR OTHER PERSON WHO       HAS A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE PROPOSAL OR OTHER APPLICATION</strong><br />

</blockquote>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="awst" id="awst"></a>Question: After we submit the preliminary or full proposal, are we  to update the conflicts of interest information?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Once the preliminary (or full) proposal is submitted,  any changes in the participating institutions, personnel, collaborators,  subcontractors, or other affiliates can't be made to the proposal (preliminary  or full). However, it is important to notify NSF of changes as they occur, for  the purpose of identifying potential conflicts of interest during the review  process. Updated information should be sent by the lead institution to <a href="mailto:stc2013@nsf.gov">stc2013@nsf.gov</a> as soon as it is available.  Updated completed information will be requested prior to a site visit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Required Supplementary Information </strong></h2>
<ol start="26" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="tpaf" id="tpaf"></a>Question: The preliminary and full proposals require a list of  Partner Institutions and a List of Project Personnel to be submitted as part of  the Supplementary Documents. Is this the same information that is required to  be sent by email in a spreadsheet? Why do we provide this information in two  places?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The information provided on Project Personnel and Partner Institutions  in the Supplementary Documents and in the spreadsheet to be sent by email is  similar. As a Supplementary Document, the lists of 1) Project Personnel and 2)  institutions and organizations providing project personnel are seen by reviewers  and provide a comprehensive view of the makeup of the proposed Center. The  spreadsheet, sent by email and available only to NSF staff, provides an easily  searchable data set to identify center project personnel and potential  conflicts of interest as NSF staff select reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="itif" id="itif"></a>Question</strong>: Is the information for the Supplementary Documents and in  the spreadsheet to be emailed optional?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. Complete and accurate information, in the proper  format, is required for both the preliminary and full proposals submitted to  this competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="cicm" id="cicm"></a>Question: Can I create my own conflicts of interest spreadsheet to  send by email?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. Specific information on project personnel, their  affiliations and conflicts of interest is required to be provided, and must be  submitted by email (<a href="mailto:stc2013@nsf.gov">stc2013@nsf.gov</a>) using  the template provided (at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc">http:www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc</a>)  and by the dates listed in the solicitation. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="dint" id="dint"></a>Question: Do I  need to include a postdoctoral mentoring plan in my STC proposal?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Postdoctoral mentoring plans, when  applicable, are required for only Full Proposals; they are not to be submitted  for preliminary proposals. If postdoctoral scholars are included on line B.1 of  the budget page, a one page postdoctoral mentoring plan must submitted via  FastLane or Grants.gov. The plan will appear as a supplement document in the  proposal and will not be counted as part of the Project Description page limit.  This plan should detail specifics about how postdocs supported by the STC grant  will be mentored. Even though a STC typically involves multiple departments and  institutions, only one postdoc mentoring plan is allowed; any additional  details about postdoctoral mentoring will have to appear in the Project  Description. PIs submitting a STC proposal should consult the Grant Proposal  Guide as to the appropriate information included in the postdoctoral mentoring  plan. The plan will be reviewed as part of the broader impacts of the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="nnra" id="nnra"></a>Question: NSF now requires a data management plan be submitted with  all proposals. Is a data management plan required as part of the STC  preliminary proposal?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. A data management plan  is not required for an STC preliminary proposal and should not be submitted as  a supplementary document. If data management and/or the sharing of the products  of research form an important component of the planned STC these issues should  be discussed as part of the preliminary proposal's Project Description.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Federal Government Laboratory Partnerships</strong></h2>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="tpsm" id="tpsm"></a>Question: The Program  Solicitation mentions collaborations and partnerships with National  Laboratories. Can you tell me what limitations apply to these collaborations  regarding funding resources? In particular, is it possible to provide money  directly to lab personnel for salary, travel, and hiring of students and  post-docs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The STC Program encourages partnerships with Federal  Government laboratories, including the National Laboratories operated by the  Department of Energy. However, NSF does not typically reimburse costs that are  covered by another agency's appropriations. NSF funding of federal employees  such as lab personnel is generally not appropriate (see Chapter V.B of the NSF  Award and Administration Guide).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>International Collaboration</strong></h2>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="hdnv" id="hdnv"></a>Question: How does  NSF view international collaboration?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: NSF  promotes international collaboration when it provides U.S. students and  researchers the opportunity to benefit from foreign expertise and/or from  resources, equipment, data and geographically-based phenomena that are located  abroad. PI's are encouraged to consider how international engagement can  provide a collaborative advantage to the Center's research agenda as well as to  its efforts to help develop a globally engaged U.S. workforce. NSF  encourages a close working arrangement with local scientists and engineers in  all international components of research projects. Projects in a foreign  country should be designed to be of mutual benefit and must encourage wide  distribution of the resulting materials, data, analyses, and publications  within the host country as well as in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="iiat" id="iiat"></a>Question: Is it  acceptable to include international industries as well as academics in the  STCs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: There is no  problem with either academic or industrial international collaboration as long  as it can be justified as an integral part of the proposed Center's activities.  Many of the currently supported STCs include both types of international collaboration.  However, the foreign partners, not NSF, must provide funding for their own  participation in international academic or industrial collaborations. Also, it  is recommended that institutions consider and establish policies for  intellectual property rights with their international partners as early as  possible in project development.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="cafi" id="cafi"></a>Question: Can a  foreign institution, as a partner or subcontractor, be financed with funds from  an STC award?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: NSF does not  expect to fund foreign institutions as partners or subcontractors. <em>Extraordinary </em>circumstances may be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as activities  that require unique foreign expertise, access to unique foreign facilities,  unique foreign data resources not generally available to U.S. investigators (or  which would require significant effort or time to duplicate), or other foreign  resources that are essential contributing factors to the success of the  proposed project<strong> </strong><em>and which cannot be funded from sources in  the foreign country.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="gswo" id="gswo"></a>Question: Graduate  students working on our proposed STC will be supported as research assistants.  I assume that these positions would be open to any qualified foreign or U.S.  student that we admit to our graduate programs, as is the case with an NSF  grant. Are there restrictions on appointing research assistants?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: One of the  goals of the STC Program is to increase the numbers of educated U.S. citizens,  nationals and permanent residents by increasing the numbers of U.S.  undergraduate students, graduate students and post-docs engaged in science and  engineering. The STC Program Solicitation does not specifically rule out  research assistantships to foreign students. However, if a proposed Center is  to meet the goals of the STC program for educating U.S. citizens, national and  permanent residents, then the proposed Center should plan for U.S. citizens,  national and permanent residents (undergraduates and graduates) to be the  principal, if not exclusive, recipients of educational aid and research  assistant appointments. It would be difficult to see how a proposed Center's  educational component could be acceptable if it did not include a large  preponderance of U.S. citizens, national and permanent residents as  beneficiaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="opcd" id="opcd"></a>Question: Our  proposed Center does not include an "exchange program" as such.  However, we would like to propose paying for "three-month living  stipends" for students from collaborating institutions in foreign  countries to visit members of the Center for cooperative research and training.  Are there restrictions on this type of activity?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: In general,  the country (U.S. or foreign) sending the students is expected to pay for their  travel to and expenses in the receiving country (U.S. or foreign). The STC  Program rarely supports activities to bring foreign students to the U.S. since  one of the goals of the Program is to educate U.S. citizens, national and  permanent residents as students and post-docs engaged in science. Extraordinary  cases may be considered on a case-by-case basis. There can also be exceptions  for students from countries whose currency is not convertible and from  developing countries that do not have resources to support such activities.  Additionally, NSF encourages arrangements for exchanges of students wherein the  hosting institution provides for living expenses on a reciprocal basis.  NSF and the U. S. Agency for International Development signed a Memorandum of  Understanding that may provide an opportunity for funding such students when  the focus of the project is in a country and discipline that matches USAID's  strategic objectives. Programs and award supplements may be available through  NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering to support these  activities. PI's should contact the STC representative in NSF's Office of  International Science and Engineering (<a href="http://www.inside.nsf.gov/od/oise/"></a><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OISE">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OISE</a>)  for further information.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="iiaf" id="iiaf"></a>Question: Is it  acceptable for a foreign laboratory to allocate and pay for a foreign  post-graduate fellowship for our proposed STC?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: There is no  problem with a foreign laboratory's paying for foreign post-graduate  fellowships at an STC.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Next  STC Competition</strong></h2>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li><strong><a name="atcs" id="atcs"></a>Question: After the current STC competition is completed, when will  the next STC competition begin?</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Pending availability of funds, the next STC  competition is expected to start three years from the start of this  competition. The Program Solicitation for the current competition is expected  serve as the Program Solicitation for the next competition, subject to change.  The deadline dates and review schedule for the next competition, although not  yet determined, should be similar to those for the currently announced  competition. The STC web site will be updated with information regarding the  next competition when deadline dates for preliminary proposals and full  proposals are better known.</p>
