          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The National Science Foundation offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. </p>
          <p>The goal of the SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (SPRF) program is to promote fundamental research in the SBE sciences; enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering; provide an opportunity for independence and advanced training under the direction of a sponsor; and encourage doctoral-level scientists (who are not yet in full-time positions) to take advantage of the two-year fellowship to prepare for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government.</p>
       
         <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
         <h3>
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p class="Default">II.1. Areas of Research:  The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=SBE">Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)</a> supports research in a broad range of disciplines and in interdisciplinary areas through its <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=BCS">Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) Division</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?org=SES">Social and Economic Sciences (SES) Division</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=SMA">SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA)</a>. The prospective Fellowship Candidate and Sponsoring Scientist (Mentor) should visit the web pages hyperlinked in this section to get detailed information of the research fields/themes/topics supported by the SBE Directorate. <strong>Any research field within the purview of the SBE sciences, as described in the above web sites, would be welcome.</strong></p>
          <p>II.2. Tracks: This SPRF program offers two tracks of Fellowships. For both of these tracks, proposals are encouraged from a wide range of doctoral-level investigators including those from groups that continue to be underrepresented in their field. Some proposals may contain elements of both tracks, in such cases <strong>it is up to the Fellowship Candidate to choose which track to submit his or her proposal</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Track 1: Fundamental Research in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-FR):</strong></p>
          <p>The SPRF-FR track aims to support research that builds fundamental knowledge of human behavior, interaction, social and economic systems, organizations and institutions. The proposal must primarily fall within the purview of the SBE sciences &ndash; this includes programs supported through the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES), and SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA). Specifically, this includes but is not limited to research to develop and advance scientific knowledge on human behavior, human cognition, language, social and organizational behavior and culture as well as research on the interactions between human societies and the physical environment. Interdisciplinary research with a primary SBE focus is also supported. The proposal must be motivated by a compelling research question (within the fields of social, behavioral and economic sciences). To acquire the requisite skills and competencies, a sponsoring scientist within the designated SBE field must be selected so that the postdoctoral research fellow and his or her sponsor will complement each other's expertise. Proposals in the FR track will be evaluated on three general dimensions: first, the degree to which results would enhance theories and/ or methodological approaches in the SBE sciences; second, the strength of the proposed Fellow-Sponsoring Scientist team and host institution; and third, the promise of Fellow&rsquo;s investigation of driving research questions and future career development.</p>
          <p>In addition to the scientific research, all proposals for the SPRF-FR track must include a specific section within the Project Description with the heading "<strong>How this fellowship will advance fundamental scientific knowledge in the SBE sciences </strong>".</p>
          <p><strong>Track 2: Broadening Participation in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-BP)</strong></p>
          <p>The SPRF-BP track offers fellowships in an effort to increase the diversity of post-doctoral level researchers who participate in NSF programs in the social, behavioral and economic sciences and thereby increase the participation of scientists from underrepresented groups in selected areas of science in the United States. Data from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsb20161/#/">National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (2016)</a> has demonstrated that that members of certain ethnic/racial groups (i.e., American Indians or Alaska Natives, Blacks or African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders) in addition to individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in the SBE sciences in the U.S.   The problem of underrepresentation in the nation's scientific enterprise has been well-documented and reported in the literature. The goal of the SPRF-BP track is to prepare underrepresented SBE scientists and others who share NSF&rsquo;s diversity goals for positions of scientific leadership in academia, industry, and government. The research and training plan in these applications must fall within the purview of the SBE sciences (see Section II.1 for details) at NSF, including research on the topic of broadening participation (see SBE's Dear Colleague Letter <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14038">NSF 14-038</a> for more details on the science of broadening participation). The SPRF program also welcomes proposals on research to develop and advance scientific knowledge on human behavior, human cognition, language, social and organizational behavior and culture as well as research on the interactions between human societies and the physical environment. Interdisciplinary research with a primary SBE focus is also supported. To acquire the requisite skills and competencies a sponsoring scientist within the designated SBE field must be selected so that the postdoctoral research fellow and his or her sponsor will complement each other's expertise. Proposals in the BP track will be evaluated on three general dimensions: first, the degree to which results would enhance theories and/ or methodological approaches in the SBE sciences; second, the strength of the proposed Fellow-Sponsoring Scientist team and host institution; and third, the promise of Fellow&rsquo;s investigation of driving research questions and future career development.</p>
          <p>In addition to the scientific research, all proposals for the SPRF-BP track must include a specific section within the Project Description with the heading "<strong>How this fellowship will help broaden or inform efforts to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the United States</strong>".</p>
        

              <p><strong>A. Location of Work</strong> (Host Institution)</p>
       
       
          <p>Research and training supported by these fellowships may be conducted at any appropriate U.S. host institution including academic institutions (colleges and universities) and non-profit organizations (independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies). Because the objectives of the fellowship include preparing Fellows for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government, careful consideration should be given to the selection of the sponsoring scientist and host institution.</p>
          <p>If a fellowship is offered, the applicant will be requested to provide documentation from the host institution that the Fellow will be affiliated with that institution by the award start date and that the Fellow will be provided with adequate mentoring, space, basic services, needed resources, and supplies. Once an application is submitted, any changes in location or sponsorship of the Fellow must be approved in advance by the cognizant program officer. Any changes in scope, location or sponsorship after an award is made must be entered into the Research.gov "Notifications and Requests" module using the "Change in Scope" or "PI Transfer" options and then approved by NSF.</p>
          <p>Note: The "Location of Work" does not constrain the Fellow to spend the entire Fellowship tenure at that location. If required for the project, the Fellow can spend extended periods of time outside of the official location of work; for example, travel to other locations or to foreign countries, as needed for data collection, field research, or collaborative activities, will be allowed. International research activities and collaboration are welcome. Under specific guidelines from NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) extra travel and research expenses may be allowed. See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/iprffapp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/iprffapp.jsp</a> for details.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Sponsoring Scientist (Mentor)/co-Sponsors</strong></p>
          <p>The Fellow must affiliate with a host institution at all times during the entire tenure of the fellowship and select a sponsoring scientist from that host institution who will provide mentoring and guidance for both the research and training proposed by the applicant. The applicant is responsible for making prior arrangements with the host institution and sponsoring scientist. Regardless of the number of sponsors, the fellowship application requires a single postdoctoral mentoring plan. When more than one sponsor is proposed, one must be named lead sponsor and information from all sponsors must be integrated into a single postdoctoral mentoring plan. An important basis for judging the suitability of the host institution is the degree to which the postdoctoral mentoring plan describes and offers an appropriate research environment and a well-developed mentoring plan.</p>

          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Support may be requested for up to 24 months at a level of $69,000 per year and may be prorated accordingly. A no-cost extension may be requested to extend the Fellowship award in order to complete the goals of the Fellowship, but no supplemental funds will be provided for this purpose. Within the fellowship period, up to two months of the fellowship duration may be used for paid leave, including parental or family leave. The paid leave cannot be used to increase the level of the Fellow&rsquo;s salary support beyond 24 months. NSF enables career-life balance through a variety of mechanisms. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/">https://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/</a>.</p>
          <p>Those applicants selected to receive fellowships will be contacted by NSF and asked to provide additional information, such as completing acceptance forms and starting certificates, before starting their fellowship tenure. Successful applicants who have not completed the PhD at the time of the application must provide certification of the completion of all PhD degree requirements before receiving funds from their fellowship award. Fellowship tenure begins on the first of the month only and may commence at the Fellow's request between June and September of the award year. Fellowships may not be renewed. </p>

        </ul>
        <p> <strong>Guidance on the Project Description (Research and Training Plan):</strong></p>
        <p>The research and training plan presents the research that the Fellow will conduct and the training that he or she will receive during the fellowship period and how they relate to the stated career goals. Part I - the Research Plan (up to 10 pages) should include: a) a theoretically-grounded  introduction or background section; b) a statement of research objectives, methods, and significance; and c) a specific section describing either the Fundamental Research or Broadening Participation nature of the project, as appropriate for Track I or II (see Section II.1 and II.2 of this document for details). As with all NSF proposals, in addition to intellectual merit, broader impacts must also be addressed in this section. Part II - the Training Plan (up to 3 pages) should include: a) training objectives and the plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities); b) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance the Fellow's career development and future research directions; c) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist and host institution; and d) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes.</p>
        <p>Limited amounts of teaching activity (no more than one course at a time) may be incorporated into the proposal, if such teaching experience is valuable for the Fellow's future career development. In such cases the Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan must include the motivation and justification for this teaching plan.</p>
        <p>Some applications may require other documentation before the final decision can be made. Fellowship Candidates whose research involves human subjects or vertebrate animals must be aware of the regulations and guidelines pertaining to these types of research. Successful Fellowship Candidates must provide NSF with documentation that the research has been reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional committees, giving assurance of compliance with all Federal policies on research using humans and the care and use of animals. These requirements are relevant to both laboratory and field projects. Acknowledgement of human subjects or use of animals in the research should be noted on the Cover Sheet. Documentation of approval for use of human subjects or vertebrate animal must be provided prior to the award. See the Grant Proposal Guide for additional information.</p>
        <p>Special certifications and permits must be provided when projects involve collecting data/ samples in foreign countries, endangered species, or hazardous materials. Some applications may require other documentation before the final decision can be made, e.g., government permits, letters of collaboration, and commitments from private sources. If a fellowship is offered, the applicant will be requested to provide documentation from the host institution (see Section II.B). Fellowship Candidates must submit the information when requested by the NSF Program Officer managing the program.</p>
        <p><strong>Guidance on the Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan:</strong></p>
        <p>The postdoctoral mentoring plan is meant to demonstrate how the proposed sponsor(s) and host institution provide the best environment for the Fellow's proposed research and training plan and form the basis for a future independent research career. Therefore, it should include a specific mentoring plan, a description of how the Fellow's independence will be nurtured, and what aspects of the project, if any, cannot go when the Fellow leaves. Regardless of the number of sponsors, one integrated statement must be developed and submitted. If the Fellow plans to teach as part of career development activities, the Fellow is limited to teaching in a course directly related to the Fellow's doctoral or fellowship area of research. The postdoctoral mentoring plan must detail the mentoring that the Fellow will receive on teaching if applicable. Sponsors are not expected to provide all the mentoring themselves and may call on all resources available on campus or through other organizations, <em>e.g</em>., professional societies, postdoctoral offices, etc.</p>
        <p>A complete postdoctoral mentoring plan consists of the following items:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A brief description of the research projects in the host research group(s). If any sponsor has submitted similar research for funding, the degree of overlap must be addressed.</li>
          <li>A description of how the research and training plan for the applicant would fit into and complement ongoing research of the sponsor(s) as well as an indication of the personnel with whom the Fellow would work.</li>
          <li>An explanation of how the sponsor(s) will determine what mentoring the applicant needs in research, teaching, and career development skills and how these would be translated into a specific plan that fosters the development of the applicant's future independent research career.</li>
          <li>A description of the role the sponsor(s) will play in the proposed research and training and the other resources that will be available to the Fellow to complete his or her training plan during the fellowship.</li>
          <li>A description of the limitations, if any, that will be placed on the Fellow regarding the research following the fellowship.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Proposal-submission Check List</strong></p>
        <p>This checklist is provided to aid in the preparation of the proposal, the burden to ensure that the proposal is complete and meets all of the solicitation requirements remains with the applicant. Proposers are reminded to identify the NSF publication number (located on the first page of this document) in the program solicitation block on the NSF Cover Sheet for Proposal to the National Science Foundation.

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
    
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
 
        <p>SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship proposals will be reviewed by a panel of disciplinary and interdisciplinary experts as appropriate, spanning all areas of SBE sciences. Ad-hoc reviews may also be sought if deemed necessary. In addition to the regular NSF review criteria, reviewers/panelists will also consider the following criteria for Fellowship proposals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the Sponsoring Scientist and host institution a good match to the Fellowship Candidate's proposed project, and does the Sponsoring Scientist's involvement in the project strike the right balance between supervisory guidance and the Fellow's independent growth?</li>
          <li>How well-developed are the Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan and the Data Management Plan?</li>
          <li>For Track I (FR) and Track II (BP): How significant is the potential contribution of this research on the SBE sciences, in general, and the specific discipline area(s) identified by this proposal?</li>
          <li>For Track II (BP): How do the proposed activities help broaden (directly, indirectly, or both; via the research, or training and outreach activities, or both) or inform efforts to broaden the participation and advancement of underrepresented groups in the SBE sciences or, in general, STEM fields, in the U.S.?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
        <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
