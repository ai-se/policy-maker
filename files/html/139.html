        <h3> IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES </h3>
         
        
          <p>The following notable changes have been made to the previous PFI: AIR-TT solicitation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf15570">NSF-15-570</a>) Minor changes also may be present; proposers are encouraged to read the full solicitation carefully.</p>
          <ol>
          <li> There is an adjustment to the lineage requirements such that this solicitation allows two possible lineage paths: lineage of research results from a prior NSF award, <strong>OR</strong> lineage to customer discovery results through graduation from a National NSF-funded I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> program.</li>
         <li>In prior solicitations, there have been two submission windows per year.  This solicitation allows only <strong>one</strong> submission window with Letters of Intent due on September 8, 2016 and full proposals due October 11, 2016. There is no spring submission window.</li></ol>
       
          <p>Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16001">NSF 16-1</a>), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 25, 2016.</p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) program within the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) is an umbrella for two complementary subprograms, Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) and Building Innovation Capacity (BIC). Overall, the PFI program offers opportunities to connect new knowledge to societal benefit through translational research efforts and/or partnerships that encourage, enhance and accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship. The subject of this solicitation is PFI: AIR-Technology Translation (PFI: AIR-TT). The PFI: AIR-TT solicitation serves as an early opportunity to move previously NSF-funded research results with promising commercial potential along the path toward commercialization. Projects are supported to demonstrate proof-of-concept, prototype, or scale-up while engaging faculty and students in entrepreneurial/innovative thinking.</p>
            <p><strong>WEBINAR: A webinar will be held the end of July or early August, 2016 to answer any questions about this solicitation. Details will be posted on the IIP website </strong>(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/air-tt.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/air-tt.jsp</a>)<strong> as they become available.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Who May Serve as PI:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Lineage Requirement:</strong> <strong>There are two paths to meet the lineage requirement: through NSF-supported research results, or NSF-supported (National I-Corps<sup>TM</sup>) customer discovery results </strong></p>
          <ol>
          <li>Principal Investigator (PI) or a co-PI must have had an NSF award that ended no more than 6-years prior to the chosen submission window&rsquo;s full proposal deadline date or be a current NSF award recipient. The proposed proof-of-concept or prototype/ scale-up must be derived from the research results and/or discoveries from this underlying NSF award <strong>-OR-</strong></li>
          <br />
          <li>The Principal Investigator (PI) or a co-PI must have graduated as part of an NSF cohort from an NSF-funded National I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> program within the past 3 years. The proposed proof-of-concept or prototype/ scale-up must be based on technology for which customer discovery activities were performed under the I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> national training.  In other words, it is <strong>not</strong> sufficient to just have had I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> training; rather the customer discovery activities performed under the NSF-funded I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> grant need to be based on the technology that is proposed to be translated within the AIR-TT proposal.   </li></ol>
          <p>Note: a proposal describing sole lineage to any of the following programs is not allowed and <strong>may be returned without review</strong>: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), PFI: AIR-TT, PFI: AIR-RA, Regional I-Corps<sup>TM</sup>, and SBIR/STTR.</p>
          <p>The PI must be a faculty member at a U.S. academic / research institution at the time of the award.</p>
          <p>In addition to the PI, there must be at least one other participant on the project (e.g., someone listed as a co-PI, Senior Personnel, Other Professional, subawardee, consultant, collaborator, etc.) with explicit business experience (for example, someone from the technology transfer office, the business school, a local/regional development office, a business entity, etc.). This person must have an active role that is explicitly described along with the specification of a time commitment on the project.</p>

        <p><strong>Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or Co-PI:</strong> 1</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>No person may participate as the PI for more than one proposal submitted to any submission window of this PFI: AIR-TT solicitation.  A PI may submit to consecutive submission windows; however, a resubmitted proposal that has not clearly taken into account the major comments or concerns resulting from the prior NSF review may be returned without review. The Foundation will treat the revised proposal as a new proposal, subject to the standard review procedures.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports fundamental research and education in science and engineering to advance basic knowledge and provide benefit to society. The preponderance of NSF-funded research supports the discovery that enables innovation. It lays the scientific and engineering knowledge base for technological innovation to prosper. In synergy with this, research supported by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) aims to systematically facilitate and accelerate the use of basic research results such that discovery is translated to innovation to realize its commercialization potential. In addition to the PFI: AIR-TT program (this solicitation), programs within IIP and NSF that contribute to this mission include Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/bic.jsp">PFI: BIC</a>), Innovation Corps (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps">I-Corps</a><sup>TM</sup>), Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Research (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/index.jsp?SBTR=SolicAS">SBIR/STTR</a>), and Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504699&amp;SBTR=SolicAG">GOALI</a>).</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Directorate for Engineering (ENG) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) invites requests for funding under the Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Translation (PFI: AIR-TT) solicitation. This PFI: AIR-TT solicitation is designed to support innovative ideas and partnerships in the translation of NSF-funded fundamental science and engineering discoveries, or fundamental science and engineering discoveries that have been vetted through the Customer Discovery process of the National I-Corps<sup>TM </sup>program, toward market-valued solutions. The program outcomes will be more research discoveries translated onto a path toward commercial reality, more connections between faculty and persons knowledgeable about market need (e.g., potential customers, individuals with business experience, potential investors, etc.) and the engagement of faculty and students in entrepreneurial/innovative thinking.</p>
          <p>The development of basic research into deployed technology is often depicted as a sequence of steps from basic research through proof-of-concept, prototype, product development and finally commercialization. While the sequence of events may not occur in a straightforward linear fashion, the knowledge associated with each step is necessary for the transition to occur. This PFI: AIR-TT solicitation is aimed at advancing knowledge along this continuum for projects with technology innovation(s) that has already passed the basic research phase. The proposed project should be into the proof-of concept or early prototype phase with promising results and an identified potential market need or application. The proposed research should address the next stage technology/knowledge gap(s) or barrier(s) that must be solved/demonstrated as part of the path from the basic research discovery to eventual successful commercialization. The work proposed should move the technology to a higher level of maturity and readiness and result in a higher fidelity proof-of-concept or prototype/ scale-up demonstration. In other words, there should be new knowledge at the end of the award that has moved the technology closer toward commercialization.</p>
          <p>Another dimension of the path from basic discovery to successful commercialization involves an understanding of various business aspects of the innovation such as intellectual property (freedom to operate, licensing, etc.), regulatory issues, market need, etc. It is expected that the submitting team writes the proposal with an initial, basic understanding of the relevant issues as described in Section V.A.D. <em>Project Description</em>, below. The expectation is that over the course of the project, the &ldquo;participant with explicit business experience&rdquo; will lead the effort to advance the team&rsquo;s understanding of the business aspects of the project alongside the team&rsquo;s technical advances.</p>
          <p>This solicitation is not intended to fund efforts directed toward only market research or commercialization activities; the commercial development of existing products or proven concepts; straightforward engineering design for packaging; incremental existing product or process improvements; the evolutionary optimization of existing products; or evolutionary modifications to broaden the scope of an existing product or application.</p>
          <p>NSF plans to offer awardees one opportunity during the course of an award to attend a grantee meeting held in conjunction with a technology showcase to connect with potential industry collaborators and/or private-sector investors. The showcase would be an opportunity to demonstrate a prototype and/or present a poster about the work supported under the AIR award. Applicants should budget travel for the PI and one student or post-doc to attend (approximately $2,500 per person).</p>

        <p><strong>Who May Submit Proposals:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Proposals may only be submitted by the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Academic / Research Institutions; includes universities and two- and four-year colleges (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in, the US acting on behalf of their faculty members. Includes non-profit academic / research institutions.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
       
        <p><strong>Who May Serve as PI:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Lineage Requirement:</strong> <strong>There are two paths to meet the lineage requirement: through NSF-supported research results, or NSF-supported (National I-Corps<sup>TM</sup>) customer discovery results </strong></p>
          <ol>
     <li> Principal Investigator (PI) or a co-PI must have had an NSF award that ended no more than 6-years prior to the chosen submission window&rsquo;s full proposal deadline date or be a current NSF award recipient. The proposed proof-of-concept or prototype/ scale-up must be derived from the research results and/or discoveries from this underlying NSF award <strong>-OR-</strong></li><br />
       <li> The Principal Investigator (PI) or a co-PI must have graduated as part of an NSF cohort from an NSF-funded National I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> program within the past 3 years. The proposed proof-of-concept or prototype/ scale-up must be based on technology for which customer discovery activities were performed under the I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> national training.  In other words, it is <strong>not</strong> sufficient to just have had I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> training; rather the customer discovery activities performed under the NSF-funded I- Corps<sup>TM</sup> grant need to be based on the technology that is proposed to be translated within the AIR-TT proposal.   </li></ol>
          <p>Note: a proposal describing sole lineage to any of the following programs is not allowed and <strong>may be returned without review</strong>: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), PFI: AIR-TT, PFI: AIR-RA, Regional I-Corps<sup>TM</sup>, and SBIR/STTR.</p>
          <p>The PI must be a faculty member at a U.S. academic / research institution at the time of the award.</p>
          <p>In addition to the PI, there must be at least one other participant on the project (e.g., someone listed as a co-PI, Senior Personnel, Other Professional, subawardee, consultant, collaborator, etc.) with explicit business experience (for example, someone from the technology transfer office, the business school, a local/regional development office, a business entity, etc.). This person must have an active role that is explicitly described along with the specification of a time commitment on the project.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong> Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>

        </ul>
        <p>Patentable ideas, trade secrets, privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, disclosure of which may harm the proposer, should be included in proposals only when such information is necessary to convey an understanding of the proposed project. Such information must be clearly marked in the proposal and be appropriately labeled with a legend such as, "The following is (proprietary or confidential) information that (name of proposing organization) requests not be released to persons outside the Government, except for purposes of review and evaluation." The box for "Proprietary or Privileged Information" must be checked on the Cover Sheet when the proposal contains such information.</p>
        <li><strong>References Cited </strong></li>
   <p>
          Provide a comprehensive listing of relevant reference sources, including patent citations. If there are no references cited in the proposal, include a statement to that effect in this module.</p>
       <li>
          <strong>Biographical Sketches </strong></li>
   <p>
          Include short bios (two pages maximum) of the PI, co-PIs and other key personnel, including graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, if known.

All participants listed as either co-PIs or other " Senior Personnel" must submit a bio sketch of no more than two pages.</p>
        <li><strong> Budgets and Subaward budgets</strong></li>
        <p>The NSF Summary Proposal Budget is generated in FastLane or Grants.gov. Prepare a budget for each year. The system will automatically generate a cumulative budget for the entire project. A budget justification is required for each non-zero item in the budget; it should explicitly state how and where the requested funds will be spent. Note that the costs of initial patent searches and marketing studies are allowable costs.</p>
        <p>It is allowable (but not required) to expend up to 50 percent of the total budget on a subaward(s). The purpose of the proposed subaward(s) should be to augment the capabilities of the submitting academic institution. While partnerships are encouraged, bear in mind that the NSF AIR funding does not intend to support large companies' research and development activities. The need for the subaward should be clearly explained and justified in the budget justification. If a subaward is proposed to a foreign entity, clearly justify the need for the foreign entity and how their participation is essential to the success of the project.</p>
        <p>If other participating organizations are proposed and there is the possibility of joint development of intellectual property between the partners, it is the responsibility of the award recipients to discuss the appropriate intellectual property policies, including patent disclosures and filings. NSF is not responsible for the type of agreement reached between the grantee and any participating organizations/partners. Proposal partners must agree in advance of any award as to how intellectual property and publication rights will be handled. If applicable, an industry-university cooperative research agreement or university-university memorandum of understanding covering intellectual property rights including publication and patent rights must be submitted prior to an award.</p>
        <p>Submit with the proposal a letter stating that the cooperative research agreement will be provided upon recommendation of an award; see Section J. If an award is recommended, the submitting institution must follow up by providing the signed, written agreement that has been negotiated with the participating organization(s) before NSF funding will be released.</p>
        <p>If an award is recommended and there is a subaward to a company with which a PI or co-PI has a Conflict of Interest, the University must submit the conflict of interest plan for that individual covering the proposed work before NSF funding will be released.  - (The Conflict of Interest plan is not required at the proposal stage, only upon recommendation of award.)</p>
        <p>It is intended to offer awardees one opportunity during the course of the award to attend a grantee meeting held in conjunction with a technology showcase to connect with potential industry collaborators and/or private-sector investors. The showcase would be an opportunity to demonstrate a prototype and/or present a poster about the work supported under the AIR award. Applicants should budget travel to Washington, DC area for the PI and one student or post-doc to attend (approximately $2,500 per person).</p>
        <p>Funding requests will be evaluated relative to the scope and balance of the research planned.</p>
        <li><strong>Current and Pending Support</strong></li>
        <p>The proposal should provide information regarding all research to which the PI, co-PI(s) and other Senior Personnel either have committed time or have planned to commit time. If none, state NONE.</p>
        <p>For all ongoing or proposed projects, the following information should be provided for the Principal Investigators and Senior Personnel:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Name of sponsoring organization and award number;</li>
          <li>Title and performance period of the award/proposal; and</li>
          <li>Person-months/calendar months (per year) devoted to the project by the PI and each of the Senior Personnel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Current and Pending Support must be uploaded into the system. The proposal being submitted under this solicitation is considered "pending" and therefore MUST appear in the Current and Pending Support module.</p>
 <li>
          <strong>Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources</strong></li>
        <p>Discuss requirements for and the availability of facilities, equipment, and other resources required for the proposed project.</p>
        <li><strong>Supplementary Documents </strong></li>
      <p>
          Proposals missing any of these documents may be returned without review.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Milestone Chart. A milestone chart with specific tasks and deliverables.</li>
          <li>List of Prior/Current NSF Awards. Only list the prior and/or current NSF award(s) with claimed lineage to the proposed work, including an I-Corps<sup>TM</sup> award, if applicable. Note the intellectual merit, broader impacts, and publications from any listed lineage awards.</li>
          <li>Letters of Collaboration. There are two types of collaboration, one involves individuals/organizations that are included in the budget, the other involves individuals/organizations that are not included in the budget. Any substantial collaboration with individuals/organizations not included in the budget should be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2i">GPG Chapter II.C.2.i</a>).  In either case, whether or not the collaborator is included in the budget,  a letter of collaboration from each named participating organization must be provided at the time of submission of the proposal. Such letters must explicitly state the nature of the collaboration, appear on the organization's letterhead and be signed by the appropriate organizational representative.</li>
          <li>Letters of Support (limit of three letters). Letters of support are highly encouraged but not required and act as an indication of market validation for the proposed innovation. Meaningful content may demonstrate that dialog has been initiated with relevant stakeholders (potential customers, strategic partners or investors) for the proposed innovation and that the potential for a business opportunity may exist should the technology prove feasible. The letter must contain affiliation and contact information for the signatory individual.</li>
          <li>Letter of Cooperative Research Agreement. If applicable a letter stating that a CRA(s) will be provided upon recommendation of the award must be submitted with the proposal. If an award is recommended, the submitting institution must follow-up by providing a signed, written CRA(s) before NSF funding will be released.</li>
          <li>Data Management Plan. A Data Management Plan is required for all proposals submitted to NSF. Consult the data management requirements at this link: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp</a>.</li>
          <li>Postdoctoral Research Mentoring Plan. If applicable, a postdoctoral mentoring plan.</li>
          <li>Other Supplementary Docs. If applicable, letters regarding Use of Human Subjects, e.g., Institutional Review Board or IACUC approval of animal use.</li>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
     
        <p>In making the final award decisions, NSF also may consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geographic distribution and diversity of academic institutions involved in the partnership</li>
          <li>Distribution of technology or industry sectors served</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Additional Review Criteria:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The strength of the discussion of the market need and how the innovation has the potential to offer a competitive solution or competitive advantage.</li>
          <li>The merit of the research plan to translate the existing research discovery to proof-of-concept, prototype or scale-up.</li>
          <li>The demonstrated understanding of the technology barrier(s) or knowledge gap(s) and how the proof-of-concept, prototype or scale-up has the potential to overcome that gap(s).</li>
          <li>The lineage of the proposed work to the prior NSF-supported research or customer discovery results.</li>
          <li>The suitability of the proposed team to successfully complete the project.</li>
          <li>The quality of the preliminary patent search and accompanying discussion to support the feasibility of obtaining needed licenses and/or sufficient protection for intellectual property developed.</li>
          <li>The quality of the strategy for a path toward commercialization.</li>
          <li>The quality of the plan for involvement of undergraduate, graduate students and/or post-docs, incorporating an explanation of how the proposed effort will enhance their knowledge of innovation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The reasonableness of the budget and budget justification that indicate how and where the requested funds will be spent. Note, if there is a minimal research component (i.e., most of the work is to generate a business plan or to understand market need), the proposal will not be accepted.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
        <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects.

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
