          <p><strong>Revision Summary</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The number of IRES competitions and award cycles per year is reduced from two to one, but this change is not intended to reduce the size of the program.</li>
            <li>Principal Investigator and/or other U.S. administrative support salary has been added as an allowable expense, within a maximum allowable limit of $15,000 per year of the project.</li>
            <li>This solicitation specifies that all projects must be of exactly three years' duration and send no fewer than three student cohorts abroad.</li>
            <li>The maximum allowable budget per project is raised from $150,000 to $250,000 and the previous annual budget limit of $50,000 is removed entirely. Removal of the annual budget cap provides more project flexibility, but projects are still required to send a student cohort abroad in each of the three years of the project.</li>
            <li>Language has been added that student participants "must" be US Citizens or Permanent Residents.</li>
            <li>Language has been changed and/or added to strengthen the emphasis on more thorough recruitment and preparation of student participants, engagement of foreign research mentorship, high-quality research experiences coupled with appropriate support of US students in the foreign location, and post-experience follow-up for students' career enhancement and networking purposes.</li>
            <li>Explicit IRES program considerations to be used in the review and ranking of proposals have been added.</li>
            <li>The Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Program (DDEP) has been removed from this solicitation.</li>
            <li>Research Experience for Teachers (RET) has been added.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16001">NSF 16-1</a>), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 25, 2016.</p>

        <h3> 
          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Many of the world's most pressing science and engineering challenges and opportunities are trans-national in nature, and moreover, leading scientific and engineering facilities, resources, and expertise are found around the globe. In order to remain at the forefront of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the United States (U.S.) needs to nurture a globally-engaged STEM workforce capable of performing in an international research environment. To help address this need, the International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides support for U.S. students to conduct high-quality research abroad in collaboration with foreign investigators. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers.</p>
          <p>The IRES program encourages projects in any field that NSF supports. Projects must involve U.S. students conducting research at foreign sites with appropriate foreign expert mentorship.  Projects are organized and proposed by U.S. institutions and U.S.-based Principal Investigators, who arrange the specific research topics, foreign site placements, appropriate foreign research mentorship, and necessary local resources, and then recruit and prepare U.S. students to participate in these experiences. A key feature of IRES is that the primary research mentorship in-country must come from the researchers at the foreign host institution.</p>
       
       
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
         II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Because IRES requires high-quality research within the discipline of an IRES project, an IRES project will often enable students to work within an established collaboration between a U.S.-based research group and a foreign collaborating research group (for example, an existing lab-to-lab arrangement).  However, IRES projects may also be proposed by the U.S.-based PI(s) for new foreign collaborations.  </p>
          <p>In all cases, the IRES students will be recruited and prepared by the U.S. PI(s), then travel to the foreign site to conduct research under the direct supervision of the foreign research mentors. </p>
          <p>IRES proposals must have a unifying research theme that enables a &quot;cohort&quot; experience for participating students.  The IRES cohort concept requires that within each IRES project, each participating student must have an individual research project for which he/she is responsible, but these individual projects must also be coordinated to address a unifying research theme. To provide the best cohort experience, and to simplify logistical burdens, it is advised that all students supported by a given IRES project will go to the same foreign location at the same time, even though each student may have individual research project responsibility and individual foreign research mentorship.  If students are to be hosted at more than one location, it is expected that there is a common scientific theme across locations, and the proposal should include a plan for all participants to be together at one of the foreign locations at least once during the stay.</p>
          <p>IRES support is supplied for projects of three years' duration, and is expected to support three separate student cohorts during those three years.  IRES projects should give as many students as feasible, within budgetary and project constraints, the opportunity for a meaningful research experience abroad.  Projects which include fewer than four U.S. students per year, or whose annual duration of research conducted abroad is less than four weeks, should be justified by exceptional conditions or circumstances. Longer duration projects, and/or those involving more students, are generally preferable to shorter duration projects with fewer students. A typical IRES project supports 5 students per year for a summer-length research experience abroad, but the actual number of students, length of time abroad, and time of year spent abroad, may vary from IRES project to IRES project.  </p>
          <p>IRES proposals are accepted from U.S.-based academic research institutions, professional societies, or consortia. However, primary research mentorship must be provided by foreign mentors.  Nevertheless, the U.S. PI is responsible for recruiting and preparing U.S. student participants, ensuring the quality of the research experience and the appropriateness of the foreign research mentorship. It may be necessary for U.S. PIs to spend a short period of time with the U.S. students to help with the transition to the foreign site and mentors, but are not expected to remain on-site and actively engaged with the U.S. students throughout the period abroad.  </p>
          <p>Recruitment of the U.S. student participants may occur locally, or may involve wider regional or national recruitment plans.  In all cases, the proposal must clearly describe the plan for recruiting candidates, including the plan for broadening participation among underrepresented groups, and for selecting and preparing the students who will participate. IRES support must be given to students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents; the intent of the program is to broaden the international experience of US students, not to provide an additional international experience to non-U.S. students.  Preparation of selected students to enable maximum benefit during the period spent abroad is particularly important, and should include both scientific preparation for the research project as well as more general, location-specific preparation for practical and cultural issues they will encounter. </p>
          <p>Proposals should describe the research focus of the proposed activity; the intellectual collaboration with the foreign team; the plan for enhancement of students' professional networks and details on mentoring, professional development, and training that students will receive; recruitment and broadening participation plans; selection process; the pre-departure preparation of students; arrangements for housing, health insurance, and other logistics; plans for leveraging U.S. and foreign resources to strengthen the project; the plan to assess the impact of the IRES project; and strategies for disseminating project results.</p>
          <p>A good source of general information for PIs planning to take students abroad, which proposers may find valuable, is an OISE workshop report entitled 'Looking Beyond the Borders: A Project Director's Handbook of Best Practices for International Research Experiences for Undergraduates', available at:</p>

          <p>The IRES program does not support summer schools or coursework.</p>
          <p>Whereas two-way exchanges of U.S. and non-U.S. students are strongly encouraged, the IRES program can only provide support for U.S. students. Typically, the IRES program does not provide support for the foreign- research mentors. However, in certain circumstances, especially involving developing countries, it may be necessary to provide mentor support in order to make the IRES project possible.  In such cases, the proposal must clearly demonstrate such need, and also limit requested support to the minimum necessary to enable the project on behalf of the U.S. student participants. PIs considering such a proposal are strongly encouraged to consult with the IRES program officer prior to submission.</p>
          <p>PIs are responsible for obtaining required visas for foreign travel. PIs are also responsible for obtaining research permits and import/export documents, where necessary. </p>
          <p><em>Research Experiences for Teachers</em></p>
          <p>NSF encourages research experiences for K-12 teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and the coordination of these experiences with IRES projects. Most directorates support Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) as a formal activity and announce their specific interests (e.g. RET Sites, RET Supplements) either in solicitations, in &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letters, or on directorate/division websites.  Other NSF units have no formal announcement but respond to requests for RET support on a case-by-case basis.  Teachers may also be included in an IRES project.  Applicants who wish to include an RET in an IRES proposal should contact the IRES program officer for guidance.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Budgetary Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
        <p>Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.</p>
   
        <p><strong>Indirect Cost (F&amp;A) Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>Indirect costs are allowable, consistent with NSF's general policy.  Student stipends, travel, and subsistence costs for this training experience are typically listed as participant support costs and as such are not subject to indirect costs.  Off-campus indirect rates are applicable to activities at foreign sites.</p>
   
        <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>IRES projects have duration of three years, and a maximum total budget of $250,000.</p>
        <p>In most instances, the majority of IRES funding is expected to be in direct participant support costs (student stipends, travel, and living expenses at the foreign-research site). Other allowable budget items include: modest expenses for materials, supplies, publication costs, etc., in support of U.S. student research; support for short-term visits of the U.S.-based PI to establish and manage the project; up to $15,000 in salary support for the U.S. PI and/or other U.S. administrative staff directly involved with student support, per year; and reasonable costs in support of project assessment.</p>
        <p>Student stipends should be provided for all participants, and should be comparable to similar NSF-sponsored research opportunities such as EAPSI and REU (approximately $500 per student per week).  The stipend should be provided in addition to actual travel and living expenses. The intention of this requirement is to eliminate economic need as a barrier to student participation.</p>
        <p>In most cases, foreign mentors may not be supported by funds from the IRES program. However, when foreign mentors are from a developing country, some support may be provided for the foreign participation. Applicants should discuss specifics with the IRES program officer before submitting a proposal, and any requests for such funding must clearly establish that such funding is necessary in order for the project to proceed, and that all such funding is for activities in direct support of the US-based student participants.  Any support provided to foreign mentors or their labs must be identified on Line G6 &quot;Other&quot; on the Proposal Budget form.  Subawards are not permitted.  IRES funds may not be used to support foreign student participation.</p>
        <p>For living expenses abroad, applicants are encouraged to work with foreign counterparts to develop realistic budget requests.  For example, access to university guest housing or similar facilities should be explored.  In no case should the amount for lodging and meals and incidental expenses (MI&amp;E) exceed the <a href="http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/prdm/">authorized U.S. Government per diem rates</a>, calculated at the daily rate for the first 30 days of a single project visit, and 50 percent of that rate for all time after that.  Various approaches to cost-effective, reciprocal arrangements can be considered.  All travel must comply with current travel guidelines (please see Article 14 of the Agency Specific Requirements to the Research Terms and Conditions <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/rtc/nsf_212.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/rtc/nsf_212.pdf</a>).</p>
        <p>Some disciplinary REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) programs hold a PI meeting.  IRES PIs should plan on attending an REU PI meeting organized by their NSF disciplinary program, if applicable.  The meetings are held in the U.S. and the budget should include the appropriate travel costs.   </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
         <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
 
        <p>In addition to the general NSF review criteria described above, the following criteria will be used in evaluating proposals submitted in response to this solicitation:</p>
        <ol>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p> Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

       <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
        <h4> 
          A. Notification of the Award
        </h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
       <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
