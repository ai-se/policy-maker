<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program was conceived in 2007 to design, explore, and show proof of concept at scale of computer
networking architectures that could meet the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century as well as educate a cadre of large-scale network
architects. The program was envisioned as being comprised of three phases. The first phase was part of the Networking Technology and Systems
(NeTS) program within the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS), which solicited Future Internet Design (FIND) projects and awarded
proposals that pursued innovative network architectural components that were not constrained by the current Internet. In 2010, a FIA
solicitation through the cross-directorate Network Science and Engineering (NetSE) program funded projects that sought to design and develop
integrated trustworthy architectures that had similar scope to the current Internet, but were not constrained by the Internet's existing
design or deployment. This solicitation is for the third phase, termed FIA Next Phase (FIA-NP), of CISE's commitment to fostering
innovative, large-scale, trustworthy computer network architectures. FIA-NP seeks to move currently funded FIA projects from design with
integrated working code to proof of concept at reasonable scale within challenging and realistic environments.</p>

<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Over the past 7 years, the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) has invested in fundamental research
that will lead to trustworthy computer network architectures that will meet the needs of the twenty-first century. CISE is issuing this
solicitation to support research that builds upon its current investments in Future Internet Architectures (FIA). Proposals are expected to
specify research activities that will take existing FIA designs from basic components that have been integrated into early prototypes that
demonstrate architectural principles and requirements to more sophisticated architectures with demonstrated prototype systems. The
architectures will be tested and evaluated via the prototypes in one or more relevant environments. The proposed projects should continue to
take into consideration the larger societal, economic and legal issues that arise from the interplay between the Internet and
society.</p><p>The research team conducting the work articulated in the proposal should include individuals with expertise in a range of
relevant disciplines and/or in using different research methods and must include at least one expert in network security. A project should
include subject area experts in the environments in which the architecture will be tested. The project team is also encouraged to include
experts in social, economic and legal issues such as, but not limited to, experts in values in design. The team should include researchers
with the range of necessary expertise, but no more than appropriate for the completion of the project.</p>

submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. Chapter II, Section D.4 of the Grant Proposal Guide
provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p><p><strong>Important Proposal Preparation Information: </strong>FastLane will
check for required sections of the proposal, in accordance with <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG) instructions described in Chapter
II.C.2. The GPG requires submission of: Project Summary; Project Description; References Cited; Biographical Sketch(es); Budget; Budget
Justification; Current and Pending Support; Facilities, Equipment &amp; Other Resources; Data Management Plan; and Postdoctoral Mentoring
Plan, if applicable. If a required section is missing, <strong>FastLane will not accept the proposal. </strong></p><p>Please note that the
proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions. If the solicitation
instructions do not require a GPG-required section to be included in the proposal, insert text or upload a document in that section of the
proposal that states, &quot;Not Applicable for this Program Solicitation.&quot; Doing so will enable FastLane to accept your
proposal.</p><p><strong>In addition to the guidelines in the GPG or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide, proposal preparation instructions
specific to the preparation of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are provided below:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cover
Sheet.</strong> For management purposes, all proposal titles should begin with the FIA-NP acronym. For proposals coming from a single
institution, the FIA-NP acronym should be directly followed by the project title (i.e., <strong>FIA-NP: Project Title</strong>). If the
proposal is part of a set of collaborative proposals, the FIA acronym should be followed by a colon, then by the words &quot;Collaborative
Research&quot; followed by a colon, and then the title (i.e., <strong>FIA-NP: Collaborative Research:
Title).</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Project Summary.</strong> The proposal must contain a summary of the proposed activity suitable
for publication. The summary must not exceed one page and should be informative to other persons working in the same or related fields.
</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Project Description.</strong> The Project Description is limited to 25 pages, and must include the
following topics: <ul><li><em>Vision</em>: describe a well-articulated &quot;vision&quot; of the proposed comprehensive architecture, its
high-level objectives, and its motivating ideas. </li><li><em>Architecture</em>: describe the underlying architecture design and summarize
what has already been developed at the time of the proposal submission, including how the design requirements (such as trustworthiness),
invariants and components are synthesized into a coherent comprehensive architecture. This section should also include the current status of
developed prototypes.</li><li><em>Research Agenda</em>: define a coherent research agenda focused on principled design by describing how the
proposed work will extend and evaluate the proposed architecture and will result in a stable prototype of a complete system applied to one
or more realistic network environments; include a description of future security/trustworthiness research as well as research in considering
the relevant larger social, economic and/or legal challenges facing the architecture.</li><li><em>Network</em> <em>Environments:</em>
include and describe at least one and preferably two relevant and realistic environments that will be used to inform, test and demonstrate
the overall architecture's feasibility and value of the architecture in realistic settings. Examples of environments might include: an
enterprise with special network requirements; a critical infrastructure; a content delivery network with embedded clouds; a civil crisis or
public safety network; a complex network of things; interconnected cyber-physical systems; or the public Internet (i.e., the architecture is
designed to run in parallel with, or instead of, the current Internet).</li><li><em>Evaluation Plan:</em> include an evaluation plan that
specifies criteria or metrics relevant to the scientific and engineering goals of the project, and that gives a description of how the
evaluation will be conducted. The evaluation plan should include an assessment of trustworthiness and an analysis of how well the
architecture performs against the relevant criteria or metrics. The evaluation may require the construction of new artifacts or the use of
research infrastructures like <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.geni.net/">GENI</a> (Global Environment for Network Innovations) or other test and
evaluation facilities.</li><li><em>Education and Outreach</em>: describe plans to integrate education and research focused on exploring
architectural design and understanding of large-scale systems. Discuss plans to stimulate interest in architectures and networked systems in
undergraduate and graduate education and/or to foster innovation by students using prototype platforms on campus, and describe one or more
outreach activities. </li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong><em>Please note that per guidance in the GPG, the Project Description must
contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. You can decide where to
include this section within the project description.</em></strong></p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Budget</strong>: Provide a detailed
budget for each year of the project. FastLane or Grants.gov will automatically generate a cumulative budget. The budget should include funds

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES  </h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review.
All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten
other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by
the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to
suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the
proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of
such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition,
Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review
recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the
GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p><p>A comprehensive description of
the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>.</p><p>Proposers should also be
aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF
Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process,
of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and
broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities. </p><p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to
foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research
institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers,
educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich
research through the variety of learning perspectives. </p><p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities
and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is
essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the
programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables
breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support,
NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential
to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and
welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit
review process for the selection of projects. </p><p>1. Merit Review Principles</p><p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs
and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program
staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal
agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles
apply:</p><ul><li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of
knowledge.<br /> </li><li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader
Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or
through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously
established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br /> </li><li>Meaningful assessment and
evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of
broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in
isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more
aggregated, level than the individual project. </li></ul><p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts
outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities
described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that
the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p><p>These three merit review principles provide the
basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their
intent.</p><p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit
review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
programs and activities.</p><p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full
consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.
Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG
Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the
proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a
proposal.</p><p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it,
how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply
both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will
be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion
encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br /> </li><li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion
encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li></ul><p>The
following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p><ol><li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to <ol
type="a"><li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li><li>Benefit
society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li></ol></li><li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and
explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li><li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities
well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li><li>How well
qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li><li>Are there adequate resources available to
the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li></ol><p>Broader impacts may be
accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through
activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities
that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women,
persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM
education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology;
improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between
academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced
infrastructure for research and education. </p><p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management
Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p><p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review
Criteria</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the merit review principles and criteria described above, FIA-NP proposals will also be evaluated by the extent to which
the:</p><ul><li>Current Future Internet Architecture that forms the basis for the proposed work includes basic components, which are
implemented in code or hardware, and which work together to demonstrate a prototype of a comprehensive internet
architecture.</li><li>Proposed Future Internet Architecture has a solid security design supported by prototype
implementation.</li><li>Research agenda and an associated coordination and management plan provide confidence that the project will advance
the architecture and implementation to a system prototype demonstration in one or more relevant environments.</li><li>Targeted environments
are realistic and are sufficiently important or critical so that the architecture tested and evaluated on them will show promise for a
future viable deployment at a large scale.</li><li>Evaluation plans and the metrics described in the proposal are well developed and
appropriate to determine systematically the value and significance of the Future Internet Architecture at least within the chosen
environment(s). </li><li>Architecture takes into consideration the relevant larger societal, economic and/or legal issues that arise from
the interplay between the Future Internet Architecture and society.</li></ul></p>

<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.
</p>
<p>
<p>Reverse Site Visits will be used as needed. </p>
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage
the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the
cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants
whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target
date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as
confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project
Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of
Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other
agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or
authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF
Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or
cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.
Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program.
Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See
Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>

<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise
communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the
applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other
NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF

<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project
report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require
submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final
project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports,
or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for
all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of
required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and
submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and
organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes
certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and
submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the
project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF
Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp;

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended
(42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health,
prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and
education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges,
universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The
Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately
55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the
Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but
does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The
Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and
engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with
Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects.
See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National
Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable
individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act
of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project
reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information
requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer
institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to
government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government
agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order
to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the
government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal
File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated
Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete
information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for
this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments
regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,
