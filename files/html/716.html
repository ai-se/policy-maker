<a name="pgm_synp_txt" id="pgm_synp_txt"></a>
<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Software is a critical element in a broad range of real-world systems ranging from micro- and nano-scale embedded devices in highways, household appliances, and medical devices to continental- and global-scale critical infrastructures, such as communications and electrical power grids and transportation, health care, and enterprise systems. While software&rsquo;s role in governing overall system behavior can ultimately determine success or failure, the science and engineering of designing and building software for real-world systems remain elusive and poorly understood.</p>
  <p>The Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) is calling for researchers to discover, define, and apply new scientific principles, engineering processes and methods, and educational pedagogy to the design, development, and use of software for real-world systems. The Software for Real-World Systems (SRS) Program specifically intends to bridge and transcend CISE disciplines by encouraging collaborations that might include any of the sub-disciplines of computer and information science and engineering (e.g., a new logic for reasoning about software systems complexity) to answer the question: <strong>How can software for real-world systems be designed, built, and analyzed in elegant and powerful new ways?</strong>&nbsp; Collaborative
    activities that include researchers from both the foundations of software
    (including for example, programming languages, formal methods, and software
    engineering) community and the computer and network systems community are
    encouraged. </p>
  <p>Bold rethinking of the science and engineering of software for real-world systems &ndash; from the basic concepts of design, evolution, and adaptation to the integration of human capabilities &ndash; is needed. &nbsp;Emerging technologies, such as multicore processors and pervasive computing, heighten the urgency for new thinking as we build software for future systems. &nbsp;SRS is looking for multi-investigator teams or single investigators who will integrate diverse ideas and novel approaches in the design, development, and use of software for real-world systems.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Software plays a critical role in a broad range of real-world systems that are pervasive and integral to our lives, ranging from the smallest micro- and nano-scale embedded devices to continental- and global-scale critical infrastructures, such as communications and electric power grids and transportation, health care, and enterprise systems. The types of real-world systems that are the focus of this solicitation include cyber-physical systems (e.g., clinical medical devices, sensors embedded in cars, highways, and bridges), networked systems (e.g., the Internet, banking and financial systems), mobile and ubiquitous systems (e.g., wireless systems, networks of &ldquo;things that think&rdquo;), along with other software-intensive systems. Future real-world systems will incorporate emerging technologies, such as multicore processors, which introduce new and different fundamental challenges for software development. While software may be only one component in such systems, it plays a critical role in system stability (or cascading failures), technological innovation (or stagnation), and system success (or failure). Yet, the science and engineering of designing and building the software that will govern the essential behaviors and properties of real-world systems remain elusive and poorly understood.</p>
<p>As real-world systems grow in number, size, complexity, and importance, it becomes increasingly clear that researchers in the sub-disciplines of computer and information science and engineering need to collaborate to rethink the scientific principles, engineering processes and methods, and educational pedagogy that underlie these systems.  </p>
<p><a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a></p>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Software systems and technologies have become a cornerstone of the world economy, fueling organizational productivity and industrial growth. Yet we know that current software technologies have limited security, reliability, and functionality, and that they are not always dependable, which can introduce risks in critical life or death situations. As software-intensive systems become increasingly ubiquitous in our lives, they also become more heterogeneous, decentralized, indeterminate, dynamic, and participatory, demanding increasingly sophisticated control mechanisms and sufficient intelligence to adapt, learn, and reason about the unstructured and uncertain environments in which they operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The engineering of software for real-world systems needs new processes and
  methods based on new scientific principles. This solicitation seeks answers
  to the question: <strong>How can software for real-world systems be designed,
  built, and analyzed in elegant and powerful new ways?</strong> A bold rethinking
  of the fundamentals of software design and evolution as well as new approaches
  to system adaptation in uncertain human, natural, and man-made environments
  is needed.</p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
  <li><strong> Real-World Challenges</strong>  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Software for Real-World Systems (SRS) Program calls on researchers to
    develop new scientific principles, engineering processes and methods, and
    educational pedagogy for the challenges inherent in such systems. SRS encourages
    multi-investigator and/or single investigator projects that integrate diverse
    ideas and novel approaches to produce new knowledge and technologies that
    address the challenges outlined below.&nbsp; Collaborative activities that
    include researchers from both the foundations of software (including for
    example, programming languages, formal methods, and software engineering)
    community and the computer and network systems community are encouraged.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Recognizing that the challenges described below are interdependent and have overlapping dimensions, successful projects will promise innovations and paradigm shifts in at least two of the following three areas.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><em> Design and evolution of large-scale, real-world systems with scalable,
        computational methods of composition.</em></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>SRS encourages research projects that develop new scientific principles and engineering processes in support of the design and evolution of real-world systems that can expand to arbitrary size and complexity and that support human intellectual control during development and operation. Considerations of scale, control, and modularity demand that systems be assembled out of components, services, and coordination mechanisms as structured by overarching system architectures. Emerging technologies add new layers of design complexity. For example, the use of multicore processors will require new principles and methods for analyzing, designing, and coordinating parallel processing threads and information streams in a system architecture. <strong>What scientific principles are needed to support engineering processes and methods for scalable, computational composition of human, software, and platform components in order to understand and analyze resulting behaviors and dynamic properties?</strong></p>
    <p>As disparate components are composed into systems, notions of behavioral
      correctness among the components must be reconciled and the resulting correctness
      of the composed system&rsquo;s behavior calculated.&nbsp; <strong>What scientific principles are needed to move the field beyond current conceptions and calculations of correctness?</strong></p>
    <p>New principles and methods for designing software to acquire, organize, analyze, and distribute information in real-world systems are desired. The development of sophisticated interfaces, powerful data manipulation languages, and innovative data analytic methods will provide the capability to build effective real-world systems that can manage large information requirements. <strong>How can software for data-intensive systems be designed to cope with enormous amounts of data and to transform that data into useful, actionable information and knowledge?</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><em> Monitoring, orchestration, and control of real-world system behaviors
      and interactions in dynamic, ever-changing conditions and operational
      environments.</em> </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The second challenge focuses on the dynamic properties of software components, such as performance, reliability, security, and usability, and how they are represented and analyzed as computable features of composed systems, particularly during operation. <strong>How can real-world systems be designed to identify, understand, manage, and potentially optimize their emergent behaviors and dynamic properties during operation?</strong> Since it is impossible to specify or predict a priori all of the behaviors or dynamic properties of a real-world system while it is operating, unknown, emergent behaviors and properties may result. Thus, methods and principles for dynamic adaptability must be discovered and applied to manage the adaptation of the system as it responds to its environment and transaction load. The flexible nature of software and its inherent malleability provide the potential for systems to adapt autonomically (e.g., self-diagnosing, self-configuring, or self-repairing) to environmental conditions. <strong>What
        scientific principles and engineering processes and methods are needed
        to support the autonomic performance of a real-world system in response
        to its dynamic, ever-changing conditions and operational environment? &nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>This challenge requires system-level orchestration and control that spans
      many potential interfaces and interactions with hardware platforms, data,
      other software components, and people.&nbsp; <strong>How can critical interactions within and among real-world systems and between systems and humans be 1) detected and limited or 2) enabled and controlled, as the situation requires?</strong></p>
    <p>Systems software that provides principled services and architectures is
      needed to enable and provide a suitable basis for certifiably dependable
      systems. Traditional fixed points such as the boundaries that divide operating
      systems and middleware may need to be reexamined for varied, dynamic, and
      interacting systems. Future applications will place extreme demands on
      systems that are time-critical or require dynamic resource allocation,
      low latency, or low jitter. Service architectures will need to support
      higher-level abstractions&nbsp; (e.g.,
      for sensing, communication, coordination, prediction, and control) and
      varied and perhaps changing aggregations of interacting systems. <strong>What scientific principles and engineering methods of analysis and certification are required to achieve system architectures and mechanisms whose composite properties and behaviors are certifiably dependable?</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  <ol start="3" type="1">
    <li><em> Amplification of human participation in the design and use of real-world
      systems.</em> </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The third challenge includes people and human factors in the design of
      software for real-world systems. People are key participants in most real-world
      systems, serving as users, software developers, and maintainers.&nbsp; Despite
      their importance, human-centered design of real-world systems is not routine.&nbsp; <strong>How can software for real-world systems be designed where interactions with people are at the core of the systems design?</strong>&nbsp; We
      live in a world increasingly defined by software. SRS seeks projects that
      will produce new knowledge about how to guide the evolution of this software-defined
      world so that human values are embedded in it, optimal experiences are
      achieved, and all of society benefits.<strong>&nbsp; What knowledge and
      tools are needed for people to participate fully in the design, development,
      and use of real-world systems as end-users, programmers, and stakeholders?</strong></p>
    <p>Another important component of this challenge is how best to harness collective
      intelligence and human ingenuity in the design and development of software
      for real-world systems.&nbsp; Participatory computing and open source software
      (OSS) development provide rich opportunities for user-centered innovations
      in future systems. <strong>What scientific principles and engineering processes methods are needed to support effective software design collaborations among many, widely distributed contributors?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Can the principles and engineering methods of OSS be discovered and extended to a fuller range of participatory computing approaches?</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="A">
  <li><strong> Innovations and Paradigm Shifts in Fundamental Principles, Engineering
    Processes, and Education Pedagogy</strong> </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>In responding to the challenges of designing and building software for real-world
    systems outlined in (A) above, projects must pay attention to innovations
    and paradigm shifts in the scientific principles, engineering processes and
    methods, and/or educational pedagogy of software for real-world systems.
    Each project should innovate in at least two of the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><em>Scientific Principles</em>: SRS calls for a fresh look at the question: <strong>What are the scientific principles for creating and analyzing software for real-world systems?</strong>&nbsp; The
        Program seeks to uncover fundamental concepts and principles for the
        development of software as have been found in other sciences such as
        physics and chemistry. Transformative theories, models, logics, languages,
        and algorithms are sought. For example, the use of current software development
        principles of modularity and abstraction levels provide clear benefits
        for software understandability, reuse, and modifiability. <strong>In a world of dynamic operational environments and real-time adaptability, do we need new understandings of long-proven software development principles or do we need new principles altogether?</strong></p>
    </li>
        </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><em>Engineering Processes and Methods</em>: <strong>What are the most
          effective engineering processes and methods for designing, building,
          and analyzing software for real-world systems?</strong> The SRS Program
          calls for innovative methods, techniques, processes, architectures,
          tools, and testbeds. For example, engineering methods of incremental
          development and rapid prototyping have been shown to be effective for
          the development of many existing software systems. <strong>Will
          such methods still be effective in development environments that are
          dynamic, decentralized, and where system components are heterogeneous
          and under the control of other parties?&nbsp; What new engineering
          methods of system certification are needed in such environments?
      </strong></p>
    </li>
            <li><em>Educational Pedagogy:</em> Regardless of their complex functionality and dynamic properties, software systems must still be easy to understand, use, maintain, and modify. An important goal of the SRS Program is to support innovative pedagogy for educating students and training the U.S. workforce on the new ideas produced by the funded research projects. <strong>What new educational ideas and activities are needed to support the learning and application of scientific principles and engineering methods for the design, construction, and analysis of software for real-world systems?</strong></li>
        </ul>
  <p><strong>Relation to Other Programs</strong></p>
  <p>Research on software for real-world systems is an active concern in other NSF programs. Submissions to the SRS Program must have a clear focus on basic research to advance the <em>science and engineering of software for real-world systems</em>. Projects outside of this focus can be submitted to related NSF programs, including the following programs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Computing Processes and Artifacts (CPA) cluster within the CCF Division
        supports research projects where the focus is on particular core software
        engineering topics such as programming languages and software testing.</p>
    </li>
            <li>
              <p>The
                Computer Systems Research (CSR) program within the CNS Division
                supports a range of computer systems research topics including
                cyber-physical systems, dynamic data driven applications systems,
              and cross systems integration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The Information and Intelligent
                Systems (IIS) Division supports research that: addresses systems
                in which humans, whether as individuals, teams, organizations,
                or societies, assume participatory and integral roles throughout
                all stages of systems development and use; and, develops new
                knowledge about computational understanding and modeling of the
                many human and animal capabilities that demonstrate intelligence
              and adaptability in unstructured and uncertain environments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The
                CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education
                (CPATH) program supports projects to transform undergraduate
                computing education on a national scale to meet the challenges
                and opportunities of a world where computing is essential to
                U.S. leadership and economic competitiveness across all sectors
              of society.</p>
            </li>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
  (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
  of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
  criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
  and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to
    advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different
    fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct
    the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the
    prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore
    creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
    activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How
    well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports
    at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities
    where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators,
    and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education
    with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
    learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating
    Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
    is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is
    committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Innovations and Paradigm Shifts &ndash;</strong> SRS proposals must describe how the project will provide innovations and paradigm shifts in <strong>at least</strong> two of the three areas of <em>scientific principles</em>, <em>engineering processes and methods</em>, and <em>educational pedagogy</em> to address the challenges of designing, building, and analyzing software for real-world systems. The &ldquo;Project Summary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Project Description&rdquo; sections of the proposal must explicitly articulate the expected research contributions to be made in two (or three) of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Plan &ndash;</strong> For multi-investigator projects, a &ldquo;Collaboration Plan&rdquo; is required and should provide detailed information about the roles of key project personnel and the plans for coordinating project tasks among multiple individuals, institutions and disciplines, as applicable. The Collaboration Plan will be reviewed for clarity of task definitions, effectiveness of task assignments, and achievability of project objectives.</p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or
  decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's
  review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important
  information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration
  Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a></p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available
  through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project
  reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
  project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other
  specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter
  information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
  using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes
  certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
