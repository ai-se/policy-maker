      <div class="user_input">
        <p class="MsoNormal">The Digital Library for Earth System Education (<a href="http://www.dlese.org/">DLESE</a>) 
          is a distributed, community-based electronic library dedicated to improving 
          the quality, quantity, and efficiency of teaching and learning about 
          the Earth system at all educational levels.&#160; It capitalizes on 
          developments in modern information technology to make full use of, and 
          bring order to, the World Wide Web for the purpose of empowering any 
          teacher, learner, or citizen seeking to understand the Earth system 
          to easily discover the right educational materials for their purposes 
          and be assured of their high quality.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">DLESE is a product of the wide recognition of the 
          need for improved science education across the national, state, and 
          local levels and greater access to quality science education for all.&#160; 
          Emerging information and communications technologies present a means 
          of maximizing investments in science education by providing the necessary 
          integration services and community support to promote synergy across 
          otherwise disparate projects.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Five operational service areas of DLESE have been 
          established to work in an integrated fashion to assist individuals and 
          groups in developing high-quality digital resources suitable for accession 
          into the library, to use the library&#8217;s resources to deliver high-quality 
          geoscience education at any level, and to provide a forum for community 
          dialog on best practices.&#160; The five service areas constitute what 
          is known as the DLESE Core.&#160; These five core service areas are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Collections Services</strong>:&#160; 
              Extensive outreach to individuals and institutions to identify and 
              enable the accession of high-quality Earth system resources into 
              the library and to facilitate the early establishment of a rigorous 
              peer-review system.&#160; The system enables multiple pathways to 
              a reviewed DLESE collection.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Community Services</strong>:&#160; 
              Extensive outreach to individuals and institutions to facilitate 
              the use of and contributions to the library, to enable community 
              interaction via the library, and to nurture the use of best practices 
              to enable learning about the Earth system.&#160;</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Data Services</strong>:&#160; Engagement 
              in projects involving the development and use of tools to facilitate 
              access via DLESE to Earth system data sets residing on remote servers, 
              promote exemplary use of data in educational applications, and organize 
              interaction between data providers and data users.&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Evaluation Services</strong>:&#160; 
              Ongoing monitoring of efficacy of use of DLESE&#160;collections 
              and their&#160;value in substantively improving learning about the 
              Earth system.</div>

              and services to act as an integrated whole.&#160; Provides interoperability 
              services within the DLESE network and with other library and information 
              service providers. Provides tools, components and services that 
              enable the development of high-quality educational collections and 
              resources. Supports community governance.</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The current structure of DLESE operations is the 
          result of extensive deliberations within and a resulting recommendation 
          by the&#160;<a href="http://www.dlese.org/people/steering.html">DLESE 
          Steering Committee</a>, which has the responsibility for developing 
          policies that guide the development of DLESE and for overseeing DLESE 
          operations on behalf of the broader geoscience community.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">All the groups staffing the core service areas are 
          party to the DLESE Core Integrated Work Plan (IWP), which describes 
          the responsibilities of each service group and identifies specific tasks 
          where collaboration among multiple service areas must occur.&#160; The 
          purpose of the IWP is to define tasks and milestones in order to effectively 
          meet the overarching goals articulated in the&#160;<a href="http://www.dlese.org/documents/plans/stratplanver12.html">DLESE 
          Strategic Plan</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Enable the library to serve as a catalyst for 
              geoscience educational reform,</div>
          </li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Establish DLESE as the premier, trusted source 
            for high quality geoscience educational resources, and</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal">Promote sustainable library growth through community 
            capacity-building and community participation in library governance, 
            development, and operations.&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The leaders of each Core Service Group, along with 
          other select individuals representing key sectors of DLESE, serve on 
          the Management Council, the purpose of which is to plan and coordinate 
          operational activities in the context of the Integrated Work Plan.&#160; 
          An Executive Director heads the Management Council.&#160; The current 
          Executive Director is serving on an interim basis.&#160; A Letter of 
          Agreement&#160; articulates the collaborative spirit in which the Management 
          Council operates.&#160; The Management Council reports via the Executive 
          Director to the&#160;<a href="http://www.dlese.org/people/steering.html">DLESE 
          Steering Committee</a>.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">DLESE has grown rapidly in complexity, and can be 
          expected to continue to do so.&#160; The continued success of DLESE 
          will require effective management of its operations, and there is a 
          consensus that this can best be accomplished by the establishment of 
          a DLESE Project Office analogous to project offices serving other NSF-supported 
          facilities.</p>
      </div>
      <a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a> <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p class="MsoNormal">NSF invites proposals seeking to establish a DLESE 
          Project Office.&#160; The competition is open to all of the categories 
          of proposers identified in the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) who are eligible 
          to submit proposals to NSF. The project office will be responsible for 
          leading community discussions surrounding the growth of the DLESE digital 
          collection.&#160; In parallel, the office will be responsible for coordinating 
          the development of the array of services that will support the creation 
          of exemplary resources and their use in enhancing geoscience education.&#160; 
          Finally, the office will have an important ongoing role in leading the 
          community-building activities of the core service groups.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The Principal Investigator of the successful proposal 
          will become the Executive Director of the DLESE Management Council.&#160; 
          This individual must&#160;effectively coordinate the work of an exceedingly 
          competent and diverse core service team, lead the integration of the 
          core service activities, and serve the necessary role of leadership 
          and focal point for the DLESE enterprise through a period of change 
          in response to the evolution in technology, the National Science Digital 
          Library, and the education milieu. This will ideally be someone who 
          comes from a geoscientific research background, but who has established 
          credentials in geoscience education, and thus will know and be well-known 
          by both the research and education communities.&#160;&#160;The individual 
          will operate a small project office at his/her home institution, and 
          will devote at least half-time to leading DLESE operations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The Executive Director will facilitate coordinated 
          action by the Core Services groups on a broad array of activities needed 
          to support community use of and contribution to the library, and participation 
          in the development of the library as a community-based effort.&#160; 
          Among the ongoing challenges are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Working with developers of thematic collections 
              to ensure that they are ultimately accessioned into the library 
              in a high-quality, readily usable form.</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Creating mechanisms for routinely obtaining 
              feedback from the community, especially via the DLESE Annual meeting, 
              and distilling this information into action by the Core Services 
              groups in a timely manner.</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Developing a cadre of DLESE ambassadors who 
              can develop local support for users, making effective use of existing 
              networks.</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Creating partnerships between DLESE and large-scale 
              resource developers, such as government agencies and university 
              consortia, so that resources are crafted from the beginning in a 
              form appropriate for a digital library.</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="MsoNormal">Establishing a robust outreach program that

          desirable to support a new type of management structure.&#160; For example, 
          the Steering Committee has discussed the option of placing DLESE operations 
          within a corporate structure analogous to that of certain other NSF-supported 
          facilities.&#160; During the award period, there will be ongoing discussions 
          within the Steering Committee, supported by the Management Council, 
          and within the broader community of the approach that seems optimal 
          for DLESE.&#160; It is expected that the Executive Director will have 
          an important role in helping to frame this discussion.&#160;</p>

      <a name="review"></a> <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a> <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited 
        from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research 
        or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers 
        charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer 
        to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate 
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with 
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic 
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to 
        that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals 
        at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB 
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit 
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional 
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs 
        and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important 
        Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements 
        Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces 
        the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review 
        of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal 
        processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed 
        when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines 
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. 
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must 
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page 
        Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting 
        from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description 
        and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that 
        do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project 
        Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation 
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance 
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed 
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant 
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria 
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are 
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers 
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address 
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered 
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is 
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, 
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent 
        does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? 
        How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient 
        access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting 
        teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity 
        broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, 
        disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure 
        for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, 
        and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance 
        scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of 
        the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making 
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster 
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects, 
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These 
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently 
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where 
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement 
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens 
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities 
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. 
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to 
        the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      <a name="reviewprot"></a> 
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer 
        Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons 
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the 
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation 
        will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Ad Hoc 
        and/or panel review. </p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support 
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
        review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted 
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. 
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are 
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. 
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision 
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals 
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time 
        interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation, or 
        the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends when 
        the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and 
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications 
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers 
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, 
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of 
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical 
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator 
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence 
        of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements 
        Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), 
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer 
        at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a> <p> Within 90 days after the expiration 
        of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final project report. 
        Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing 
        of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the 
        formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required 
        data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available 
        through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project 
        reports. This system permits electronic submission and updating of project 
        reports, including information on project participants (individual and 
        organizational), activities and findings, publications, and other specific 
        products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information 
        previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using 
        the electronic system. </p>

      <p> The NSF <i>Guide to Programs</i> is a compilation of funding for research 
        and education in science, mathematics, and engineering. The NSF <i>Guide 
        to Programs</i> is available electronically at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gp">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gp</a>. 
        General descriptions of NSF programs, research areas, and eligibility 
        information for proposal submission are provided in each chapter. </p>
      <p> Many NSF programs offer announcements or solicitations concerning specific 
        proposal requirements. To obtain additional information about these requirements, 
        contact the appropriate NSF program offices. Any changes in NSF's fiscal 
        year programs occurring after press time for the <i>Guide to Programs</i> 
        will be announced in the NSF <a 
  href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin">E-Bulletin</a>, which is updated daily 
        on the NSF Website at <a   href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin">https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin</a>, 
        and in individual program announcements/solicitations. Subscribers can 
        also sign up for NSF's <a

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in 
        most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible 
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for 
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such 
        findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and 
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons 
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with 
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of 
        race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded 
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination 
        under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from NSF, 
        although some programs may have special requirements that limit eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> 
        (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
        persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student 
        research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter 
        II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types 
        of proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited 
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection 
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted by 
        awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the 
        Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed 
        to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review 
        process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data 
        regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration 
        of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers 
        and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government 
        agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order 
        to coordinate programs; and to another Federal agency, court or party 
        in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a 
        party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer 
        file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers 
        or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, "Principal 
        Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 
        267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated 
        Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998). Submission of the 
        information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, 
        however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control 
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public 
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. 
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of this 
        collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, 
        to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of Administrative 
        Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
