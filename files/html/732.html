<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation continues the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program into its tenth annual competition. Proposals for new IGERT projects as well as for renewals of existing IGERT projects are invited. The IGERT program has been developed to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers who will pursue careers in research and education with the interdisciplinary backgrounds, deep knowledge in chosen disciplines, and technical, professional, and personal skills to become, in their own careers, leaders and creative agents for change. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education, for students, faculty, and institutions, by establishing innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is also intended to contribute to a world-class, broadly inclusive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce.</p>
<p>IGERT is an NSF-wide endeavor involving the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), the Office of Polar Programs (OPP), the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA), the Office of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI), and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). The IGERT program is managed by the Division of Graduate Education in EHR.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Proposals submitted to the IGERT program must describe integrative, research-based, graduate education and training activities in emerging areas of science and engineering. The IGERT project should be organized around an interdisciplinary theme involving a diverse group of faculty members and other investigators with appropriate expertise in research and teaching. The interdisciplinary theme provides a framework for integrating research and education and for promoting collaborative efforts within and across departments and institutions. Students should gain the breadth of skills, strengths, and understanding to work in an interdisciplinary environment while being well grounded with depth of knowledge in a major field. As an opportunity for faculty to experiment with new approaches to graduate education, the IGERT project should provide students with experience relevant to both academic and nonacademic careers. This may involve such activities as internships and mentoring in industrial, national laboratory, academic, or other settings. Globalization of research and career opportunities places importance on providing students with an international perspective. This may be gained through programs within the institution, or through strongly integrated, collaborative research experiences and/or fieldwork at foreign institutions and sites. The graduate experience should contribute to the professional and personal development of the students and equip them to understand and integrate scientific, technical, business, social, ethical, and policy issues to confront the challenging problems of the future.</p>
<p>The IGERT project may draw upon investigators from one or more academic departments within a single institution or from more than one institution. The primary emphasis should be on integrative, innovative approaches to education and training of doctoral students. While IGERT stipends are primarily for supporting doctoral students, they may also be used to support students from minority-serving masters-granting institutions for the purpose of broadening participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines. For these purposes, "underrepresented" is defined as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander (native of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa), disabled, and/or female. In such cases, the minority-serving institution must be a collaborating partner in the IGERT program and the proposal must include a concrete plan for a Masters-to-PhD bridging program. Lists of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Hispanic-Serving Institutions may be found at the following websites: <a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html">http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html</a>; <a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whtc/edlite-tclist.html">http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whtc/edlite-tclist.html</a>; <a href="http://www.chci.org/chciyouth/resources/hispanicserving.htm">http://www.chci.org/chciyouth/resources/hispanicserving.htm</a> Participation of individuals at the undergraduate level is encouraged. However, IGERT funding itself may not be used to support undergraduates.&nbsp; If awarded, IGERT projects have a wide variety of sources for funding undergraduates through existing NSF programs such as Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13646&org=HRD&from=home">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13646&org=HRD&from=home</a>) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU).&nbsp; IGERTs can draw upon a vast pool of REU sites for undergraduates (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm?reu/reu_search.cfm">https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm?reu/reu_search.cfm</a>) as well as seek support for undergraduate research experiences through REU supplements to NSF research grants.</p>
<p>All stipend recipients supported by IGERT funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S., its territories or its possessions. However, individuals, including foreign students, who are supported by other sources of funds may participate in all IGERT activities; those who do will be considered IGERT associates. In contributing to a diverse science and engineering workforce for the future, the IGERT project must include strategies for recruitment, mentoring, and retention aimed at members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Features of IGERT Projects</strong></p>
<p>IGERT projects are expected to incorporate and integrate the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A comprehensive interdisciplinary theme, appropriate for doctoral-level research, that serves as the foundation for traineeship activities;</li>
    <li>Integration of the interdisciplinary research with innovative graduate education and training mechanisms, curricula enhancement, and other educational features that foster strong interactions among participating students and faculty;</li>
    <li>An environment that exposes students to a broad base of state-of-the-art research instruments and equipment and educational tools and methodologies;</li>
    <li>Career development opportunities, provision for developing professional and personal skills, fostering an international perspective, and instruction in ethics and the responsible conduct of research;</li>
    <li>Program strategy and plan for recruitment, mentoring, retention, and graduation of U.S. graduate students, including efforts aimed at members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering (a member of an underrepresented group is American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander (native of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa), disabled, and/or female);</li>
    <li>Strategy and methodology for formative assessments of the project&#146;s effectiveness by individuals internal and external to the institution and program improvements based on these assessments;</li>
    <li>Administrative plan and organizational structure that ensures effective management of the project resources;</li>
    <li>Plan for dissemination of innovative graduate education activities both within and outside the institution; and</li>
    <li>Institutional commitment to facilitating and furthering the plans and goals of the IGERT project, to creating a supportive environment for integrative research and education, and to institutionalizing the successful elements of the project after NSF funding ends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator</strong></p>
<p>The Principal Investigator (PI) shall be the Director of the IGERT project and is expected to be an essential participant in its educational and research activities. The lead institution will have overall responsibility for administration of the award and the PI will have the overall responsibility for the management of the project and interactions with the NSF.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Stage IGERT Competition</strong></p>
<p>Proposers for new and renewal IGERT projects compete in a two-stage process. In the first stage, proposers must submit a preliminary proposal (limit four per institution) that outlines the planned IGERT project. In the second stage, based on panel review of the preliminary proposals, successful proposers will be invited to submit full proposals. Only those proposers invited to submit full proposals may do so, consistent with the institutional limitations discussed in Section IV. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION (below). For renewal proposals, site visits may be conducted as part of the review process.</p>

<a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>
<h3>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
<p><a name="awd_txt" id="awd_txt"></a>
  
  NSF plans to make approximately 20 new and renewal IGERT awards from this competition
  as continuing grants, depending on the quality of the proposals and the availability
  of funds. The anticipated funding amount in FY 2008 is $12,000,000. For new projects,
  the first year award will be up to $400,000 and in amounts up to $600,000 for
  each of the next four years. For renewals, awards will be made in amounts up
  to $600,000 per year for five years. Projects requiring substantially lower levels
  of funding may also be proposed.</p>
<p><strong>For new IGERT projects only:</strong> Additional funds of up to $200,000 may be provided in Year 1 for purposes appropriate to the new IGERT project, including shared research equipment, special-purpose research materials, software, and databases, and faculty release time for development of new curricula. (See Section V. for additional information on Budget and Allowable Costs.)</p>
<p><strong>For new and renewal IGERT projects:</strong> If proposed, additional funding up to a total of $200,000 PER AWARD may also be provided for up to 10 IGERT projects that include strongly integrated international research activities in Years 2 through 5. These activities should be designed to significantly enhance the research, education, and training experiences of the IGERT students. NSF plans on allocating up to $2,000,000 from this competition to support well integrated international research activities for approximately 10 of the IGERT awards.</p>

  <p>A multi-institutional proposal is defined as one that has at least one co-PI at a different academic institution than that of the PI, a subaward to a different academic institution than that of the PI, or both.</p></blockquote>
</span>

<p><strong> Limit on Number of Proposals per PI:</strong>&nbsp;<span>
<blockquote>&nbsp;One may participate as PI or co-PI in only one proposal submission.&nbsp; That restriction applies to preliminary proposals as well as full proposals.&nbsp; A PI or co-PI on one proposal may serve as non-senior personnel on other proposals.</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Additional Eligibility Info:</strong><span>
<blockquote><p><strong>Limit on Number of Preliminary Proposals:</strong> Projects involving research in any of the areas appropriate for funding by the NSF are eligible. An institution may submit no more than four preliminary proposals either as a single institution or as a lead institution in a multi-institution preliminary proposal. A multi-institution is defined as one that has at least one co-PI at a different academic institution than that of the PI, a sub-award to a different academic institution than that of the PI, or both.</p>
<p><strong>Limit on Number of Full Proposals: </strong>Full proposals are by invitation only. However, the following restrictions apply. Of the full proposals invited, an institution may select and submit no more than two single-institution full proposals and, as lead institution with other participating U.S. academic institutions, only one multi-institution full proposal. There is no limit on the number of multi-institution full proposals on which an institution may participate as non-lead institution.</p>
<p>Proposals for new IGERT projects as well as proposals for the renewal of existing IGERT projects may be submitted. However, the limit on the number of preliminary and full proposals an institution may submit as lead institution applies to a combined total of new and renewal IGERT proposals. There is no limit on the number of multi-institution full proposals on which an institution may participate as non-lead institution.</p>
<p>For purposes of this IGERT solicitation, separate institutions are defined as those with separate Sponsored Projects Offices (SPO), even if those institutions are different campuses of the same multi-campus university. For example, if PIs at two different campuses of an academic institution each submit a preliminary or a full proposal through the same SPO, then both preliminary proposals and both full proposals are counted toward the maximum for that institution.</p></blockquote>

        underrepresented in science and engineering. (A member of an under-represented
        group is American Indian/Alaskan native, Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander
        (native of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa), disabled, and/or female. Discuss how
        new students will be staged into the program, the Ph.D. programs in which
        the IGERT graduate students may enroll, the duration and level of their
        support with IGERT funds, and provisions for continued support through
        the completion of degree. IGERT support for two years (24 months) or
        longer for each student is strongly recommended. Alternative plans for
        student support, if appropriate, must be justified in the proposal.&nbsp; Describe
        the diversity makeup of faculty participating in the IGERT project. If
        applicable, discuss how undergraduate student participation will be used
        to further the goals of attracting and graduating members of underrepresented
        groups. Describe the nature and extent of connections with recruitment,
        retention, and professional development programs available at the institution,
        particularly those supported by NSF such as Alliances for Graduate Education
        and the Professoriate, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation,
        Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, Historically Black Colleges
        and Universities - Undergraduate Program, and the Centers for Research
        Excellence in Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=HRD">https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=HRD</a>).
        If your campus currently participates in an NSF-sponsored program to
        enhance diversity (AGEP, LSAMP, HBCU-UP, TCUP, CREST, etc.) you are strongly
        encouraged to partner with them as part of your overall recruitment strategy.&nbsp; If
        your institution already has one or more IGERT awards, describe how the
        the proposed IGERT will interact with, learn from, and build upon the
        existing award(s).</p>

<p><strong>D. References Cited</strong> <strong> </strong>(3-page limit) in FastLane; or <strong>Bibliography &amp; References Cited </strong>in Grants.gov.</p>
<p><strong>E. Biographical Sketches and Current and Pending Support: </strong>A maximum of 20 biographical sketches may be included, with up to 5 additional biographical sketches of international participants when international activities are proposed. The standard NSF 2-page biographical sketches for the PI, co-PI's, and Senior Project Personnel should be prepared in accordance with instructions in the Grant Proposal Guide. Current and pending support is required only for the PI and co-PI's.</p>
<p><strong>F. Budget and Allowable Costs:</strong> Provide a budget for each year of support requested. For new awards, the amount requested should not exceed $400,000 for the first year and $600,000 each year for years two through five. The first-year budget for new awards only may include up to an additional $200,000 as a special allocation for purposes discussed below. For renewal awards the budget should not exceed $600,000 each year. In addition to the amounts described above, for either new or renewal awards, if an international component has been proposed in Years 2 through 5, additional funds not to exceed a total of $200,000 per award may be included to support this effort. A cumulative budget will automatically be generated for the proposal. Awarded funds not expended in the specific year requested may be carried over only with appropriate justification provided in the annual report to NSF and with the approval of the cognizant program officer.</p>
<p>The major portion of the funds must be used for doctoral student stipends and educational and training activities. A limited amount of funds may be budgeted for necessary administrative support, support of short-term visitors, and to partially defray the costs of research and publication by students. No funds for faculty salaries will be provided, with the following exceptions: (a) one month per year of salary support for the Principal Investigator for management purposes; (b) up to 4 months total of faculty salary support for development of IGERT curricula. The faculty salary support for development of curricula should be requested from within the first-year special allocation; however, its expenditure may be extended over the first two years of IGERT project activity. The budget should also include funds for travel for the PI, one graduate student and one administrator to attend the annual IGERT PI meeting in the Washington DC area.</p>
<p>Additional funds requested for international activities should be appropriate to enable the unique benefits expected for the IGERT graduate students and the IGERT project. The primary support is intended for graduate students through internships (university, government and industry), collaborative research and/or fieldwork with foreign collaborators, or in other settings abroad appropriate to the research area. The stays should be of sufficient duration to acculturate the student and provide a meaningful research and education experience. Limited funds may also be used for student preparation, administration of the international activities, and faculty visits to foreign sites for research coordination and developing communication linkages between institutions. Requests for travel funds for the sole purpose of attending international conferences or workshops are not appropriate. Reciprocal visits by foreign researchers and students to the U.S. institutions are encouraged, although NSF funds should normally not be used for such visits. Proposers should consult the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) member of the IGERT Coordinating Committee. Please refer to the web link provided in Section VIII.</p>
<p>The NSF contribution to graduate student stipends is currently $30,000 per year per IGERT trainee for a 12-month appointment, and budgeting for stipends should be made on this basis for each year of the award. All IGERT-supported students are expected to be full-time IGERT trainees. IGERT support for 2 years (24 months per student) or longer is strongly recommended. Alternative plans for graduate student support must be justified in the proposal. NSF also provides a cost-of-education allowance for tuition, health insurance, and normal fees of $10,500 per year per student (for 12 months.) If this allowance is not fully required, then it may be used to support other IGERT student-related activities. Funds requested for graduate student trainees should be entered under Participant Support. The number of trainees anticipated, along with the durations of the appointments, should be listed and consistent with the requested stipend funds. All stipend recipients must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S., its territories or its possessions.</p>
<p>Purchase of shared research equipment, special-purpose research materials, software and databases that cost more than $5,000 per item may be requested within the first-year special allocation, and should be listed under Equipment. Any of those items that cost $5,000 or less per item should be listed under Materials and Supplies. Personnel and shop costs for developing and constructing special instruments may be requested within the regular yearly budget. Funds for facility renovation or for equipment installation or maintenance are not allowed. Awards will carry an 8% allowance for indirect costs based on the total direct cost, excluding equipment and cost-of-education allowances, but not excluding participant support. Please note this is in variance with Chapter II.C.2.g.v of the Grant Proposal Guide and with Chapter V.7.10 of the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.</p>
<p>For multi-institution projects, the lead institution shall submit the proposal, with other participating institutions included under sub-awards. Budgets shall be provided for the overall project as well as individually for the lead institution and for each participating institution/organization that receives a sub-award.</p>
<p><strong>Budget Justification </strong>(3-page limit): Provide a justification for the funds requested for the overall project in each budget category. Describe the proposed allocation of funds in the major budget categories with sufficient clarity to show how resources will be utilized in carrying out the planned IGERT project activities. Indicate the total number of graduate students to be supported and the staging and duration and FTE level of their support on IGERT funds. If the first-year special allocation of funds for new awards is requested, describe in a separate table how the funds are to be used. If additional funds are requested for international activities, describe in a separate table the requested amount and allocations over the project duration, beginning with Year 2 of the award. Provide details of anticipated resource commitments of any other organizations expected to participate in the IGERT project, such as government, industry, non-U.S. institutions, or private foundations. Appropriate letters of commitment from participating organizations should be included in Supplementary Documentation (below). Cost sharing is not required under this solicitation. Any information provided here and in similar places in this solicitation will not be auditable as cost sharing.</p>
<p><strong>G. Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources</strong> (1-page limit): Provide a description of facilities and major instruments that are available to the project and require no additional support from NSF.</p>
<p><strong>H. Supplementary Documentation:</strong> No cost sharing funds are required for IGERT proposals. However, because the IGERT program seeks to catalyze institutional change in graduate education, indications of institutional support for the program and its sustainability, through whatever means seem most appropriate, must be included in the proposal. Up to eight supporting letters, including one that must be from the senior administration of the submitting institution, may be provided as part of the proposal, with up to four additional letters when international activities are proposed. Letters of endorsement from foreign counterparts should discuss the benefits and foreign commitment to the project.</p>
<p>All IGERT full proposals must include at least one internal letter of commitment,
  which should come from the appropriate senior institutional administrator.
  Internal letters of commitment should specify how the institution will facilitate
  implementation of the IGERT and support its goals over the life of the award,
  including broadening participation; they should also specify what features
  are expected to be sustained after the award has ended, and how they will be
  sustained.&nbsp; External letters, if appropriate, must be included for each
  major key outside partner (institution, organization, or individual) involved
  in the IGERT, as well as from any outreach organization that may be assisting
  the IGERT to broaden participation of under-represented groups in the science
  or engineering in its program.&nbsp; External letters should include a description
  of the role that the partner will play in the IGERT (i.e., provide internships,
  access to laboratories, industry mentors, field logistics, outreach to groups
  underrepresented in science and engineering, etc.).&nbsp; External letters
  should also include specific details regarding the partner's contributions
  to the IGERT, such as location and specified period for the internships, access
  to specific instrumentation, laboratory or computing facilities, specific plan
  for recruitment of diverse IGERT participants, etc.).&nbsp; Each letter must
  be one page or less in length.</p>

									Cost sharing is not required by NSF in proposals
									submitted to the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Cost (F&A) Limitations:</strong>
										&nbsp;Partial reimbursement of indirect costs not to exceed 8% of total direct costs, excluding equipment and cost-of-education allowances, but not excluding participant support. Please note this is in variance with Chapter II.C.2.g.v of the Grant Proposal Guide and with Chapter V.7.10 of the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.</p>
<p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations: </strong>
										&nbsp;The NSF contribution to graduate student stipends is currently
										$30,000 per year per IGERT trainee for a 12-month appointment and budgeting
										for stipends should be made on this basis for each year of the award.
										All IGERT-supported students are expected to be full-time IGERT trainees.
										IGERT support for 2 years (24 months per student) or longer is strongly
										recommended. Alternative plans for graduate student support must be
										justified in the proposal. If there is an increase in the approved
										stipend amount beyond $30,000, requests for additional project funding
										during the five-year period may be granted, depending on funds available.
										All stipend recipients must be citizens or permanent residents of the
		U.S., its territories or possessions.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
  (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
  of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
  criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
  and activities.
</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to
    advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different
    fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct
    the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the
    prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore
    creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
    activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How
    well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
    -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF
    is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>In responding to the standard NSF review criteria, reviewers will be asked to place emphasis on the following IGERT program objectives:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Integration and coherence of the interdisciplinary theme in its effectiveness as an intellectual focus for all participating scientists, engineers, and educators;</li>
    <li>Quality of the proposed research efforts, and their appropriateness to the interdisciplinary theme;</li>
    <li>Quality and innovation in the planned graduate education and training mechanisms, and in their integration with the research;</li>
    <li>Effectiveness of career development opportunities, provision for developing professional and personal skills, fostering an international perspective and ability to work in diverse teams, and instruction in ethics and the responsible conduct of research;</li>
    <li>Effectiveness of the strategy for recruitment, mentoring, retention, degree completion, and career progression of U.S. graduate students, including those from groups underrepresented in science and engineering: a partial list of examples of effective strategies might include development of new approaches in information technology or connectivity to engage members of underrepresented groups; collaborations with students and/or faculty who are members of underrepresented groups or are affiliated with minority-serving institutions (MSI); campus visits/presentations at MSI; regular publication of bulletins/newsletters to enhance cross-cultural/gender communication; and monitoring of graduate student retention. Plans for effective recruitment and assessment should be specific and detailed;</li>
    <li>Appropriateness of the plans for assessment of project performance in meeting objectives and expanding the knowledge base in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate education and disseminating results to appropriate professional communities;</li>
    <li>Appropriateness of the administrative plan and organizational structure in assuring effective allocation of project resources and participation by project members;</li>
    <li>Appropriateness of the budget (for full proposals only);</li>
    <li>Commitment of the institution to facilitating and furthering the plans and goals of the IGERT project, to creating a supportive environment for integrative research and education, and to sustaining the successful elements of the project after NSF funding ceases; and</li>
    <li>Quality of the international collaborative activities and benefits to the U.S. participants, if proposed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional criteria for renewal projects:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Quality of outcomes of prior IGERT project, including but not limited to potential for adding to the knowledge base in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate education; and adequacy of the efforts made and quality of the results achieved toward increasing participation of women and underrepresented groups (students and faculty); potential of (new) approaches cited to increase or sustain the diversity goals.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Panel Review</span>.		</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important
  information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Grant
  Policy Manual</em> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website
  at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a></p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available
  through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project
  reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
  project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other
  specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter
  information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
  using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes
  certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>
<p><span>
  &nbsp;In addition IGERT PIs are required to submit their annual project
  reports through a special IGERT Web-based reporting system that standardizes
  the evaluation across all sites. Any proposed carrying forward of
  funds must be justified in the annual report. Within 90 days after
  the expiration of the IGERT award, PIs are required to submit their
  final project reports through the same web-based reporting system
  and in FastLane.
</span></p>
<span><p>The Division of Graduate Education (DGE) will conduct an on-going evaluation
  to determine how effectively the IGERT program is achieving its goal to respond
  to the nation's need for a globally prepared diverse science and engineering
  workforce.&nbsp; Additionally, it is highly desirable to have a structured
  means of tracking trainees beyond graduation to gauge the extent to which they
  follow a career path consistent with the intent of the program and to assess
  the impact the NSF traineeship has had on their graduate education experience.&nbsp; Accordingly,
  trainees will be contacted during and after the completion of this award for
  updates on various aspects of their employment history, professional activities
  and accomplishments, and other information helpful in evaluating the impact
  of the program.&nbsp; Trainees, participating faculty, and affiliated institutions
  should be prepared to cooperate in program-level evaluations conducted by the
  NSF and/or contracted evaluators.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation claims no rights to any inventions or writings
  that might result from its fellowship or traineeship grants.&nbsp; However,
  fellows and trainees should be aware that the NSF, another Federal agency,
  or some private party may acquire such rights through other support for particular
  research.&nbsp; Also, fellows and trainees should note their obligation to
  include an Acknowledgment and Disclaimer in any publication.</p></span><a name="cont" id="cont"></a>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
