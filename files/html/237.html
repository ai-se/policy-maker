        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>EarthCube is a community-driven activity sponsored through a partnership between the NSF Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering's (CISE) Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) to transform research in the academic geosciences community. EarthCube aims to create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner, thus accelerating our ability to understand and predict the Earth system.</p>
            <p>Achieving EarthCube will require a long-term dialog between NSF and the interested scientific communities to develop cyberinfrastructure that is thoughtfully and systematically built to meet the current and future requirements of geoscientists. New avenues will be supported to gather community requirements and priorities for the elements of EarthCube, and to capture the best technologies to meet these current and future needs. The EarthCube portfolio will consist of interconnected projects and activities that engage the geosciences, cyberinfrastructure, computer science, and associated communities. The portfolio of activities and funding opportunities will evolve over time depending on the status of the EarthCube effort and the scientific and cultural needs of the geosciences community.</p>
            <p>This umbrella solicitation for EarthCube allows funding opportunities to be flexible and responsive to emerging needs and collaborative processes. The EarthCube vision and goals do not change over time, and this section of the solicitation will remain constant. Funding opportunities to develop elements of the EarthCube environment will be described in Amendments to this solicitation. Amendments will appear in the Program Description section of the solicitation and will include details on the parameters, scope, conditions, and requirements of the proposal call. Researchers who receive alerts related to solicitation releases will receive notification when the EarthCube solicitation is updated with an Amendment.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>EarthCube is a community-driven activity aimed at transforming the conduct of geosciences research and education. This effort is a partnership between the NSF Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI). The goal of EarthCube is to create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge for all of the geosciences in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner and to accelerate our ability to understand and predict the Earth system.</p>
          <p> In 2009 the Advisory Committee for GEO issued the <em>GEO Vision</em> report: (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/geo/acgeo/geovision/geo_strategic_plans_2012.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/geo/acgeo/geovision/geo_strategic_plans_2012.pdf</a>) identifying the challenges and opportunities facing the geosciences in the next decade. The report included this call to action: "Over the next decade, the geosciences community commits to developing a framework to understand and predict responses of the Earth as a system, from the space-atmosphere boundary to the core, including the influences of humans and ecosystems." In 2014 the Advisory Committee for GEO issued the <em>Dynamic Earth: GEO Imperatives and Frontiers 2015-2020 </em>report (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/acgeo/geovision/nsf_acgeo_dynamic-earth-2015-20.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/geo/acgeo/geovision/nsf_acgeo_dynamic-earth-2015-20.pdf</a>), identifying the priorities and focus areas for the geosciences in the next five years.</p>
          <p align="left">EarthCube responds to the challenges and opportunities of the <em>Geo Vision</em> report and the vision of a national cyberinfrastructure noted in NSF's Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21). In this effort NSF encourages the community to systematically build cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences that is guided by community dialog, governance, and a common vision. EarthCube endeavors to create an environment that is extendable and manageable, and employs or creates technologies that meet the current and future needs of the geosciences community. EarthCube will foster the training and development of data scientists and cyber-savvy geoscientists. It is expected that EarthCube will build off present NSF and Federal investments in geosciences cyberinfrastructure and will integrate state-of-the art cyberinfrastructure, software development and computer science techniques.</p>
          <p>The EarthCube program is designed to be responsive to the needs of and input from the geosciences community, as well as technological advances. Funding opportunities in the EarthCube portfolio will be defined in Amendments to this solicitation and will be based on themes, requirements, and other strategic or community documents from open community activities fostered by EarthCube such as, but not limited to, community meetings, workshops and design and demonstration activities.</p>
          <p>Amendments to this solicitation will appear in the Program Description section and will include details on the type, scope, duration, and size of proposals being requested, funding requirements, additional review criteria, and due dates.</p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The goal of EarthCube is to create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge for all of the geosciences in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner, accelerating our ability to understand and predict the Earth system.</p>
          <p><strong>How To Use This Solicitation:</strong> As noted in the Important Information Section at the beginning of this solicitation, this document serves as an umbrella solicitation for EarthCube. Funding opportunities will be responsive to themes, requirements, and other strategic or community documents from open community activities. In the structure of this solicitation, funding opportunities will be articulated in Amendments in the Program Description.</p>
          <p>The description, vision, and overall goals for EarthCube will not change over time. Only the Amendment Section (see below) will change. When a funding opportunity is available, the Amendment section will detail the specifications of the proposal call including (a) what types of proposals are being solicited; (b) references to the relevant community documents that guided the call and determined the focus of the funding opportunity; (c) the specific funding mechanism(s) employed; (d) proposal due dates or submission windows; (e) any special review criteria and/or reporting criteria; (f) and other specifics of the funding opportunity. As EarthCube evolves over time, new Amendments will replace old Amendments. A listing of all Amendments will be found on the EarthCube NSF Program website (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/">http://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/</a>).</p>


          <p><strong>AMENDMENT VI: </strong></p>
          <p>This is the sixth Amendment to the EarthCube solicitation. The objective of Amendment VI is to solicit proposals in two focus areas 1) EarthCube Integration and 2) EarthCube RCNs.</p>
          <p>This amendment takes recommendations from EarthCube's community governance and the EarthCube Reverse Site Visit Report. The EarthCube program seeks to advance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Innovation: EarthCube should embrace innovation in data sciences and the geosciences. This track looks to identify the most applicable and effective innovations in data science through initial investments to understand how these advances can be leveraged for the geosciences. Past investments under EarthCube in this track include many of the EarthCube Build Blocks projects. Investments in other programs under CIF21, such as DIBBs, can also be considered as Innovations to be exposed and explored within EarthCube.</li>
            <li>Integration: EarthCube should support efforts to move into production those technologies that work best to advance geosciences research through improved interoperability and integration across disparate geosciences research, methods and resources. Production may include implementing technologies into existing GEO data facilities, connecting resources through EarthCube architecture, or building essential elements of EarthCube infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Geosciences Community Infrastructure: Several research communities do not have identified means for sharing the products of their research. This can include discovering, accessing and sharing primary data, tools and other outputs, such as model codes and results. EarthCube should always provide a means for such communities to share their data, whether by leveraging existing resources, or creating cyberinfrastructure that can integrate within the existing ecosystem.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While Innovation, Integration and Geosciences Community Infrastructure are essential for future EarthCube development, this Amendment focuses the budget available to EarthCube in FY 2017 on the Integration and Geosciences Community Infrastructure elements to make practical progress towards the future development of EarthCube&rsquo;s system of systems. The Amendment is arranged as follows:</p>

          <p><strong>(1) EarthCube Integration<br />
            </strong>Award Information: <br />
            Deadline: March 14, 2017<br />
            Estimated Number of Awards: 3-8<br />
            Estimated Award Size and Duration: Awards may be up to 36 months in duration. Budgets must be commensurate with the scope of the work and size of the collaboration.</p>
          <p><strong>Description of the Activity<br />
            </strong>This opportunity supports multidisciplinary demonstration projects to improve interoperability of critical geosciences cyberinfrastructure components, such as data facilities and other resources. This integration effort will enable resources to become part of a system of systems as described in recent EarthCube architecture documents. Community documents describing how the system of systems and workbench to facilitate the integration will operate may be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.earthcube.org/2017-solicitation">https://www.earthcube.org/2017-solicitation</a>.</p>
          <p>Projects must demonstrate two essential components, 1.) implementation of a technical capability across resources that improves interoperability, and 2.) innovative, cross-disciplinary geosciences research outcomes. This aligns with the Integration track for the EarthCube program. Projects that develop resources aligned with the Geosciences Community Infrastructure track are also appropriate for this call if they contain both essential components and connect research products from unconnected scientific communities to EarthCube and other data resources.</p>
          <p>Integration activities build upon previous EarthCube activities and other data science developments, taking advantage of what has been learned in the past funded projects and Governance activities. Integration projects will take these developments and implement the most effective integration solutions to link existing or new infrastructure to benefit multidisciplinary geosciences research.</p>
          <p>Integration Projects must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Involve geosciences use cases tied to NSF GEO-funded science awards and demonstrate cross-disciplinary science outcomes not possible without the integration effort. Proposals will be judged on the innovation and breadth of the science outcomes.</li>
            <li>Improve interoperability between resources and demonstrate how the implementation will be flexible for working within the developing EarthCube system of systems. Proposals will be evaluated on the implementation of existing, vetted technologies and approaches, and the collaboration with the relevant geosciences facilities as well as any cyberinfrastructure and computer science experts needed to develop these strategies.</li>
            <li>Describe how the work fits within the context of resources used and supported within the geosciences, and how the proposed infrastructure would enable those resources. Sustainability of the project beyond the end date must be described.</li>
            <li>Be ready to work closely with EarthCube Governance, and also to work at a future date with a small set of grand challenge use cases that will be identified by NSF and coordinated with EarthCube Governance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Integration Projects may involve implementations that include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The development and adoption of data standards, protocols and methods across facilities or data resources to enable integration of data from various subfields of the geosciences. This can include, but is not limited to the identification and adoption of data quality standards, digital object identifiers (DOIs) for data and other products.
            </li>
            <li>
            The evaluation of existing software, hardware and data resources within and outside EarthCube and the geosciences to identify capability gaps that will drive the development of solutions for identified cross-disciplinary science challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
            The implementation of capabilities developed from past EarthCube awards, like Building Blocks, into existing data facilities so that the capability is now useful to a broad range of geoscientists at a production level.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Specific Requirements: </strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Geosciences Use Cases:</strong> Geosciences research and outcomes that are innovative and that will be enabled by the integration activity must be described in a separate section in the Project Description. NSF GEO award numbers associated with the use case(s) must be listed in this section; this includes awards made by the Divisions of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS), Earth Sciences (EAR), Ocean Sciences (OCE), and Polar Programs (PLR).  Proposals should describe how the scientists associated with these awards will participate in the Integration project, how the scientific work will be carried out if not already supported under the award, and how the work will be disseminated to the academic geosciences community. Proposals will be evaluated on the innovation of the science, breadth and cross-disciplinary nature of the science outcomes, as well as on the nature of the collaboration. Modes of working with GEO awardees include but are not limited to:
              <ul>
                <li>Working with researchers who have data or products from previous awards to connect those outcomes through infrastructure, enabling new scientific advances;</li>
                <li>Working with awardees on realizing the outcomes of a current multi-disciplinary science project; and</li>
                <li>Helping awardees with current awards to work together for an integrated science outcome, or in other ways going beyond the original ability of their awards.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical Implementation</strong>: EarthCube Integration projects must produce a yearly demonstration of progress in implementing technical capabilities. Projects must be ready to follow the EarthCube community guidelines for funded projects, which can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.earthcube.org/2017-solicitation">https://www.earthcube.org/2017-solicitation</a>.  All standards, functions, etc., must also be shared and documented with an associated written document that becomes a public, shared resource.  These demonstrations give the broader community the opportunity to understand the implementation and to assess its role within the larger EarthCube architecture. Proposals must:
              <ul>
                <li>Discuss what will be assessed during the course of the project and demonstrated for the community,</li>
                <li>Clearly articulate how project outcome(s) relate to the goals of EarthCube, and  </li>
                <li>Provide a description of the project's lifecycle/sustainability of efforts, particularly for any created infrastructure that must continue beyond the 36 months of the project.  </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>EarthCube Participation: </strong> All EarthCube-funded projects must participate in continuing EarthCube governance activities. Awardees will be required to participate in planning and demonstration and assessment activities. These awards will be a significant element of further community development of EarthCube. Therefore, awardees must accommodate and budget for participation, providing members for both scientific and technical committees, the EarthCube All-Hands meeting, providing any outputs required for testing and evaluation, and making outcomes transparent to the community. Proposers should describe in their Management plans how their anticipated structure, personnel, and work plan and management will accommodate these responsibilities.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Additional Review Criteria: </strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Geoscience Outcomes: What are the science outcomes described in the proposal? How are they innovative and cross-disciplinary, do they and address grand challenges in the geosciences?  How is the cross-disciplinary science enabled by the Integration project, and would it be possible otherwise?  Are the science outcomes possible given the team and workplan? How many researchers and which domains in the geosciences will benefit from the outcomes of the project and how is the work extensible to other researchers?  Are participants from geosciences communities explicitly identified and are their roles clear?</li>
            <li>Technology Implementation: How does the integration project fit within the framework of resources that serve the geosciences community?

          <p><strong>Description of the Activity</strong></p>
          <p>The goal of 2017 EarthCube Research Coordination Networks (RCNs) is to be closely tied to the science and cyberinfrastructure needs of core geosciences programs and domains supported by GEO. To that end, potential proposers must coordinate EarthCube RCN ideas and discuss submission of any EarthCube RCN proposal with the relevant GEO program directors as well as at least one EarthCube program director.</p>
          <p>EarthCube RCNs are intended to advance geosciences cyberinfrastructure through interaction, discussion and planning between geoscientists and cyberinfrastructure experts. RCNs provide opportunities for academic geosciences communities to organize, seek input, come to consensus and prioritize data, modeling, and technology needs, as well as standards and interoperability within and across domains. Other opportunities exist to realize cyberinfrastructure development and build tools and services. Outcomes must be tangible and directed towards moving geoscientists closer to shared goals. RCNs are an important information and feedback mechanism within the EarthCube process. Results from these projects will provide feedback for the direction of EarthCube, including architecture and geosciences-wide cyberinfrastructure developments.</p>
          <p>Awards will support geosciences communities to organize and partner with like geosciences communities to discuss, plan and coordinate the standards, policies and cyberinfrastructure that will meet their end users' common data, software, computation, networking and training needs. EarthCube RCNs should 1) build and strengthen partnerships between geo- and cyber/computer scientists; 2) foster new collaborations that lead to better scientific outcomes; 3) expose participants to new ideas, methodologies, approaches, tools, and utilities; 4) reduce redundancies and duplication of effort; and 5) expose best practices and "lessons learned" in data management.</p>
          <p>EarthCube RCNs may center on:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>The development of community standards, data citation or other community plans for data management in one or more fields of the geosciences. This will help communities to address NSF requirements for Data Management Plans in proposals.</li>
            <li>The articulation of common cyberinfrastructure and technology grand challenges across different geosciences disciplines, including dialog towards designing potential solutions for data integration, computation, modeling, software and/or visualization needed to meet future scientific and education goals.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>RCNs should explore innovative ideas for implementing virtual organizations, community networking strategies and collaborative technologies. Successful proposals will need to demonstrate broad academic geosciences participation, with an emphasis on active engagement of early-career scientists.</p>
          <p><strong>Specific Requirements</strong></p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Focus/Topic</strong>: EarthCube RCN proposals must be rooted in the academic geosciences community, and include cyber/computer scientists as key participants. Proposals must specify what activities will be undertaken, what groups will be involved, what products will be generated by network activities, and how information about the network and opportunities to participate will be disseminated. The proposal should also outline the expected benefits of the network's activities in moving one or more geosciences fields forward in scientific goals through cyberinfrastructure, as well as the implications for the broader community. The specific outcomes from the RCN should be described.</li>
            <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Participation and involvement in EarthCube Governance, including meetings, events and sharing information between RCNs and other EarthCube projects is required. PIs should allocate financial resources to support representatives in EarthCube meetings and activities. Proposals must include a section on how the network will interact with EarthCube Governance activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Steering Committee</strong>: Each RCN must have a steering committee primarily composed of academic geoscientists. Cyber and/or computer scientists should also have key roles within the network, and these should be described in the proposal. The Steering Committee should reflect the diversity of the network&rsquo;s participants, and be responsible for the network&rsquo;s success, but remain a manageable size. The proposal should articulate the roles of the Steering Committee members and the reasons for their selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Participants:</strong> The size of an RCN is expected to vary depending on the topic or issue and network needs. It is expected that a network will involve investigators at diverse organizations, including different levels of academic institutions. The inclusion of new researchers, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates is strongly encouraged. Proposals should clearly articulate well-developed mechanisms that will maintain openness, ensure access, and actively promote participation by interested parties. Although inclusion of federal agencies, international organizations and commercial partners is welcome, RCNs are intended to serve the needs of geoscientists in US academic institutions. NSF funding predominantly supports participation by US researchers. Any proposed international collaboration should articulate how it strengthens the project's activities. Participants from institutions outside the US are encouraged to seek support from their respective funding organizations. NSF funds may not be used to support the expenses of international scientists and students at their home institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> EarthCube RCNs must produce an outcome within 24 months. They must promote effective communication and provide opportunities for collaboration focused on actionable improvements for the academic geosciences community. Any outcomes of the RCN, including discussion forums, documents, policies and practices must be openly shared with the academic community. Proposals should detail mechanisms that will be used to serve these materials. This should include working closely with other aspects of EarthCube, including EarthCube Governance and other Funded Projects.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Additional Review Criteria: </strong></p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>RCN proposals will be evaluated for their potential to advance geosciences research through effective organization of the community and outcomes that advance data management plans, policies and standards or articulation of cyberinfrastructure needs. RCNs cannot use resources to fund research, build cyberinfrastructure or prototypes, or to sustain existing networks.</li>
            <li>RCNs will be evaluated on how well they represent their respective geosciences communities, the quality and caliber of the collaboration with cyberinfrastructure and computer scientists, and the processes and efforts to engage a broad and diverse set of participants. Proposals will be evaluated on plans to participate in EarthCube Governance and share information with the EarthCube community.</li>
            <li>Projects are expected to have strong management and integration plans that describe how the activity will be coordinated between partners and how the partners will function as a whole.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Proposal Preparation Guidelines for EarthCube RCNs:</strong></p>
          <p>Proposals must follow these guidelines in addition to, or in replacement of, the requirements in Section V.A.</p>

Delineate the procedures used for the selection of initial network participants, along with the plans for maintaining an appropriate degree of openness and for encouraging the involvement of additional interested parties. Means for self-evaluation of progress toward the network goals should be presented as an important part of the management plan.</li>
                <li>Coordination Plan. Describe the plan for coordinating with other EarthCube Governance. If the proposed network will work with other established networks or groups, or if there is a similar activity being planned or ongoing in other countries, describe the plans for coordination and cooperation among the relevant networks.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Budget: In a collaborative project, any collaborative institution with a budget of less than $50,000 must be included as a subaward in the budget of the lead institution's proposal, and not as a separate proposal.</li>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
       
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
   
        <p>Additional Review Criteria for EarthCube funding opportunities is detailed in the Amendment in Section II.</p>
        

       <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Internal NSF Review.</p>
        <p>Specific additional review criteria will vary depending on the funding opportunity and is articulated for each funding opportunity in the Amendment section of this solicitation.</p>
 
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
