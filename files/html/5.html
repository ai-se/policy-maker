            <p>Management and Operations of the Arecibo Observatory

<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) hereby solicits proposals to manage and operate the Arecibo Observatory (AO).  The AO is a multidisciplinary research and education facility. AO&rsquo;s cornerstone research instrument is a 305-meter diameter fixed spherical reflector, located on approximately 120 acres of U.S. Federal Government-owned land near Arecibo, Puerto Rico. AO conducts research in passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and space and atmospheric sciences.</p>
            <p>NSF is currently preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate proposed operational changes at AO due to funding constraints, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In the Draft EIS released in October 2016, NSF evaluated the anticipated environmental impacts stemming from implementation of several proposed alternatives, including the Agency Preferred Alternative: Collaboration with interested parties for continued science-focused operations at AO. The current solicitation supports this Preferred Alternative.</p>
            <p>In cooperation with NSF and within available resources, the proposer will plan and execute a viable program of research and/or education, consistent with the objectives and priorities of the scientific community. The recipient will manage the facilities and equipment provided by NSF, and will provide support and technical personnel to manage AO as a well-integrated research and/or education facility. A significant portion of the AO program should be carried out in collaboration with its stakeholder communities, and other collaborators.</p>
            <p>NSF anticipates greatly reduced and decreasing funding over the life of this effort, to a total of $2M per year by the end of the five-year project period (and pending availability of funds).  In consideration of these reductions, operations and activities cannot be sustained at current levels without external sources of funding.  A viable proposal must demonstrate a feasible and reasonable approach to managing and operating AO, and, if applicable, to obtaining and sustaining a significant share of the AO&rsquo;s operational costs.</p>
            <p>This solicitation encourages creative approaches to providing continued operations of AO.  Proposers must describe how they will establish appropriate partnerships with universities, industry, and/or private organizations; and obtain additional funds (beyond those provided by NSF) to support their proposed activities.  Commensurate with their proposed activities, proposers must provide an overall management structure fostering observing capabilities and scientific data collection and/or an integrated program of education, training and outreach. The funding provided by NSF, however, is contingent upon the recipient conducting passive radio astronomy and aeronomy science activities.</p>
            <p>For increased flexibility in providing funding and activity alternatives, NSF may consider requests made by proposing entities for transfer of the AO title. A viable proposal requesting transfer of title must demonstrate a strong case for why title transfer is desirable.</p>
            <p>The successful proposal would be awarded as a cooperative agreement or master cooperative agreement with cooperative support agreement(s) on or after 1 April 2018 with an anticipated duration of five years, and possibly renewable upon a successful review for an additional five years. A transition period may be proposed.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        <div>
          
          <div>
            <p>NSF is authorized by the National Science Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF supports facilities that provide research capabilities in various scientific disciplines. One such facility, AO, currently provides instrumentation for research in radio astronomy, planetary radar studies, and space and atmospheric sciences.</p>
            <p>The mission of AO has been to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Support, sustain, and advance research in areas of astronomy, planetary studies, and space and atmospheric sciences for the benefit of the scientific research community;</li>
              <li>Acquire, analyze, archive and disseminate AO data;</li>
              <li>Develop instruments and techniques as necessary to support AO-enabled research in partnership with scientists from related sectors, including academia, industry, government and the international community;   </li>
              <li>Develop and maintain a skilled and diverse workforce, as necessary to support the sciences served by AO;</li>
              <li>Provide integrated and effective education and training programs that utilize the knowledge and discoveries made at AO and that strengthen education and public awareness of AO-related science, engineering and technology;</li>
              <li>Develop and sustain appropriate partnerships with universities, industry, private organizations and the international community to enhance AO's scientific productivity and educational impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences&rsquo; (AST) Portfolio Review Committee Report (2012), AO was not in the list of &ldquo;essential AST facilities&rdquo; given in Recommendation 9.15. Instead, it was in the list of additional facilities ranked in Recommendation 9.16: &ldquo;Based on their capabilities and current cost, the committee ranks the remaining facilities in the priority order (highest to lowest): Gemini-North, Arecibo, Mayall, VLBA, NIST, GBT, SOAR, WIYN, and McMath-Pierce.&rdquo;  In this context, the committee recommended &ldquo;continued AST involvement in Arecibo&hellip;be re-evaluated later in the decade in light of the science opportunities and budget forecasts at that time.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></sup> The <em>New Worlds, New Horizons:  Midterm Assessment</em> (15 Aug 2016) reinforced this, with Recommendation 3.1 noting: &ldquo;The NSF should proceed with divestment from ground-based facilities that have a lower scientific impact&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup><a title="" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Geospace Section (GS) Portfolio Review Committee (PRC) was charged by the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences (AC/GEO) to review the most promising Geospace science strategies and critical capabilities and to reconcile these with the science goals described by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics. The GS is associated with the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) in the Geosciences Directorate.  Science grant programs supporting research in aeronomy, magnetospheric physics, and solar-terrestrial physics combined with program support for ionospheric radar and lidar (Geospace Facilities) and Space Weather observations (SuperDARN and AMPERE) constitute the GS portfolio. This PRC review was carried out using the assumption of an inflation-adjusted, flat budget for GS over the next decade to FY 2026. The PRC recommendations include the reduction of annual NSF/AGS Arecibo Observatory funding from $4.1 million to $1.1 million by 2020. The NSF/GEO Directorate commissioned a review from a second panel assembled by the National Academy of Science that was given the charge of assessing the process by which the PRC findings and recommendations were reached.  The results of this review are expected in early 2017.</p>
            <p>NSF is currently preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate proposed operational changes at AO due to funding constraints, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  NSF is also completing its compliance obligations with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  A draft version of the EIS (Draft EIS) was released on 28 October 2016.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></sup> In the Draft EIS NSF evaluated the anticipated environmental impacts stemming from implementation of several proposed alternatives, including:  1) No-Action Alternative; 2) <em>Alternative 1</em> - Collaboration with interested parties for continued science-focused operations at Arecibo Observatory (identified in the Draft EIS as the Agency Preferred Alternative; the current solicitation supports this alternative); 3) <em>Alternative 2</em> - Collaboration with interested parties for continued education-focused operations at Arecibo Observatory; 4) <em>Alternative 3</em> - Mothballing of facilities (suspension of operations in a manner such that operations could resume efficiently at some future date); 5) <em>Alternative 4</em> - Partial deconstruction and site restoration; and 6) <em>Alternative 5</em> - Full deconstruction and site restoration.</p>
            <p>Following the 45-day public comment period that ended on 12 December 2016, NSF is preparing a Final EIS. Concurrently with the EIS process, NSF is working with consulting parties under Section 106 of the NHPA to find ways to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate any adverse effects on nationally significant historic properties at AO as a result of implementation of any of the proposed alternatives.  Likewise, NSF is working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to evaluate the anticipated impacts from implementation of the proposed alternatives on threatened/endangered species and/or their habitats.</p>
            <p>After the conclusion of NSF&rsquo;s compliance with these federal statutes, NSF will prepare a Record of Decision that documents its chosen course of action with regard to AO.  If a decision is made to transfer AO title to another owner, that transfer may require agreements to protect threatened/endangered species and their habitats and/or certain measures to address impacts to significant historic properties.</p>
            <p>AO is currently funded at about $8.3M per year from NSF ($4.2M from AST and $4.1M from AGS), supplemented by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funding at a level of approximately $3.6M per year.  NSF anticipates funding for future AO management and operations, as described in Section III, to be reduced from current levels.</p>
            <p>AO is currently managed through a cooperative agreement with SRI International (SRI) who together with Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) form the Arecibo Management Team. The National Science Board has adopted the principle that NSF awards should be competed to assure the best use of NSF funds for supporting research and education.</p>
            <p>Through this program solicitation, NSF hereby requests proposals for the management and operation of AO through a cooperative agreement beginning on or after 1 April 2018, and continuing for a five-year award period.

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
        <div>
<p><strong>A. Description of the Arecibo Observatory</strong></p>
          <p>AO is a multidisciplinary research and education facility. AO&rsquo;s cornerstone research instrument is a 305-meter diameter, fixed, spherical reflector, located on approximately 120 acres of U.S. Government-owned land in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, some 10 miles inland from the city of Arecibo.  AO conducts passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and observations of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.</p>
          <p>In the 1990s, a major upgrade was conducted in which the telescope was equipped with aberration-correcting Gregorian optics and outfitted with a suite of state-of-the-art, low-noise receivers that cover frequency bands ranging from 400 MHz to 10 GHz.  A seven-feed array receiver, the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), was commissioned in FY 2006 and is now conducting routine science observations. Operating near 1.4 GHz, ALFA consists of a cluster of seven cooled dual-polarization feeds, a fiber-optical transmission system, and digital back-end signal processors. The installation and commissioning of new, wide-band spectrometers in FY 2008 allows up to three observing programs to be conducted simultaneously on each sky pointing. </p>
          <p>Additionally, a 1 MW 2380 MHz radar system is available for solar system studies, and a 430 MHz incoherent scatter radar is used for space and atmospheric sciences research.  Several lidars and other optical instruments are also located on-site. An ionospheric high-frequency heating facility is now operational at AO at frequencies of 5.1 MHz and 8.175 MHz, with an effective radiated power of approximately 200 MW.  The 12-meter steerable radio antenna to be used for phase-referencing Very Long Baseline Interferometric (VLBI) and geodesic observations is scheduled to be operational by March 2018.  </p>
          <p>The AO-Remote Observing Facility is operational on the island of Culebra, approximately 95 miles east of Arecibo.  The remote, and undeveloped, nature of the island allows for the simultaneous use of optical instruments and the Arecibo 430 MHz radar, with considerably greater probability of clear skies.</p>
          <p>Currently, AO is staffed at approximately 120 Full-time Equivalent (FTE) employees, of which about 100 are funded by NSF.  The remaining FTEs are supported by a grant from NASA, by the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center, and by other funding sources. Further details about the facilities and operations managed by AO may be found on the AO web site at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.naic.edu/">http://www.naic.edu/</a>.</p>
          <p>AO administers observing time to the astronomy, planetary science, and space and atmospheric sciences communities via competitive observing proposals.  Typically, each year AO evaluates approximately 100 proposals and allocates observing time to several hundred users. Approximately 75 percent of astronomy users conduct their observing programs remotely via networked control software, while for radar and lidar observations users are typically on-site.</p>
          <p>Researchers use the AO observational facilities to study such diverse areas as the origin and evolution of magnetic fields, pulsars and fundamental physics, complex and pre-biotic molecules in the interstellar medium, and the formation and evolution of galactic structure, as well as topics in solar system astronomy such as the physical properties of asteroids, planetary surfaces and moons, and the post-discovery characterization and orbital refinement of near-Earth asteroids.</p>
          <p>The AO incoherent scatter radar is part of an NSF-supported network of radars strategically distributed to observe the transport of radiative energy and charged particles, from their origins at the sun to their deposition in Earth's upper atmosphere.  The sensitivity of the AO radar system allows it to measure the density, temperature and motion of plasma in Earth's ionosphere with high temporal and spatial resolution.</p>
          <p>In addition to supporting a multidisciplinary user community, AO has provided educational and public outreach programs at all levels.  These programs include observing support for graduate students, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), web-based public outreach, and the operation and maintenance of the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center.  The REU and RET programs are funded through a separate NSF award.  Partnership programs in education and public outreach have reached tens of thousands of K&ndash;12 students in public and private school systems in Puerto Rico with enrichment programs in astronomy, space and atmospheric sciences.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Description of Recipient Responsibilities</strong></p>
          <p>In responding to this solicitation, proposing organizations are encouraged to consider alternative models of operations and governance, changes to programmatic scope, and effective partnerships that would leverage NSF support to sustain AO as a national, multi-user facility that is responsive to its stakeholders in the scientific community and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Within available resources, and consistent with the expectations and criteria identified in this solicitation, the viable proposal will present a compelling, sustainable vision for AO that supports an optimal suite of user-driven research and/or education activities through effective structures for management and operations. Proposals for science-focused operations, educational-focused operations, or a mix of the two will be considered under this solicitation.  Proposals may include a suite of science activities (for example, as provided currently), or a subset of these activities.  <strong><em>However, the funding provided by AST (see below) is contingent upon the recipient conducting passive radio-astronomy-science activities, and that from AGS (see below) is contingent upon the recipient conducting aeronomy-science activities</em></strong>. </p>
          <p><strong>CORE EXPECTATIONS</strong></p>
          <p>As the AO managing organization, the recipient will work closely with NSF and the scientific research community to ensure that AO supports, sustains, and advances science as enabled by AO's research capabilities. The recipient will be accountable for fulfilling AO&rsquo;s mission through a strategy that capitalizes on the Federal investment to serve the scientific community, and, to the extent possible, to promote research. Note this mission may change based on the response to this solicitation.</p>
          <p>The recipient will be responsible for the overall management and performance of AO, including the infrastructure, instrumentation and staff, and for maximizing the benefits to the scientific research community through a strategically planned scope of activities.</p>
          <p>In cooperation with NSF, AO will plan and execute a viable and coherent program of research.  The recipient will manage facilities and equipment provided by NSF, will provide additional facilities and equipment as necessary, and will develop a diverse and inclusive team of expert support and technical personnel to manage AO as a scientifically competitive research and/or education facility. AO is a multidisciplinary resource; as such, a significant portion of the AO research program should be carried out in collaboration with its stakeholder communities.</p>
          <p>The recipient will be expected to meet the highest standards for service and delivery to the scientific community and to demonstrate a proactive and effective approach to performance management. The recipient will ensure that AO operates with integrity and transparency, maintaining quality and responsiveness in administration and management.</p>
          <p>NSF may consider proposals requesting the transfer of title to AO from the NSF to the recipient (whether for the entire facility and land, or some subset).  Proposals requesting such a title transfer must make a compelling case for, and demonstrate the necessity and viability of, the transfer. NSF may elect at its sole discretion to engage one or more proposing entity or entities to explore the details of a transfer request.</p>
          <p>If proposed activities require more than the funding provided by the NSF, the responder must show detailed plans for how funding will be obtained, and the role, if any, of collaborations and partnerships.  If partnerships and collaborations are proposed, the responder should discuss partnership risks. The responder will provide a compelling management structure commensurate with the scientific and/or educational activities they propose.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Specific Duties</em></strong></p>
          <p>The proposer will describe in detail the specific activities they expect to conduct under their management and operations plan.  These may include, as appropriate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Operating and maintaining AO buildings and facilities, and managing AO staff and all activities according to best practices and in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations;</li>
            <li>Providing upgrades, enhancements and new services, as required and within available resources, to ensure community access to state-of-the art facilities, data and support;</li>

          <p>The recipient will be responsible for staffing and managing the AO to ensure that on-site instruments are able to operate in response to high-priority scientific research conducted by qualified scientists. To this end the proposer will articulate a strategic plan for maintaining a viable, community-driven scope of observatory operations and will employ mechanisms for reviewing and scheduling user access through an open process (at least for NSF-funded portions of research).  <strong>The proposer should identify which existing AO infrastructure they plan to utilize for their proposed activities</strong>.</p>
          <p>The proposer will provide a data management plan that describes the acquisition, analysis, archiving and dissemination of all the AO data, including the definition of proprietary periods and appropriate cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity to meet the proposed scope of user community support.</p>
          <p><em>Science</em> <em>(as appropriate)</em></p>
          <p>Commensurate with the level of funding provided by NSF, the proposer will define a scientific program plan for AO that demonstrates responsiveness to community-based scientific objectives, an innovative vision built on existing and potential capabilities of AO, a well-defined scope of high-priority activities, and a credible plan for establishing the necessary resources to support the proposed suite of activities. Science activities beyond those supported by NSF may be supported by proposed cost-sharing activities.</p>
          <p>As defined by the proposed science program, the proposer will ensure that AO has sufficient internal or external expertise to (1) support outside users, (2) help guide decisions relating to current and future instrumentation and observing modes, (3) develop and maintain data acquisition and data processing software, and (4) develop and implement policies and strategies for data availability and data archiving.</p>
          <p>As appropriate, recipients will be responsible for managing radio frequency interference (RFI) and frequency licensing and certifications. The recipient must maintain a vigilant awareness of the radio frequency environment of AO through a program of RFI monitoring, and take all appropriate steps to mitigate to the extent possible the impact of such signals on the observational mission of AO. The recipient will cooperate with NSF's efforts to shape national and international regulations and policies for the purpose of maintaining a manageable RFI environment in which to conduct AO science operations, if required.</p>
          <p><em>Access</em></p>
          <p>U.S. national telescope facilities are open to all astronomers regardless of institutional or national affiliation, at a level commensurate with funding provided by NSF.  For any NSF-funded observing time, the proposer should adhere to the Principles for Access to Large Federally Funded Astrophysics Projects and Facilities, recommended by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee (AAAC) in March 2014.  These include the following key principles applicable to an operating observatory:</p>
          <ul>

          <p><strong><em>1. Transition Plan</em></strong></p>
          <p>Proposing organizations may be funded for a transition period preceding the five-year award.  If a new recipient is selected to operate AO, the incumbent will cooperate with the successor to the extent necessary to facilitate uninterrupted support for AO during the transition period and will provide transfer of legal rights to relevant property and equipment. NSF will support additional, appropriate, transition costs by a successor recipient if different from the current recipient.</p>
          <p>Organizations should provide, as a supplementary document not to exceed 10 pages, a detailed transition plan and budget for a transition period preceding the new award.</p>
          <p>The transition plan must include, at a minimum:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A proposed duration and schedule for the transition period;</li>
            <li>Estimated resource needs for the transition period;</li>
            <li>Plans for recruitment, orientation and training;</li>
            <li>Plans for changes to staffing, facilities or operational modes;</li>

            <li>Identification of assumptions that underlie the transition plan.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposing organizations also must provide a detailed budget for a transition period preceding the new award. This information must be provided as a supplementary document identified as <strong>Transition Budget. </strong>The budget must be presented in the same style with all applicable budget line items as for the budget for each year of the proposal. If a new recipient is selected to manage and operate AO, the incumbent will cooperate with the successor to the extent necessary to facilitate uninterrupted support for AO during the transition period and will provide transfer of legal rights to relevant property and equipment. NSF will support additional, appropriate transition costs by a successor recipient if different from the current recipient.</p>
          <p><em>The transition budget should not include non-renewal costs of the incumbent, including medical insurance, severance pay, or other costs incurred by the incumbent under the current cooperative agreement, including costs related to the nonrenewal of subawards. If a new operator is selected, the incumbent may submit to NSF costs related to the cooperative agreement non-renewal, and these costs will be considered separately.</em></p>
          <p><strong><em>2. Financial Capability</em></strong></p>
          <p>In a supplementary document labeled <strong>Financial Capability</strong>, proposing organizations must provide the following in support of the organization's financial condition and capability:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A detailed structure and plan for implementing and monitoring business systems and internal controls for financial management and accounting, property standards, equipment standards, procurement standards, reporting and records management.</li>
            <li>Total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees, with supporting information such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys, and studies of professional, public and private organizations used in establishing the total compensation structure.</li>

            <li>A current indirect cost rate proposal and supporting financial data. If the organization's indirect cost rates have been approved by another Federal agency, provide copies of such agreements.  NSF does not participate in or contribute to the cost of Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) and such costs shall bear a proportionate share of overhead and G&amp;A costs; therefore, IR&amp;D costs should be excluded from indirect expense pools and included in the appropriate distribution bases.  If the organization has no IR&amp;D costs, a statement to that effect should be included with the indirect cost rate proposal;</li>
            <li>A current Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) Disclosure Statement, if applicable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>3. Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary (text-searchable PDF up to 20 pages in length)</em></strong></p>

          B. Budgetary Information
        </h4>
<p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
        <p>Voluntary committed cost sharing may be included. If accepted by the Foundation, the cost sharing commitment becomes legally binding and is subject to audit.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>Other budgetary limitations apply</p>
        <p><strong>Budget Preparation Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p>The proposal must identify all staffing and budgetary information necessary to describe how the organization will fulfill the expectations in Section I, Introduction, and Section II, Program Description, of this solicitation. Requested budget amounts for each year of the proposal should reflect the level considered necessary to perform the NSF-funded activities described in the proposal.  Proposers also should be cognizant of budget constraints implied by the estimated funding levels provided under Section III, Award Information.</p>
        <p>A budget justification, not to exceed 15 pages, tied directly to the integrated WBS and WBS Dictionary for the proposal must be submitted with the budgets for each year, and must be in sufficient detail to show how the proposer reached the amounts specified in the budget.  NSF anticipates performing a cost analysis of the successful proposal budget in accordance with NSF's Large Facilities Manual (LFM; the latest version is available here <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp</a>). A draft version of LFM Section 4.2 (Cost Estimating and Analysis) will be provided for proposal preparation. Proposing organizations are required to follow the instructions in the PAPPG (17-1), effective January 30, 2017 (see Budget and Budget Justification in: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/nsf17_1.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/nsf17_1.pdf</a>)</p>
        <p>Enter the anticipated total level of subrecipient support on line G5, Subawards, of the FastLane budget or line F5 of the R&amp;R Budget Form in Grants.gov. Proposals require the inclusion of separate budgets for subawards that exceed $250,000 per year, with a budget justification and detailed explanation of the proposing organization's cost analysis of that budget, for a maximum of 3 pages each.  Examples include budgeted months and salaries for personnel, quotations to support budgeted equipment, itemized listing of material and supplies with support quotations, statements of risk assessments and monitoring plans for each subrecipient, cost price analysis to support that the proposed subaward amounts are reasonable and copies of the subrecipient responsibility determinations, including adequacy of accounting system and financial capability.  For subawards valued at less than $250,000 year, include the costs in the aggregate on the subaward line in the budget.</p>
        <p>Proposing organizations may include a fee in their proposed budget for completion of the work effort under the award. The fee must be clearly identified as such in the budget justification.  If submitting through Fastlane, fee is entered on line &ldquo;G (6) Other&rdquo;, of the NSF budget form.  Fee may not be burdened with indirect rate or any other costs.  Fees will be evaluated for reasonableness by NSF using a structured approach as prescribed in Agency procedures.</p>
        <p>NSF will  provide guidelines for recipients that receive fee to encourage the utmost discretion and appropriate consideration in the use of fee, to include examples of inappropriate uses of fee (e.g., including but not limited to not using fee on alcoholic beverages or lobbying as set forth at 2 CFR &sect; 200.450 and 48 CFR 31.205-22).  NSF will reserve the authority to review a recipient&rsquo;s actual use of fee.  Accordingly, recipients must separately track and account for uses of fee provided under NSF awards.  The terms and conditions of the award will specify the fee arrangement including the basis for incremental fee payments.  NSF will consider reductions in future fee if a recipient&rsquo;s actual use of fee is in contravention with the guidelines on inappropriate uses.</p>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>Any proposed cost sharing in the budget and/or budget justification is considered <em>voluntary committed cost sharing.</em> When voluntary committed cost sharing is included in the budget justification, and accepted by the Foundation, the commitment of funds becomes legally binding and is subject to audit. Proposing organizations must provide full details of the cost-sharing plan and related activities &ndash; including an explanation of the source, nature, amount and availability of any proposed cost sharing &ndash; in the budget justification.</p>
        <p>When applicable, the estimated value of any in-kind contributions also should be included.  An explanation of the source, nature, amount and availability of any proposed cost sharing must be provided in the budget justification.  Contributions may be made from any non-Federal source, including non-Federal grants or contracts, and may be cash or in-kind. 2 CFR &sect; 200.306 describes criteria and procedures for the allowability of cash and in-kind contributions in satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements. It should be noted that contributions derived from other Federal funds or counted as cost sharing toward projects of another Federal agency must not be counted towards meeting the specific cost sharing requirements of the NSF award.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the level of cost sharing required by the NSF solicitation and reflected in the NSF award budget may result in termination of the NSF award, disallowance of award costs and/or refund of award funds to NSF by the awardee.</p>
        <p>Organizations that have not previously received NSF awards should review the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pnag/pnag161.pdf">Prospective New Recipient Guide</a> for additional guidance in preparing their budget submission.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <h4><a name="reviewcrit"></a>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>In addition to individual reviews of each proposal by outside experts, a panel of reviewers will be convened to assess the relative merits of all proposals submitted for consideration by the NSF Program Officer. To further clarify the panel's understanding of the proposal(s), the evaluation may include one or more reverse site visits to be held at the NSF offices in Virginia. Based on their evaluation, the panel will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>In any case, the Program Officer's final recommendation will not be made until the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process described in Section I, Introduction, is complete. Depending on the outcome of the EIS process, an award may not be made.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposal recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the <em>NSF</em> <em>Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp</a>.</p>
        <div>
          <p>The managing organization will be required to provide annual program plans, including long-range plans, and quarterly reports for all programs at AO, along with other reports as may be required by NSF. In addition, as a requirement under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), NSF is required to report on the Federal Performance Goals for Facilities.  Any and all facilities with an annual budget exceeding a specific threshold must report on their operations activities; and any and all construction/upgrade projects that exceed a total project cost of a specific threshold must report on their construction/upgrade activities. Therefore, the recipient will be required, upon request of the cognizant NSF program officer, to submit annual reports related to the GPRA performance goals. This may include the collection and submission of specific data related to the NSF GPRA requirements.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
