          General Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program (NRT)

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The NRT program seeks proposals that ensure that graduate students in research-based master&rsquo;s and doctoral degree programs develop the skills, knowledge, and competencies needed to pursue a range of STEM careers. The NRT program includes <strong>two tracks</strong>: the <strong>Traineeship Track</strong> and the <strong>Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track</strong>.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Traineeship Track</strong> is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the use of a comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. For FY2016, there are four priority areas: (1) Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (DESE), (2) Understanding the Brain (UtB), (3) Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS), and (4) any other interdisciplinary research theme of national priority.  The priority research areas for the FY2017 competition will be (1) UtB, (2) INFEWS, and (3) any other interdisciplinary research theme of national priority.</p>
            <p>
              The <strong>IGE Track</strong> focuses on test-bed projects aimed at piloting, testing, and validating innovative and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education.  IGE projects are intended to generate the knowledge required for their customization, implementation, and broader adoption. While the Traineeship Track promotes building on the current knowledge base to develop comprehensive programs to effectively train STEM graduate students, the IGE Track supports testing of novel models or activities with high potential to enrich and extend the knowledge base on effective graduate education approaches. </p>
            <p>The NRT program addresses both workforce development, emphasizing broad participation, and institutional capacity building needs in graduate education. For both tracks, strategic collaborations with the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, national laboratories, field stations, teaching and learning centers, informal science centers, and academic partners are encouraged. </p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
      
         
            <p>Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduate education is poised to undergo a major transformation. The drivers for change include recent major national reports that have examined the state of STEM graduate education<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, the accelerating pace of science and engineering discoveries and technological innovations, national STEM workforce trends, the growing internationalization of science and engineering, and the unrealized potential to align graduate education practices and models with increasing understanding of how people learn. In addition there is increasing recognition that addressing the grand challenges in science and engineering requires interdisciplinary and broader professional training that is atypical for most graduate programs. These realities and the increasing calls for new approaches to STEM graduate education represent an extraordinary opportunity.  Accordingly, this NRT solicitation encourages proposals in two tracks &mdash; the <strong>Traineeship Track</strong> and <strong>Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track</strong> &mdash; to test, develop, and implement innovative and effective STEM graduate education models, promote interdisciplinary and broad professional training of graduate students, and foster fundamental research advances in support of national priorities.  </p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p><strong>A. Traineeship Track</strong></p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Focus and goals</strong></li>
   <p>The Traineeship Track is dedicated to supporting highly effective training of STEM graduate students in an interdisciplinary research area through a comprehensive traineeship approach that comprises elements that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.</p>
          <p>Goals of the Traineeship Track program are to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Catalyze and advance cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in high priority areas,</li>
            <li>Increase the capacity of U.S. graduate programs to produce interdisciplinary STEM professionals with technical and transferable professional skills for a range of research and research-related careers within and outside academia, and</li>
            <li>Develop innovative approaches and knowledge that will promote transformative improvements in graduate education.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Creation of sustainable programmatic capacity at institutions is an expected outcome. Proposals, accordingly, should describe mechanisms to institutionalize effective training elements after award closure.</p>
          <li>
            <strong>Traineeship and trainees</strong></li>
     <p>
            An NRT traineeship is dedicated to the comprehensive development of graduate students as versatile STEM professionals for a range of research and research-related careers within and outside academia. Proposals submitted to the Traineeship Track, accordingly, should focus on and demonstrate strong commitment to technical and professional training of STEM graduate students that emphasizes research training but extends well beyond it. In addition to research training, NRT projects are expected to develop trainees&rsquo; technical skills broadly, including facility and/or familiarity with the techniques, languages, and cultures of fields integral to the interdisciplinary research theme; foster the development of transferable professional skills; and provide trainees with mentoring and vocational counseling from professionals who have the backgrounds, experience, and skills to advise trainees on how to prepare for a variety of STEM career pathways. </p>
          <p>
            NRT is intended to benefit a population of STEM graduate students larger than just those who receive an NRT stipend; NRT trainees do not have to receive NRT stipend or tuition support. An NRT trainee, accordingly, is defined as a STEM graduate student, irrespective of funding source, who is accepted into an institution&rsquo;s NRT program and completes the required NRT elements (e.g., courses, workshops, projects, and other training activities specific to the NRT experience) set by the program. To further maximize the number of students benefiting from NRT activities, proposers are expected to make available (within the capacity and budget limitations of the award) NRT program elements to other STEM graduate students who are not NRT trainees.</p>
 <p>
            NRT trainees must be master&rsquo;s and/or doctoral STEM students in a research-based degree program that requires a thesis or dissertation. If an institution&rsquo;s NRT program includes both master&rsquo;s and doctoral students, the proposal should identify any differences in NRT program requirements, as well as mechanisms to foster the development of a collective NRT graduate student community. NRT stipends and support for customary costs of education (tuition and required fees) are limited to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. However, international students can participate as non-stipend-supported NRT trainees or as non-trainees.</p>
    <li>
            <strong>Key features of the Traineeship Track</strong></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Development of innovative and potentially transformative approaches to STEM graduate education, informed by evidence.</li>
            <li>Extension of NRT program elements to non-NRT trainees to benefit a larger population of STEM graduate students across an institution.</li>
            <li>Dissemination of outcomes and gained insights from NRT training approaches.</li>
            <li>Facilitation and advancement of novel, potentially transformative interdisciplinary research in areas of high priority to the nation.</li>
            <li>Comprehensive training of STEM graduate students, including the development of technical and professional skills for both research and research-related careers within and outside academia.</li>
            <li>Evidence -based strategies to broaden participation of students from diverse backgrounds.</li>
            <li>Robust formative assessment that is central to the traineeship and routinely informs and improves practice.</li>
          </ol>
          <li><strong>Priority Research Areas</strong></li>
    <p>
            The NRT Traineeship Track has priority interdisciplinary research areas that change periodically. For FY2016, there are four priority areas: (1) Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (DESE), (2) Understanding the Brain (UtB), (3) Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS), and (4) any other interdisciplinary research theme of national priority.  The priority research areas for the FY2017 competition will be (1) UtB, (2) INFEWS, and (3) any other interdisciplinary research theme of national priority.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the research area, proposals must clearly describe an overarching interdisciplinary research focus and outline how the research theme will foster high-return, interdisciplinary synergies.  Proposals should also describe how the training and research elements will be integrated and justify the need for bold and innovative approaches to train graduate students in the thematic area.  In keeping with the broader goals of the NRT program, proposals should demonstrate significant impact on the design and testing of new curricula and career-focused training approaches specific to the priority research area.  Proposals should also discuss the project's potential to have impact beyond the institution, including the possible broad adoption of approaches, curricula, and instructional material within the relevant disciplines.</p></ol>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>  <em><strong>Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (DESE)</strong></em></li>
<p>
            Across all areas of science and engineering, challenging computational problems are emerging and data of massive scale and complexity are being generated through a variety of methods. This data explosion has led to a growing need for new interdisciplinary advances in mathematical, computational, and statistical algorithms, prediction techniques, and simulation and modeling methodologies, as well as new approaches to data collection, data analysis and visualization, data integration and interoperability, and data stewardship. At the same time, computational models and algorithms, in the form of rich new software and computing systems, are playing a critical role in the solution of complex computational and data-related problems. In light of these developments, NSF recognizes the need to address fundamental challenges advancing computational and <em>data-enabled science and engineering</em>. This is especially important given NSF's central role in the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI<a title="" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>), including advances in High-Performance Computing (HPC), the HPC ecosystem essential for scientific discovery, and workforce development. DESE proposals aligned with the NSCI should address how their projects contribute to the NSCI objectives.</li>
          <p>Of particular interest for this research area are focused interdisciplinary efforts that include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Partnerships between computational and mathematical and other science and engineering domains supported by NSF, driving forward interdisciplinary research by effectively managing and exploiting heterogeneous data sources and models through advances in model-based analysis, data storage and management, analytics, and visualization.</li>
            <li>Foundational and applied research on tools essential for advanced scientific and engineering discovery and technological innovation in collaboration with the domain sciences. Such tools could include computational models and the underlying theory and methodology; algorithms; and effective utilization of computing and communications resources.</li>
            <li>Research and development of novel end-to-end science-driven scenarios that integrate and leverage major cyberinfrastructure investments including high-end supercomputers, cloud environments, real-time and remote visualization, provisionable networks, distributed data archives, and software frameworks.</li>
            <li>Integration of educational and training opportunities with major facilities and infrastructure investments in multiple STEM domains.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong><em>Understanding the Brain (UtB)</em></strong></li>
          <p>The overall goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity of the brain in action and in context.  Advanced technological, experimental, analytical, and theoretical innovations are currently expanding the scope and scale of fundamental investigations across scientific and engineering disciplines to advance the understanding of the brain and promote the translation of discoveries to societal benefits. In light of these advances, NSF recognizes the need to promote fundamental training at the graduate level in research directed towards understanding how the brain functions to elicit behavior and cognition. The general ongoing scientific priority areas for NSF&rsquo;s role in this field of research are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop innovative neurotechnologies to monitor and analyze brain activity, as well as new tools, experimental approaches, theories, and models to integrate neuroscience information across scales and scientific disciplines.</li>
            <li>Identify the fundamental relationships among neural activity, cognition, and behavior.</li>
            <li>Transform our understanding of how the brain responds, learns, and adapts to changing environments and recovers from lost functionality.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><em><strong>Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS)</strong></em></li>
          <p>Humanity is reliant upon the physical resources and natural systems of the Earth for the provision of food, energy, and water. It is becoming imperative that we determine how society can best integrate across the natural and built environments to provide for a growing demand for food, water, and energy while maintaining appropriate ecosystem services. Factors contributing to stresses in the food, energy, and water systems include increasing regional, social, and political pressures as result of land use change, climate variability, and heterogeneous resource distribution. These interconnections and interdependencies associated with the food, energy and water (FEW) nexus create research grand challenges in understanding how the complex, coupled processes of society and the environment function now, and in the future. There is a critical need for research that enables new means of adapting to future challenges. The FEW systems must be defined broadly, incorporating physical processes (such as built infrastructure and new technologies for more efficient resource utilization), natural processes (such as biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles), biological processes (such as agroecosystem structure and productivity), social/behavioral processes (such as decision making and governance), and cyber elements. Investigations of these complex systems may produce discoveries that cannot emerge from research on food or energy or water systems alone. It is the synergy among these components in the context of sustainability that will open innovative science and engineering pathways to produce new knowledge and novel technologies to solve the challenges of scarcity and variability.</p>
          <p>Of particular interest for this research priority theme are interdisciplinary efforts that include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Research that builds the fundamental knowledge base on the FEW systems.</li>
            <li>Research that creates innovative solutions to minimize waste and resource consumption, and/or encourage reuse within the systems.</li>
            <li>Developing new ways to integrate heterogeneous data on complex FEW systems.</li>
            <li>Analyzing, modeling, forecasting, and managing natural and built systems critical to FEW.</li>
            <li>Training a workforce to understand that these multifaceted interactions are impacted by physical, chemical, biological, social, cultural, behavioral, and economic processes as well as decisions made by individuals, organizations, and institutions.</li>
            <li>Opportunities for trainees to partner with industry, government, community and non-profit stakeholders that work within the FEW nexus.</li>
            <li>Curriculum that prepares trainees to communicate across INFEWS related disciplines as well as communicating with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public about INFEWS science and issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong><em>Other Crosscutting, Interdisciplinary Theme</em></strong></li>
          <p>An interdisciplinary research theme in an area other than DESE, UtB, or INFEWS should align with NSF or other national STEM research priority areas and have high potential for development of novel, innovative practices in graduate education. Proposers should describe the importance of the NRT project&rsquo;s thematic focus to the nation and the particular need to train students for a variety of careers in that thematic area, whether within or outside academia.</p></ol>
             <p>
            <strong>B. Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track</strong></p>
         <p>
            The IGE Track extends the impact of the NRT Traineeship approach to generate other potentially transformative models for improvements in graduate education that prepare STEM graduate students for the full range of possible STEM career paths, as well as prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers who will advance the nation&rsquo;s STEM enterprise. The IGE Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and validating innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required for the customization and implementation of the most successful, transformative ones. The primary target population for IGE projects must be master&rsquo;s and/or doctoral STEM students in a research-based degree program that requires a thesis or dissertation.</p>
      <p>
            The IGE Track will not focus on comprehensive training (see NRT Traineeship track) or foundational research examining how graduate students learn (see EHR Core Research Solicitation 15-509), but rather will promote targeted test-bed efforts that are informed by evidence, including findings from learning-sciences research.</p>
          <p>Activities proposed may include, but are not limited to, student professional skill development, career preparation and vocational counseling, faculty training, inventive partnerships, international experiences, internships, outreach, virtual networks, and mentoring.</p>
     <p>
            <strong>Goals of the IGE Track are to:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Catalyze rapid advances in STEM graduate education broadly as well as those responsive to the needs of particular disciplinary and interdisciplinary STEM fields, and</li>
            <li>Generate the knowledge base needed to inform model implementation and adaptability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The IGE Track calls for proposals to:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design, pilot, and test new, innovative and transformative approaches to STEM graduate education;</li>
            <li>Examine the potential to extend a successful approach developed in one discipline or context to other disciplines, or transfer an evidence-based approach to a new context, and</li>
            <li>Develop test-bed projects that are informed by learning science and the existing body of knowledge about STEM graduate education.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Leadership teams (PI/Co-PIs) comprising professional expertise in the learning sciences and pedagogy, as well as in the principal science domain(s), are strongly encouraged.</p>

        <p><strong>FULL PROPOSAL CONTENT: TRAINEESHIP TRACK</strong></p>
        <p>
          The full proposal must include only the main documents and supplementary documents described in Sections 1-10 below. The page limit for the Project Description is 20 pages. Proposals that are missing required sections and/or exceed the 20-page limit for the Project Description will be returned without review.</p>
          <ol>
        <li><strong>Cover Sheet:</strong> A short informative title that begins either with &ldquo;NRT-DESE:&rdquo;, &ldquo;NRT-UtB:&rdquo;, &ldquo;NRT-INFEWS:&rdquo;, for projects targeting the Data-Enabled Science and Engineering, Understanding the Brain, and Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems research areas, respectively.  Titles for projects addressing another interdisciplinary theme must begin with &ldquo;NRT:&rdquo;. If international activities are proposed, whether or not they will be funded via the NRT award, the international cooperative activities box should be checked and the individual countries listed. For planning purposes, use September 1, 2016 or 2017 as the award start date for projects submitted to the FY2016 and FY2017 competitions, respectively.</li>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Project Summary</strong> (1-page limit): Provide a summary description that addresses the research area and theme, the training plan, and the research-education integration.  The project overview must include the expected number of NRT trainees who will receive an NRT stipend, the number of additional NRT trainees who will not receive an NRT stipend, and the grand total; also specify whether the program will serve master&rsquo;s students, doctoral students, or both. Each NSF merit review criterion (Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts) must be addressed in a separate statement (see Chapter II.C.2 of the GPG for additional instructions). The summary should be written in a manner that will be informative to STEM professionals working in the same or related fields, and understandable to a scientifically literate lay reader.</li>
        <br  />
        <li><strong>Table of Contents:</strong> A table of contents is automatically generated for the proposal by FastLane or Grants.gov and cannot be edited.</li>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Project Description</strong> (20-page limit): The Project Description must contain only Sections 4a through 4j described below with the suggested headings and in the order listed. The Project Description cannot exceed 20 pages, including tables and illustrations. The relative attention given in the proposal narrative to the research and training elements should reflect the principal goal of the NRT program: highly effective training of STEM graduate students in an interdisciplinary research area through a comprehensive traineeship approach that comprises elements that are innovative, evidence -based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.</li>
        <p><strong>4a.  List of Core Participants</strong>: Specify, in tabular form, up to 10 core participants, including the PI, Co- PIs, other faculty and senior personnel, evaluator, and external collaborators. Provide name, project role, departmental and institutional/organizational affiliation, and discipline(s). The evaluator must be one of the 10 core participants. The participants listed should be listed as senior personnel and be the same ones for whom Biographical Sketches and Current and Pending Support information are included later in the proposal.</p>
        <p><strong>4b. Theme, Vision, and Goals:</strong> Describe the overarching theme, vision, and goals of the proposed NRT with a focus on implementing new approaches to training of STEM graduate students in the targeted high priority interdisciplinary research area, through a comprehensive traineeship.  Identify the potential of the NRT project to provide appreciable and meaningful added value to the current degree programs and methods of graduate training at the institution(s). Emphasize the graduate training needs in the project&rsquo;s thematic research field, both at the host institution(s) and nationally. In addition, describe the need for professionals with master&rsquo;s and/or doctoral degrees in the project&rsquo;s thematic research area. Articulate how the proposed NRT project will foster valuable interdisciplinary synergisms emerging from ongoing research activities and/or via NRT-funded initiatives. Describe how the proposed NRT complements and builds on other ongoing or prior institutional efforts to improve STEM graduate education. Proposers should describe how the NRT project would convey benefits to STEM graduate students beyond NRT trainees and how training innovations from the program will be communicated broadly beyond the institution. Address implications of the proposed NRT project for broadening participation.</p>
        <p><strong>4c. Education and Training:</strong> The NRT program focuses on creating innovations in STEM graduate education within a traineeship environment to prepare the scientists and engineers of the future. Describe the adopted traineeship model and its components, including the justification and rationale for their inclusion, and how they are integrated with NRT research activities. The approaches should be innovative, evidence-based, aligned with changing workforce and research needs, transferable, and dedicated to developing versatile STEM professionals. Identify what is lacking in the current approaches to STEM graduate education institutionally and nationally and how the NRT will help meet those needs, both within the participating departments and across the institution(s).</p>
        <p>The proposal should describe the STEM graduate population that will be served. Accordingly, the proposal should specify the anticipated numbers of NRT trainees supported with NRT stipends and those NRT trainees not supported with NRT stipends. An estimate of the number of other STEM graduate students expected to take one or more of the NRT project&rsquo;s elements should also be provided.</p>
        <p>NRT training is expected to span the duration of a student&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s or doctoral program.  Thus, proposals should include a timeline of logically phased, progressive training elements over the degree program(s). Training should be integrated with degree program requirements so that the anticipated time-to-degree is not extended.</p>
        <p>Projects must articulate explicit approaches to provide trainees with training and vocational counseling for both research and research-related careers, within and outside academia; preparation and structured used of individual development plans for trainees is highly recommended. Projects must provide explicit, formal training in technical skills, communication skills, and other transferable professional skills (e.g., project management, leadership, ethics, teaching, entrepreneurship, teamwork, conflict resolution, mentorship, and outreach).</p>
        <p>Improved communication skills is an expected outcome of the NRT program and communication training should include minimum competencies and rubrics for measuring proficiency and progress, and mechanisms for regular, structured feedback to trainees. The communications training should prepare trainees to identify and explain the potential benefits and broader impacts of their research discoveries to a range of stakeholders, including policy makers and the general public.<br />
          <br />
          Collaborations with non-academic partners (e.g., industry, non-government organizations, government agencies, independent laboratories; and research, education, outreach, and informal science centers) are encouraged to promote the trainees&rsquo; professional development. Internships and international experiences are encouraged if they provide marked added value, including authentic mentorship by hosts. If internships are included, proposers should describe pre-internship orientation for trainees and hosts, duration, and expected outcomes. The proposed NRT should foster development of a global perspective, through experiences abroad and/or activities at the home institution(s).<br />
          <br />
          <strong>4d. Major Research Efforts:</strong> Describe the novel, potentially transformative research that the NRT will catalyze through interdisciplinary synergies emerging from currently funded activities at the institution(s) and/or via separate NRT-funded interdisciplinary initiatives. Explain the need for the proposed NRT research and how it would substantially advance, inform, and transform research beyond funded initiatives already underway at the institution(s). NRT funding should be used to complement rather than supplant other research funding.</p>
        <p><strong>4e. Broader Impacts:</strong> The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of how both the training components and the major research efforts will contribute more broadly to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes in the context of NRT include, but are not limited to: development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM; improved STEM education and educator/faculty development; enhanced infrastructure for research and education; increased partnerships and collaborations (both domestic and international) between academia, industry, and others. Proposers should indicate how the project will impact the training of STEM graduate students beyond the disciplines and institutions described in the proposal, contribute to the development and adoption of evidence-based teaching and learning practices, and advance research on effective models for graduate education. For further information see Chapter II.C.2 of the GPG.</p>
        <p><strong>4f. Organization and Management:</strong> Present the plans for the organization and management of the NRT project, including the responsibilities of key personnel and reporting lines. Describe how the leadership team will foster a sense of community among project participants (faculty, trainees, the evaluator, staff, and collaborators) through activities and practices. The PI must possess the scientific, teaching, and mentoring expertise and the project management experience necessary to lead and administer the NRT. Projects should include a half- to full-time NRT Project Coordinator as a member of the management team. Proposers should identify formal mechanisms for recurring, substantive communication with administrators (e.g., department chairs, college deans, graduate school dean(s), and others) about the NRT&rsquo;s progress and any institutional barriers.</p>
        <p>If a collaborative project is proposed, describe the role of the non-lead institution(s) and its (their) participating personnel, the organizational structure(s), and the mechanisms for project communication. A collaborative proposal should be submitted only if the partner institution(s) has (have) a significant role and substantially enhance the training program. Collaborative projects involving trainees at more than a single lead institution should describe practices to ensure that trainees at the participating institution(s) are equal partners, with strong mentorship and comparable access to training activities.</p>
        <p><strong>4g. Recruitment, Mentoring, and Retention:</strong> Describe plans for recruitment, mentoring, and retention of trainees with a particular emphasis on broadening participation of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Underrepresented groups include American Indians/Alaska natives, African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders (native of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa), persons with disabilities, veterans, and/or females. Proposers must provide quantitative data showing the recruitment and retention outcomes of participating departments for the five years preceding the submission date, including time-to-degree completion. Comparisons with national level data are strongly encouraged. The evidence base for the recruiting, mentoring, retention, and broadening participation strategies must be described. Proposers must explain how their processes for admission to the NRT program and their actions to broaden participation will be coordinated with the admissions policies and procedures of the department(s) and university.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4h. Performance Assessment/Project Evaluation:</strong> Assessment of the project is a high priority for the NRT program. Projects should include plans to evaluate the success of the training. In particular, the proposal should identify specific, expected competencies and outcomes along with performance measures and an evaluation timetable. Although the focus should be on trainees, the evaluation plan should also assess how the NRT project affects faculty teaching and research, academic programs, and institutional policies. Assessments should be both formative and summative, and the plan should describe how and when formative assessments would be shared with the project participants, including trainees, and institutional administration. Describe mechanisms for regular feedback from the evaluator and the trainees to the leadership team and how that feedback informs practice. Awardees should be prepared to contribute to NRT program evaluation, including participation in periodic cross-award, joint video conferences to share insights, effective practices, and evaluation findings.</p>
        <p>Institutions are strongly encouraged to secure the services of a professional evaluator unaffiliated with the lead or collaborating institution(s). If an individual or team from the lead or collaborating institution(s) conducts the evaluation, an external evaluator must be employed to provide formal periodic assessments of the ongoing evaluation. The intent is to ensure that the project benefits from an unbiased, external perspective. Proposals should include plans for communicating assessment results, both within the NRT community and more broadly through publications and professional meetings. The lead evaluator must be listed as one of the 10 core participants and their biographical sketch must be provided.</p>
       <p>
          An independent advisory committee comprised of individuals external to the institution(s) is required to provide guidance on a regular basis. The committee should meet regularly to provide advice to the leadership team based on the evaluator&rsquo;s findings and other formal and informal information obtained from the leadership team, other participants, trainees, and administrators.</p>
        <p><strong>4i. Recent Student Training Experiences: </strong>Describe the experience of the PI and Co-PIs with leading or participating in STEM education and training over the past five years. Describe any overlap and/or complementarity between the training and the proposed NRT program.</p>
          <p>
          <strong>4j. Results from Prior NSF Support:</strong> The PI and Co-PIs who have received NSF funding (including any current funding) in the past five years must provide information on the prior award(s), major achievements, and relevance to the proposed NRT project. Individuals who have received more than one prior award must report on the award(s) most closely related to the proposal. Complete bibliographic citation for each publication resulting from an NSF award must be included in either the Results from Prior NSF Support section or in the References Cited section of the proposal. For further information see Chapter II.C.2.d of the GPG.</p>
    
         <li> <strong>References Cited</strong></li><br />
         <li>
          <strong>Biographical Sketches:</strong> Biographical sketches must be provided for the core participants (up to 10) identified in Section 4.a (see above); no additional biographic sketches are permitted.</li><br />
       <li>
          <strong>Budget and Allowable Costs:</strong> Provide an annual budget for up to five years. FastLane or Grants.gov will automatically generate a cumulative budget. The proposed budget can be up to $3,000,000 (maximum) and should be consistent with the costs to develop, offer, administer, and evaluate the program elements (e.g., courses, workshops, internships) and the number of trainees supported financially with NRT stipends or otherwise. Direct costs for explicit trainee support and programmatic elements must be commensurate with the goals specified in the proposal. All travel (both domestic and foreign) must be justified. For further information on allowable costs see Chapter II.C.2.g of the GPG.</li>
     <p>
          <strong>7a. Trainee Support:</strong> Include all trainee support (e.g., stipend, costs of education, travel) as <strong>Participant Support Costs</strong> in the budget.</p>
        <p>NRT stipend and education costs are intended for those trainees (i.e., research-based master's and/or doctoral students) whose research is aligned with the project&rsquo;s research theme. Trainees receiving stipend and cost-of-education support (i.e., NRT-funded trainees) must be full-time students and U.S. citizens or permanent residents.  NSF-funded trainees should receive 12 continuous months of stipend support over an annual period. The NSF <strong>minimum contribution</strong> to NRT stipends is $34,000 per year per NRT-funded trainee for a 12 -month appointment. NRT-funded trainees cannot be charged tuition or any other required costs of education while they are receiving a NRT stipend.  Thus, the budget should include customary costs of education (tuition and required fees) for NRT-funded trainees.</p>
        <p>Additional costs for trainees to participate in programmatic and training elements should be designated as Travel, Subsistence, or Other Participant Support Costs in the budget.</p>
        <p><strong>7b. Faculty/Senior Personnel Salaries:</strong> Salary support must be consistent with contributions to the traineeship. Support for postdoctoral fellows is not allowed unless they explicitly have an instructional or other training role. </p>
      <p>
          <strong>7c. Other Budget Items:</strong> Other budget requests (e.g., non-trainee travel, equipment, and research support) must reflect the training focus of the program, including programmatic elements and non-stipend trainee support. Projects should budget for a half- to full-time NRT Project Coordinator and an evaluator. The budget should include funds for the PI, one trainee, and the Project Coordinator to attend an annual NRT meeting in Washington, DC, plus funds for the PI to attend a one-day orientation meeting for new PIs in Washington, DC during the first year of the project.</p>
         <p>
          Budget Justification (3-page limit): The Budget Justification must clearly explain how funds will be used in direct support of trainees and the traineeship program. For proposals with any subawards, each subaward must include a separate budget justification of no more than three pages.</p>

          <strong>Supplementary Documentation:</strong>
     <strong>Supporting Letters: </strong></li>
   <p>One letter, up to two pages in length, from the appropriate senior university administrator is required and should describe institutional support for the traineeship program and how successful programmatic elements and any associated institutional policies and infrastructure will be sustained after award closure. In addition to the letter from the senior university administrator, up to eight other supporting letters, each one page long, may be provided from partner organizations, including international ones, describing their specific contributions (e.g., internships, mentorship, and laboratory access) to the traineeship.</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborators/Individuals with Conflicts of Interest (a text-searchable single PDF document, to be submitted as an Additional Single Copy Document): </strong>Provide a single list, alphabetically ordered by last name and including institutional affiliation, of conflicts of interest, as specified in NSF's Grant Proposal Guide. The list should include conflicts for each PI, Co-PI, other Senior Personnel, and all sub-awardees who would receive funds through the award. </p>
        <p><strong>Data Management Plan:</strong> All proposals are required to include a Data Management Plan of up to two pages; it should be included as a separate Supplementary Document with Data Management Plan as the heading. The Data Management Plan should describe how the project would conform to the NSF policy on dissemination and sharing of research results as well as any educational products (e.g., curricular materials). This plan will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposal. Data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates, Offices, Divisions, Programs or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>. The PI should follow the data management requirements and plans for the Directorate, Office, Division, Program, or other NSF unit most closely aligned with the research theme of the NRT traineeship. See Chapter II.C.2 of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p>
     <p>
          <strong>Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan:</strong> A Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan is required if postdoctoral fellows receive NRT support, which is allowed only if they participate in an instructional or other training capacity.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
  
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
    
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
