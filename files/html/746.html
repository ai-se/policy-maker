<b>Synopsis of Program:</b> </p>
<div class="user_input"><blockquote>

		<p>The Chemical Bonding Centers (CBC) Program is designed to support the formation of centers that can address major, long-term basic chemical research problems. Appropriate research problems are high-risk but potentially high-impact because they will attract broad scientific and public interest. Centers are expected to be agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities and make full use of cyberinfrastructure to enhance collaborations. Center teams may include researchers from other disciplines and from academia, industry, government laboratories and international organizations. CBCs are expected to integrate research, education, diversity, and outreach. Proposals should contain a compelling strategy for achieving demonstrable impact in all of these areas.</p>
<p>The CBC program is a two-phase program. In the first phase, Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Washington were lead institutions funded by NSF in FY 2004 to explore the development of CBCs. The second phase is to provide funding for implementation of full-scale centers in FY 2007. Only these development teams are eligible to participate in Phase II of the competition by submitting a proposal for the establishment of a full CBC.</p>

<H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3><div class="user_input"><p>The Division of Chemistry is initiating a Phase II competition for Chemical Bonding Centers (CBCs) to capitalize on advances in addressing major intellectual challenges in basic chemical research that were achieved in CBC Phase I projects. These Phase II CBCs will continue to provide the opportunity for especially able and imaginative groups of investigators to share a commitment toward solving a &quot;big problem&quot; in an atmosphere having a high tolerance for risk and within a structure permitting considerable agility. A workshop at NSF, &quot;New Mechanisms for Support of High-Risk and Unconventional Research in Chemistry,&quot; explored mechanisms for encouraging and supporting such initiatives. A report of the workshop can be obtained at <a href="http://www.mrl.uiuc.edu/docs/nsfgmwfinal.pdf">http://www.mrl.uiuc.edu/docs/nsfgmwfinal.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The Division of Chemistry expects to make one or more awards in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 to support Phase II of the Chemical Bonding Centers (CBC) Program. Each Phase II award is expected to have a duration of five years, at a level averaging $3 million per year, with possible renewal for a second five-year period at the same average level of $3 million per year pending availability of funds.</p>
</div>

<a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3><div class="user_input"><p><strong>Background.</strong> The CBC Program is based on a staged competition. Three developmental proposals outlining center&rsquo;s goals were funded in FY 2004 with three-year awards at a level of $500,000 per year. Each of the teams receiving these awards is eligible to participate in Phase II of the competition by submitting a proposal for the establishment of a full CBC.</p>
<p><strong>CBC- II.</strong><strong> </strong> The CBC Program is designed to support the formation of centers that can address major, long-term basic chemical research problems. Appropriate research problems are high-risk but potentially high-impact because they will attract broad scientific and public interest. Centers are expected to be agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities and make full use of cyberinfrastructure to enhance collaborations. Center teams may include researchers from other disciplines and from academia, industry, government laboratories and international organizations. Team sizes will reflect the needs of the problem to be studied, but a minimum of three investigators is required. Team sizes may be different from those in the corresponding CBC Phase I projects.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that successful centers will involve novel research centered in the chemical sciences and aimed at solving high-risk, long-term problems of large scope and impact. It is expected that these CBC Phase II projects will continue the development of new areas of research and new communities of scientists and engineers that were initiated in Phase I. These communities will bring common and complementary interests into productive contact to nurture a culture of risk-taking and innovation around structures that are agile and take full advantage of cyberinfrastructure for fostering collaborations. The awards made under the CBC Program are expected to continue innovative plans to make chemistry and chemists more visible to the broader scientific community and to the public.</p>
<p>CBCs are expected to integrate research and education throughout the course of the project. CBCs should provide novel opportunities for participants to engage in joint efforts that combine education with the excitement of discovery at the frontiers of modern chemical research. CBCs should contain strong diversity and outreach components. There must be a commitment to broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities &ndash; in the solution of these &ldquo;big problems.&rdquo; A vigorous outreach program should be designed to achieve the CBC goal of increasing public appreciation for the contributions of chemistry to progress in modern science.</p>
<p>Examples of possible CBC outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The emergence of new areas of chemical inquiry;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solution of problems
          in basic chemical research beyond the scope of individual investigators
          and/or single disciplines that have broad scientific impact;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emergence
          of innovative, high-risk, cyber-enabled science; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An enhanced favorable
          perception of chemistry and chemists by the broader scientific community
          and by the public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>During preparation of a CBC Phase II proposal, investigators are strongly urged to discuss details with a cognizant Program Officer listed in Section VII of this solicitation. Investigators contemplating the involvement of industrial, government and/or international team members will need to provide an institutional letter of collaboration from the partner organization that confirms the participation of a co-investigator. This letter should be included in the Supplementary Documents Section of the Full Proposal. (See Section V.A., below). The letter should describe the plan of interaction with the U.S. academic institution, the time commitment of the researcher(s), and the nature of the collaborative research activities. Letters of general support or recommendation are inappropriate and may cause a proposal to be returned without review. Cost sharing is not required for Phase II proposals.</p>
<p>Support for collaborations with international scientists is provided through the NSF grant to the submitting U.S. institution. No CBC award funds may go directly to foreign institutions. The proposal may include up to $500,000 in participant support costs, over the duration of the grant, for international collaborative research activities. Travel and incidental research costs may be included; salaries may not. These international collaborations must feature a joint scientific work plan and should be clearly described in the Project Description. If, after review, a proposal is recommended for funding, the cognizant Program Officer will work with Program Officers from the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering and the key project personnel to develop a detailed plan consistent with applicable international arrangements.</p>
<p>Co-investigators associated with entities such as industry, state agencies and national laboratories (Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs)) must be supported by their own organization. However, it is appropriate for students supported through universities to work at a partner industrial laboratory, FFRDC or comparable site, or for universities to fund research expenses incurred when scientists from such entities work at university sites. Federal employees may not receive salaries or in other ways augment their agency's appropriation through grants made by this program, and no funds for major equipment at FFRDC's are allowed.</p>
<p>Principal Investigators should ensure that their proposed project does not substantially overlap with ongoing Federally funded research. Additional information is available through the NSF Guide to Programs (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg</a>). NSF reserves the right to return without review proposals that are not appropriate for the CBC Program.</p>

<h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3><a name="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4><a name="reviewproc"></a>
<P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p><P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsb9772">(NSB 97-72)</a>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </p><P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=iin127">Important Notice 127</a>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding decisions.</p><P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p><P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p><P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p><UL><B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><BR>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</ul><UL><B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><BR>How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</ul><P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<UL>
  <p><I><B>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><BR>
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
      of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities
      it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide
      abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities
      as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint
      efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich
      research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><BR>
      Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
  <p><A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></a> <B>Additional Review Criteria</b>: </p>
  <p>In addition to the National Science Board merit review criteria, reviewers
    will be asked to apply the following criteria when reviewing CBC Phase II
    proposals:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p> Does the proposal present a convincing argument that transition from
        Phase I to Phase II will lead to significant new progress in addressing
        a &quot;big problem&quot;?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Will the project lead to a major advance in
            chemistry and/or at the interface of chemistry and other sciences?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Are
            the scientific goals appropriate for a full-scale CBC?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Does the project
            build upon novel and significant results achieved in Phase I?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Is there
            capacity for agility and evolution as the center develops and matures?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Does
            the project have the potential to attract broad scientific and public
            interest and support?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Will the plans for education, dissemination,
            diversity, outreach, management and use of cyberinfrastructure be
        effective?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Does the proposal have the potential to lead to transformative
            research and innovation in chemistry and related fields?</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </ul><a name="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4> <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal.  Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Panel Review. </p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation, or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3><a name="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>
  Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants 
  Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are 
  declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division 
  administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the 
  reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section 
  VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)
</p> <a name="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<p>Consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-16, <i>Coordination of Geographic Information and Related Spatial Data Activities</i>, and the Federal Geographic Data Committee, all NSF awards that result in relevant geospatial data must be submitted to Geospatial One-Stop in accordance with the guidelines provided at: www.geodata.gov.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <u><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm</a></u>. The GPM is also for sale through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20402. The telephone number at GPO for subscription information is (202) 512-1800.

<a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a>
<a name="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must 
  submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before 
  the end of the current budget period.  
</p><a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
 <p>
  Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final 
  project report.  Failure to provide final 
  technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs.  PIs 
  should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
  required data. 
</p>

<p>
PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. 
  This system permits electronic submission and updating of project reports, including 
  information on project participants (individual and organizational), activities and 
  findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions.   PIs will not be 
  required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in 
  earlier updates using the electronic system.
