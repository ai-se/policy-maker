    RESEARCH EQUIPMENT FUNDING</font>
  <p><font size="4">CHEMICAL &amp; TRANSPORT SYSTEMS DIVISION</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</font><br>
  </p>
</center>



<p>The National Science Foundation provides support for significant research

equipment expenditures through the Major Research Instrumentation Program

administered by the Office of Integrative Activities. Information on the

MRI Program can be obtained via e-mail at <a href="mailto:mri@nsf.gov">mri@nsf.gov</a>

or from the OIA Home Page on the World Wide Web at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/start.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/start.htm</a>.

<p>Research equipment with total cost of less than $200,000 can be funded

by individual or multiple programs within the Chemical &amp; Transport

Systems Division (CTS) of the Engineering Directorate or via joint funding

with programs in other divisions or directorates. Alternative mechanisms

for seeking equipment funding from the CTS Division are described below.

<p><b><font size=+1>1. Include the cost of equipment in a regular unsolicited

proposal for a research grant.</font></b>

<blockquote>
  <p>These proposals will be merit-reviewed in the same manner as other research 
    proposals. Program Directors will make recommendations for funding or declination 
    based on the merit reviews, budget considerations, program balance, and the 
    quality of other proposals being considered for funding. Justification must 
    be provided for the equipment requested. Equipment that will be used by a 
    number of faculty and students and on projects other than the proposed research 
    will be considered favorably; especially for more costly items. One-third 
    institutional cost sharing is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font size=+1>2. Submit a separate equipment proposal to the CTS Division.</font></b> 
</p>
<ol>
  Unsolicited equipment proposals will be merit-reviewed by mail or panel. The 
  Program Directors in six sub-programs (listed below) would prefer to receive 
  such proposals by a target date of January 15 each year. Recommendations for 
  funding or declination will be based on merit reviews, budget considerations, 
  program balance, and the quality of other proposals being considered for funding. 
  The total impact of the equipment requested on related research programs at 
  the grantee institution will be a major consideration in evaluation of "Equipment-Only" 
  proposals. Guidelines for such proposals are given in NSF's Grant Proposal Guide. 
  One-third institutional cost-sharing is required. 
  <p>Programs that accept equipment proposals:</ol>



<ol>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/tttp.htm">Thermal Transport &amp; Thermal 
  Processing</a> <br>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/cps.htm">Combustion &amp; Plasmas Systems</a> 
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/itt.htm">Interfacial, Transport &amp; 
  Thermodynamics</a> <br>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/spp.htm">Separation &amp; Purification 
  Processes</a> <br>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/fdh.htm">Fluid Dynamics &amp; Hydraulics</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.eng.nsf.gov/cts/html/ckm.htm">Kinetics, Catalysis &amp; 
  Molecular Processes</a> 
</ol>

<b><font size=+1>3. Submit a request for a supplement to an existing grant.</font></b>

<ol>
  Proposals for equipment funds up to $25,000 or 20 % of the grant amount, whichever 
  is less, can be submitted in the form of a request for a supplement to an existing 
  grant. Such requests need to clearly delineate the benefits for the current 
  research program and the potential for expanded future utilization.  
  One-third institutional cost-sharing is required. 
</ol>

<br><font size=-1>The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research

and education in most fields of science and engineering.&nbsp; Grantees

are wholly responsible for conducting their project activities and preparing

the results for publication.&nbsp; Thus, the Foundation does not assume

responsibility for such findings or their interpretation.</font>

<p><font size=-1>NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists,

engineers and educators.&nbsp; The Foundation strongly encourages women,

minorities, and persons with disabilities to compete fully in its programs.

financial assistance from NSF (unless otherwise specified in the eligibility

requirements for a particular program).</font>

<p><font size=-1>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities 
  (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons

the review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain

data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration

of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers

and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government

agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order
