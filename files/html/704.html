<h3>REVISION NOTES</h3>
<p><strong>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG)<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf091">NSF 09-1</a>, was issued on October 1, 2008 and is effective for proposals submitted on or after January 5, 2009. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf091">NSF 09-1</a> apply to proposals submitted in response to this funding opportunity.

<p><strong>One of the most significant changes to the PAPPG is implementation of the mentoring provisions of the America COMPETES Act.  Each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a separate section within the 15-page project description, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.  Proposals that do not include a separate section on mentoring activities within the Project Description will be returned without review (see the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> Chapter II.C.2.d for further information).</strong></p>
<p><strong>LSAMP:</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in FY2008, requests for Bridge to the Doctorate (BD)  support must be submitted as new proposals via FastLane. Supplemental  requests to existing cooperative agreements will be returned.</p>
<p><strong>AGEP:</strong></p>
<p>A recurring date for AGEP Letters of Intent (LOIs) has been instituted.  AGEP LOIs are due on the last Friday in May.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The Alliances for Broadening Participation in STEM (ABP) solicitation includes the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity, and the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portfolio seeks to increase the number of students successfully completing quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).&nbsp; Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative academic strategies and experiences in support of groups that historically have been underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Alaskan Natives, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>Managed synergistically, the ABP cluster enables seamless transitions from the STEM baccalaureate to attainment of the doctorate and entry to the STEM professoriate.&nbsp; ABP support begins at the baccalaureate level through the LSAMP program.&nbsp; LSAMP emphasizes development of broad based regional and national alliances of academic institutions, school districts, state and local governments, and the private sector to increase the diversity and quality of the STEM workforce.&nbsp; Eligible LSAMP undergraduate students may receive continued support for up to two additional years of STEM graduate study through the Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity.&nbsp; The Bridge to the Doctorate provides significant financial support for matriculating candidates in STEM doctoral programs at eligible alliance sites.</p>
<p>Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) furthers the graduate education of underrepresented students through the doctorate level, preparing them for fulfilling opportunities and productive careers as STEM faculty and research professionals.&nbsp; AGEP also supports the transformation of institutional culture to attract and retain STEM doctoral students into the professorate.</p>
<p>The LSAMP program also supports education research projects focused on STEM baccalaureate degree attainment.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) serves as the focal point for NSF&rsquo;s agency-wide commitment to broadening participation of all individuals in STEM. HRD programs reflect NSF's commitment to developing the resources of the scientific and technological community as a whole and ensuring an adequately trained research and development workforce. To meet the challenges presented by the Nation's increasing reliance on science and technology, the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) programs support efforts to strengthen the STEM education capabilities of participating institutions. In doing so, these programs help to fulfill an important outcome goal of the NSF Strategic Plan (FY 2006-2011):&nbsp; to cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.</p>
<p>More broadly, HRD programs, including the LSAMP and AGEP programs, the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering Program (GSE), Research in Disabilities Education (RDE), the Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUP) Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate (HBCU-UP) Program, and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) provide coordinated and integrated approaches to developing and leveraging individual talents and institutional infrastructures. Managed synergistically, these programs enable successful transitions from associate and baccalaureate-level study to the attainment of masters and doctoral degrees. Such efforts serve to increase the number of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities well prepared for the STEM workforce of the future.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>ABP programs provide complementary support to institutions of higher education in an effort to increase baccalaureate and advanced degree attainment in STEM fields, particularly among underrepresented populations.&nbsp; Program goals are accomplished principally through the formation of alliances among institutions of higher education and between academe, industry and the community.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCES FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION (LSAMP)</strong></p>
<p>LSAMP program supports sustained and comprehensive approaches to broadening participation at the baccalaureate level. These approaches facilitate the production of students who are well prepared in STEM and motivated to pursue graduate education. Projects place emphasis on aggregate baccalaureate production; attention to individual student retention and progression to baccalaureate degrees; aggregation of student progression to graduate school entry and institutionalizing, disseminating and promoting the replication of strategies and collaborative approaches proven successful to transition undergraduate STEM students to graduate STEM programs.</p>
<p>LSAMP activities must produce a demonstrable &quot;near-term&quot; increase in the numbers of STEM graduates and the promise of long-term change in the production of new Ph.D.s and their entrance into productive faculty or research careers. The strategy for implementing these projects must be clear and focused.</p>
<p>LSAMP alliances must be structured to address two interrelated requirements:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>First, the design of the alliance must be based on sound understanding of programmatic approaches known to be successful in meeting well-defined needs, must be cost effective, and must involve undergraduates in faculty research.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Second, the proposed plan must be comprehensive and longitudinal, since fragmented or isolated efforts provide insufficient responses to the acknowledged scope and scale of the problem being addressed by the LSAMP program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful programmatic approaches include, but are not limited to: (1) devoting careful attention to management and administrative collaboration among participating organizations so as to ensure long-term continuation of LSAMP or similar activities beyond the term of NSF financial support; and (2) developing specific evaluation plans and procedures for assessing qualitative and quantitative changes including the definition of a baseline of pre-LSAMP data which will be used to compare post-LSAMP retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM fields.</p>
<p>Comprehensive and longitudinal plans are reflected in: (1) the establishment of alliances with members drawn from among community colleges, colleges and universities, school systems, Federal/state/local government agencies, major national laboratories and centers, industry, private foundations, and professional STEM organizations, as necessary to achieve the proposed LSAMP objectives; (2) incorporation of academic, curricular, and co-curricular enrichment activities designed to improve instructional performance as well as increase the motivation, performance, and progression of talented students within undergraduate degree programs and in preparation for graduate degree programs; and (3) direct student support as necessary to enable students to attend academic year and summer enrichment activities.</p>
<p>LSAMP provides latitude to proposers in designing projects to achieve the stated LSAMP goals. The structure and content of proposed projects should be governed by differences in the institutional and organizational capabilities of alliance members, strategies for the formation of the alliance, and characteristics of specific localities. Project specifics may encompass a wide variety of activities. The project activities must form a feasible, logical, and comprehensive effort focused upon improving the undergraduate educational experience. While the primary focus of LSAMP is at the undergraduate level, projects must include activities that affect student advancement through one or more of the critical transition points during STEM education: from high school to college, between 2- and 4-year college, from undergraduate study to the workplace, from undergraduate to graduate school, and from graduate school to faculty. These activities allow the LSAMP program to build linkages between the various sectors of the STEM community and the educational process to increase the flow of students and their advancement rate.</p>
<p>The following are specific requirements for support under the LSAMP program.&nbsp; Proposals will be evaluated on their potential to increase minority participation in STEM disciplines.&nbsp; Thus, NSF requires potential awardees to rigorously evaluate students&rsquo; participation in LSAMP activities.</p>
<p>First time applicants must focus on baccalaureate production of underrepresented minorities in STEM and must define their current baseline production of baccalaureate recipients in STEM fields.&nbsp; All applicants must commit to a significant increase in baccalaureate production in STEM fields within a five-year award period and make a compelling case for the level of increase they define as significant.&nbsp; Subsequent support will be contingent on evidence of success in areas of individual student recruitment, retention and progression to baccalaureate degrees. <em><strong> Note:&nbsp; NSF approved original baseline goals may be adjusted through additions and/or reductions in alliance membership.&nbsp; A clear plan of action to significantly increase individual STEM students, rather than simply aggregate students, toward baccalaureate degree attainment is essential for a successful proposal.</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition to the above, proposals from previously funded alliances must include a plan to achieve institutionalization&nbsp; of effective pathways to STEM graduate study and careers for baccalaureate recipients at participating institutions.&nbsp; Entities seeking further support opportunities should refer to the eligibility guidelines for post-baccalaureate funding opportunities under the &quot;Bridge to the Doctorate (BD)&quot; and &quot;Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate&quot; sections of this solicitation.</p>
<p>LSAMP awards will not exceed $1.0 million per year.&nbsp; (See eligibility guidelines for the Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) activities under &quot;Other Funding Opportunities&quot; in the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation section.)</p>
<p>LSAMP awards will be managed through Cooperative Agreements for up to 5 years.&nbsp; Progress will be assessed annually prior to continued NSF support.&nbsp; LSAMP projects nearing the completion of the five-year funding period may submit a competitive renewal proposal for an additional five years of support.&nbsp; The LSAMP program will ensure that each awardee alliance is funded in a cost-efficient manner through adherence to the following guidance:</p>
<p><em><strong>NEW ALLIANCES</strong></em></p>
<p>Alliances are considered new if they have not received previous LSAMP funds and meet the criteria for a LSAMP partnership alliance described under &quot;eligible organizations&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The president, provost or designee of the lead institution of a prospective new alliance <strong>must </strong>contact the NSF LSAMP program for guidance prior to submitting a proposal for funding.</p>
<p>Guidelines for requesting funds for new alliances are indicated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$700,000 to $1,000,000 per year for alliances that award more than 500 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually;</li>
    <li>Approximately $500,000 to $700,000 per year for alliances that award between 300-500 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually; and,</li>
    <li>$500,000 or less per year for alliances that award fewer than 300 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>MID-LEVEL ALLIANCES</strong></em></p>
<p>Alliances are considered at mid-level if they have received previous LSAMP support and (1) focus on the recruitment and retention of freshmen and sophomore students in STEM disciplines or (2) support early interventions for the retention of upper level students with an emphasis on graduate matriculation.</p>
<p>Funding guidelines for mid-level alliances are stipulated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$700,000 per year for alliances that award 700 or more STEM baccalaureate degrees annually;</li>
    <li>Approximately $500,000 to $700,000 per year for alliances that award between 500-700 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually; and,</li>
    <li>$500,000 or less per year for alliances that award fewer than 500 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>SENIOR-LEVEL ALLIANCES</strong></em></p>
<p>Alliances are considered senior-level if they received previous LSAMP support and focus on persistence and attention to graduate study, institutionalization of successful policies and procedures for attainment of the degree, community college interventions, and international activities.&nbsp; Senior level alliances are also eligible for Bridge to the Doctorate support.</p>
<p>Funding guidelines for senior-level alliances are provided as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$500,000 per year for projects that award 1,000 or more STEM baccalaureate degrees annually;</li>
    <li>Approximately $300,000 to 500,000 per year for projects that currently award between 700-1,000 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually; and,</li>
    <li>$300,000 or less per year for projects that award fewer than 700 STEM baccalaureate degrees annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alliances at each level are expected to continue to nurture, sustain, and institutionalize basic activities and practices which demonstrate proven success in improving the quality and numbers of underrepresented minority students matriculating in STEM disciplines.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Requested financial support should be clearly justified along with established recruitment, selection and accountability criteria.&nbsp; Allowable student support is limited to financial support for employing team building principles (e.g., mentoring, collaborative learning experiences, small group clustering in academic sections, structured work-study groups), individual skill development (e.g., participation in special seminars and colloquia), involvement in research (e.g., stipends or salary for academic-year or summer research programs, and related personal career counseling and mentoring), preparation for graduate school application and success, and other activities designed to enhance student experiences and student/faculty/mentor interaction.</p>
<p>LSAMP may provide supplements to enable direct support for students to attend summer enrichment activities and to participate in other activities throughout the academic year.&nbsp; See section under &quot;Other Funding Opportunities Through the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation&quot; for additional information.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCES FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
<li><strong> Bridge to the Doctorate (BD)</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>LSAMP alliances at the senior level are eligible for Bridge to the Doctorate support.&nbsp; BD funding provides financial support for eligible students for two years of graduate study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposals for BD support must describe effective strategies for recruiting, retaining, educating and graduating the participants. Proposers must provide documentation of past performance at the designated graduate institutional site of retaining, graduating, and placing significant numbers of LSAMP graduates into doctoral-degree programs. A plan for formally connecting a significant number of newly matriculated LSAMP students, including master's degree graduates, to doctoral degree programs is expected.</p>
<p>Successful projects must demonstrate substantive and formal connection to other NSF-funded programs, such as CREST, NSF research centers, Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training Program (IGERT), Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education Program (GK-12), and AGEP.&nbsp; Successful BD projects must ensure that a substantive number of first year BD participants apply to NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).&nbsp; Similarly, BD applicants must present an action plan describing dollar support and sources for continuing students in years three and beyond towards doctorate degrees.&nbsp; Action plans identifying strategies for connecting the transfer of third-year BD recipients interested in and eligible for admission to AGEP graduate programs are required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recruitment of students is expected from all STEM disciplines.&nbsp; A concentration of students in one discipline within a cohort is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Tracking of project participants into doctoral degree programs and into the workforce, including the professoriate is also expected. Other highly valued activities include regular BD meetings, mentoring of students, and resources to support annual student participation at professional meetings and seminars on productive academic efforts, demystify degree programs, and available career options. A critical mass of twelve (12) LSAMP STEM graduate students is required under this activity.</p>
<p>The NSF contribution to graduate student stipends is $30,000 per year (12 months) for each of twelve students for 24-months. Successfully matriculating graduate students are expected to receive a second year stipend at this dollar support level.</p>
<p>NSF will provide a cost-of-education allowance to the institution for tuition, health insurance, and other normal fees of $10,500 per year up to two years for each of twelve students.&nbsp; Costs for project evaluation may be included.&nbsp; A flat allowance of $15,000 per award may also be requested in lieu of indirect costs.&nbsp; The maximum request per alliance is $987,000.</p>
<p>Graduate stipends should be listed on Line F, &quot;Participant Support,&quot; on the proposal budget.&nbsp; <strong>All stipend recipients funded under this supplement must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; Beginning in FY2008, requests for BD support must be submitted as a new proposal in FastLane.&nbsp; Supplemental requests will be returned without review.&nbsp; BD proposals must be submitted by the lead institution of the LSAMP alliance.&nbsp; Successful proposals will be awarded as two-year standard grants.&nbsp; <em><strong>Residual funds from BD grants may not be reallocated to other cohorts.</strong></em>&nbsp; Annual and final reporting requirements are applicable for new BD awards.</p>

<ol start="2" type="A">
<li><strong> Educational Research Projects</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>LSAMP alliance member institutions are eligible to submit proposals for educational research projects focused on baccalaureate attainment in STEM by African Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Proposals for LSAMP educational research projects should be based on a research design that incorporates appropriate and proven methodologies and strategies to (1) identify the research questions, (2) implement the collection and analysis of data, and (3) interpret the resulting measures and findings generated by the study. The results should provide convincing evidence of factors (including departmental- and institution-level) facilitating increased minority undergraduate access to STEM careers, including minority baccalaureate degree attainment and persistence of these traditionally underrepresented groups to STEM graduate study. Results should provide educators with practical and successful strategies to promote broader adoption or adaptation of the recommended practices within their educational systems (departments, institutions, alliances).</p>
<p>LSAMP educational research studies should reflect explicit cognizance of the broad variety of institutions of higher education involved and should address the unique challenges and opportunities posed by that variety. Outcomes of the proposed research should be developed with the intent to inform the education community, including faculty, administrators, policymakers, and parents, enabling them to better guide the future development of learning experiences, and foster the retention, and academic success of diverse students in STEM.</p>
<p>Education research projects will be supported at the level of $100,000 per year for up to 12 months.&nbsp; Eligible institutions may submit no more than one proposal per competition.</p>
<p>Requests for support for research projects must be submitted separately in the FastLane or Grants.gov systems.&nbsp; The ABP solicitation number should be referenced.&nbsp; Titles should begin with the words &quot;LSAMP Research Project:&quot; and be submitted on or before October 10, 2008.</p>
<p>Additional funding opportunities for broader educational research topics in student learning, recruitment, retention, persistence to degree, and other STEM educational research for underrepresented minority populations are available throughout the Foundation.&nbsp; Please refer to the NSF Website for additional information.</p>

<li><strong>NSF-DoE Cooperative Activity</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Supplemental funding through the LSAMP program may be requested for student and faculty support in FY08 and FY09 (subject to the availability of funds) for summer undergraduate research experiences at the Department of Energy laboratories.&nbsp; Only alliances with active LSAMP awards are eligible to submit requests for funding.&nbsp; For fiscal 2008, supplemental requests are due on or before March 8, 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information on this funding opportunity, please refer to NSF 07-133 &quot;Cooperative Activity with Department of Energy Programs for Education and Human Resource Development&quot; (Dear Colleague Letter)</p>
<p><strong>RIGOROUS PROJECT EVALUATION</strong></p>
<p>It is expected that each LSAMP and BD proposal submission include plans for rigorous project evaluation.&nbsp; This evaluation should be the basis for strengthening implementation over the course of the project and for annual reporting to NSF that will be used to justify continued investment in the project. Proposals should provide objectives, benchmarks, and indicators of progress that will inform reviewers of the proposers' understanding of essential factors for judging accountability, both quantitative (minority enrollment and Ph.D. production) and qualitative (the process of change in organizational culture).</p>
<p align="center"><strong>ALLIANCES FOR GRADUATE EDUCATION AND THE PROFESSORIATE (AGEP).</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the AGEP program is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing advanced study, obtaining doctoral degrees, and entering the professorate in STEM disciplines (including social sciences). Alliances participating in this program are expected to engage in comprehensive institutional cultural changes that will lead to sustained increases in the conferral of STEM doctoral degrees, significantly exceeding historic levels of performance.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of AGEP are: (1) to develop and implement innovative models for recruiting, mentoring, and advancing minority students in STEM doctoral programs, and (2) to develop effective strategies for identifying and supporting underrepresented minorities who want to pursue academic careers.</p>
<p><strong>ALLIANCES</strong></p>
<p>Alliances consisting of two or more doctoral degree granting institutions serving the STEM graduate education needs are eligible to submit proposals. One institution must be designated as the lead institution for the project. Institutions in the U.S. and its territories having documented success in translating minority matriculates into degree recipients are strongly encouraged to participate. A single institution may participate in only one alliance. Through the alliance, it is anticipated that the strengths of the respective individual institutions will be maximized to serve AGEP goals. Alliance commitment will be assessed with respect to willingness and ability of participating institutions to align relevant financial and operational resources to the goals articulated by this program. To ensure commitment and the potential for success, the Provost or Graduate Dean of the lead institution should serve as the Principal Investigator (PI). A full explanation should be provided for a PI designation in variance with this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these awards is to catalyze changes in institutional, departmental, and organizational culture and practices that will result in significant increases in the recruitment, retention, degree conferral, and STEM career (especially academic) entry of underrepresented minority students. The proposal should clearly describe strategies to ensure effective recruitment, mentoring, retention, and degree completion of underrepresented minority students. Strategies may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for students to attend conferences,</li>
<li>coordinated recruitment among partner institutions,</li>
<li>proactive use of faculty in student recruitment,</li>
<li>development of systemic mentoring and mentor training,</li>
<li>faculty and student exchange programs,</li>
<li>specific preparation for the professoriate, and</li>
<li>more effective career counseling and career placement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In support of the activities described above, the program provides funding in a variety of cost categories, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>provision for faculty release time,</li>
<li>program coordination and clerical support (partial),</li>
<li>special workshop/seminar support costs,</li>
<li>faculty/student travel between institutions (e.g., recruitment, joint research, etc.)</li>
<li>peer mentoring stipends, and</li>
<li>evaluation and assessment costs (partial).</li>
</ul>
<p>Under AGEP, NSF intends to support a portfolio of projects that serve as effective models for addressing these issues. Proposals should clearly describe strategies for increasing minority student admissions; for creating supportive environments for these students at both the institutional and departmental levels; as well as for developing student interest in, and preparation for, academic careers (teaching and other faculty roles). Relevant strategies may include, for example, developing partnerships with undergraduate institutions that produce large numbers of minority STEM majors (e.g., Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs)); providing underrepresented minority undergraduates with enriched academic and research experiences that place strong emphasis on obtaining doctorates and pursuing academic careers; and/or developing student networks or mentoring programs at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels. Proposed projects must demonstrate substantive linkages with other NSF-funded programs within alliance institutions (i.e., LSAMP, HBCU-UP, TCUP, CREST, NSF research centers, ADVANCE, IGERT and GK-12) projects.&nbsp; The activities described are illustrative of the broad range of activities that are possible under AGEP.</p>
<p>In an effort to provide more direct connectivity between the AGEP program and the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity, all AGEP proposals must describe plans for proactive recruitment of BD graduates into appropriate AGEP doctoral programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project strategies that do not specifically address the AGEP goals will not be considered competitive. The AGEP program stresses the building of a well-documented knowledge base of successful strategies.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINES</strong></p>
<p>Projects involving any of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields normally supported by NSF are eligible.&nbsp; Projects are expected to be comprehensive, broadly covering STEM (and SBE) departments. All participating departments must be explicitly identified in the proposal. Multiple STEM departments must be involved at AGEP institutions, and additional departments can be transitioned in over the 5-year cooperative agreement.&nbsp; It is critical that the administrative infrastructure to implement AGEP be clearly described.&nbsp; It is also critical that plans for institutionalization of AGEP-funded activities be clearly articulated.</p>
<p><strong>RIGOROUS PROJECT EVALUATION</strong></p>
<p>It is expected that each AGEP project will complement its efforts with its own formative evaluation. This evaluation should be the basis for strengthening implementation over the course of the project and for annual reporting to NSF that will be used to justify continued investment in the project. Proposals should provide suggestions of objectives, benchmarks, and indicators of progress that will inform reviewers of the proposers' understanding of essential factors for judging accountability, both quantitative (minority enrollment and Ph.D. production) and qualitative (the process of change in organizational culture). This evaluation must show an effective process by which student progress will be assessed on an annual basis. Indicators of cultural changes include changes in policies, practices, and programs at the graduate school office or departmental levels. Changes can occur with student recruitment, admissions, and selection processes, academic support, and socialization to profession.</p>
<p><strong>RIGOROUS PROGRAM EVALUATION</strong></p>
<p>Awardees will be required to participate in a program-level evaluation by which NSF can assess quantitative gains in relevant measures for underrepresented minority students and make qualitative assessments of the process of change. Shortly after awards have been made, project evaluators may be asked to assist NSF contractors in developing a program evaluation that will mutually benefit the agency and project participants. AGEP projects are expected to have the capability of collecting and analyzing data derived from program evaluation activities. AGEP projects must set (and meet) measurable goals and collect evidence (disaggregated by ethnicity, gender, and discipline) to determine progress toward the AGEP goal of significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minorities attaining doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines. Evaluation programs should also measure early career progression of doctoral recipients.</p>
<p><strong>ALLOWABLE STUDENT SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>Student support is allowable, but AGEP is not intended to be a single fellowship program. If financial support is requested, proposals must clearly explain the need being addressed, as well as student recruitment, selection and accountability criteria. Allowable student support is generally limited to financial support for employing team building principles (e.g., collaborative learning experiences, small group clustering in academic sections, structured work-study groups), individual skill development (e.g., participation in special seminars and colloquia), involvement in research (e.g., stipends or salary for academic-year or summer research programs, and related personal career counseling and mentoring), and other activities designed to enhance student experiences and student/faculty/mentor interaction. AGEP will also provide participant support to enable students to attend summer enrichment activities and to participate in other activities throughout the academic year. Please note that student support can only be provided to U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent U.S. residents.</p>
<p><strong>PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>To aid reviewers in assessing past performance of proposing institutions, proposals should include the following baseline data over the past five year period (for U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent U.S. residents only):</p>
<ol>
<li> The sum and the average of the numbers of minority Ph.D. conferrals per year as well as the sum and the averages of minority graduate enrollments for each NSF-supported department, disaggregated by gender and by population subgroup (e.g., African American, Hispanic, and Native American),</li>
<li>Annual total and minority baccalaureate and master's degree conferrals for departments of the submitting alliance institutions.</li>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a></h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>For proposals to the LSAMP Program, additional review criteria will apply in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA FOR LSAMP AND BD PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the standard NSF review criteria of demonstrating intellectual merit and broader impacts of the project, reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals in terms of linkages to other NSF programs and plans for rigorously evaluating the projects or programs over the duration of the grant period.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using the following program specific review criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Linkages:</strong>&nbsp; Proposals should clearly demonstrate linkages to other NSF-funded programs and the benefits to alliance students and faculty.&nbsp; For projects with BD funding, reviewers will be instructed to evaluate evidence of formal connections and involvement with AGEP institutions as well as the continuation of these connections through the STEM doctoral degree.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong>&nbsp; Proposals will be evaluated on the rigor of the evaluation plan.&nbsp; Reviewers will be tasked to assess the adequacy of resources to implement a rigorous evaluation over the duration of the award period as well as the usefulness of the anticipated outcomes to the body of knowledge in transforming student learning, recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines and into the workforce.</p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<p><a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a></p>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<p><a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a></p>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at<br> 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at<br> 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong><span>
										&nbsp;In addition to general terms and conditions, special award conditions may be included in the cooperative agreements.&nbsp;For Bridge to the Doctorate awards,&nbsp;residual funds from standard grants may not be reallocated to other cohorts.</span></p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a></p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>
<p><span><strong>For LSAMP Alliances Only:&nbsp; </strong>All alliances are required to report enrollment, degree data and other data annually via the WebAMP reporting system.</span></p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
