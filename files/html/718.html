<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) awards Postdoctoral Fellowships to highly qualified investigators within 3 years of obtaining their PhD to carry out an integrated program of independent research and education. The research and education plans of each fellowship must address scientific questions within the scope of EAR disciplines.&nbsp; The program supports researchers for a period of up to 2 years with fellowships that can be taken to the institution or national facility of their choice. The program is intended to recognize young investigators of significant potential, and provide them with experience in research and education that will establish them in leadership positions in the Earth Sciences community. Because the fellowships are offered only to postdoctoral scientists early in their career, doctoral advisors are encouraged to discuss the availability of EAR fellowships with their graduate students early in their doctoral programs. Fellowships are awards to individuals, not institutions, and are administered by the Fellows.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) offers 2-year postdoctoral fellowships to provide opportunities for scientists early in their careers to obtain training beyond their graduate education. The postdoctoral fellowship program is intended to recognize beginning investigators of significant potential, and provide them with experience in research and education that will establish them in positions of leadership in the scientific community. During the tenure of the fellowships, participants will be conducting research on topics supported by EAR and developing a coherent educational plan. Projects may employ any combination of field, laboratory, and computational studies with observational, theoretical, or experimental approaches. Fellows must affiliate with appropriate research institutions and are expected to devote themselves full time to the fellowship activities during its term.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<ol start="1" type="A">
  <li> Appropriateness for EAR priorities</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>An integrated research and education plan whose focus falls within the scope
    of any of the EAR disciplines is eligible for support. EAR focuses on improving
    our understanding of the Earth&rsquo;s structure, composition, evolution, and the interaction with the Earth&rsquo;s
    biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. If your research area is in a discipline
    not funded by EAR or if you are uncertain, you are strongly encouraged to
    contact the cognizant program officer to discuss the appropriateness of the
    research.</p>
  <p>In addition, fellowship applicants are expected to include a coherent program of educational activities as part of their proposal. Examples of such activities include teaching one course each year of the fellowship at their host institution or an academic institution with ties to their host institution, developing educational materials for formal or informal education venues, or engaging in a significant program of outreach or public education. As a rough guideline, fellows should plan on their educational activities taking up no less than 10% and no more than 25% of their time. Applicants are encouraged to discuss the proposed educational activities with their proposed host institution prior to proposal submission to ensure that their educational plan is consistent with opportunities and plans at the institution.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="A">
  <li> Location of Work</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Research and education activities supported by this fellowship program may be conducted at any appropriate U.S. or foreign host institution. Appropriate institutions include colleges and universities, private nonprofit institutes and museums, government installations and laboratories. Fellows are expected to be fully integrated into the educational and research activities of their host institution. The justification of the choice of institutions must be made clearly and compellingly in the proposal.</p>
  <p>The applicant may propose to take the fellowship to more than one host institution. Normally changes of institution would be sequential, moving from one institution to another during the duration of the fellowship, but holding the fellowship at two institutions simultaneously, for example at a national center and a nearby university, is also possible. For the latter case, a single institution must be designated by the applicant to receive the institutional allowance. The applicant must present a coherent research and educational plan throughout the proposed duration of the fellowship.</p>
  <p>Because the objectives of the fellowships include broadening the perspectives and experiences of the Fellows and promoting interdisciplinary research careers, careful consideration should be given to the selection of the sponsoring scientists and host institutions.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="A">
  <li> The Sponsoring Scientist(s)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Fellow must affiliate with a host institution(s) at all times during the entire tenure of the fellowship and select a sponsoring scientist(s) who will provide mentoring and guidance with the research and education activities. In addition, the sponsoring scientist must design a training program for the Fellow. The applicant is responsible for making prior arrangements with the host institution and sponsoring scientist(s). If more than one sponsor is proposed, one must be named lead sponsor and the roles of the other sponsors must be clearly stated in the project description. An important basis for judging the suitability of the host institution is the degree to which the institution letter describes and offers a research, education, and mentoring plan that could not be provided without fellowship support. (See Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions for additional information about the institution letter.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
<p><a name="awd_txt" id="awd_txt"></a>  </p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
  <li> Duration and Tenure:  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p> Support may be requested for periods of up to 24 continuous months. Tenure
    begins on the first of the month only and may commence at the Fellow&#146;s
    request between June 1 and January 1 following review of the proposal, which
    occurs within 6 months of the proposal deadline. Interruptions in tenure
    or extensions without additional cost to NSF are permitted only for extenuating
    circumstances beyond the control of the Fellow. Fellowships are not renewable.</p>
  <p>Those applicants selected to receive fellowships will be contacted by NSF and asked to provide additional information, such as completing acceptance forms and starting certificates, before starting their fellowships. Successful applicants who have not completed their PhD at the time of application must provide certification of the receipt of the PhD before receiving their fellowship award. Normally fellowships will be held at institutions specified in the proposal, but under certain circumstances, and with suitable justification, Fellows may transfer during the tenure of the fellowship to a new institution upon approval by NSF.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="A">
  <li> Stipend and Allowances:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The total fellowship amount is $80,000 per year consisting of four components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p> A stipend is $55,000 per year paid monthly at the rate of $4,585 directly
        to the fellow as an electronic funds transfer into a personal account
        at a financial institution; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An allowance of $15,000 per year is paid
        as a lump sum to the fellow at the beginning of the fellowship to support
        research and education activities; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An annual host institutional allowance
        of $3,000, paid to the host institution upon request for expenses incurred
        in support of the fellow, such as office space, general-purpose supplies
        and use of equipment, facilities and other institutional resources;</p>
    </li>
    <li>      An
        annual benefit allowance of $7,000, paid either to the fellow or the
        host institution in support of fringe benefits, including health insurance
        provided through either a group plan offered by the host organization
        or an individual plan secured by the fellow, dental and/or vision insurance,
        disability insurance, retirement, dependent care, and moving expenses. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>No additional appointment or fellowship may be held during the period of the fellowship. No other remuneration from any source may be accepted during the period of the fellowship without permission of the program officer.</p>

    Other Direct Costs; enter these allowances as a sum total of $10,000 in G.6
    (FastLane) or F.8 (Grants.gov). A budget justification of no more than two
    pages should document and justify the estimated costs as organized in the
    budget components described above.</li>
  <li>Current and Pending Support. Include current
    and planned applications to other fellowship programs. </li>
  <li> The letter of commitment, as described below, is considered to be Supplementary
    Documentation and is the only item permitted as supplementary documentation
    or appendices: <br>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The letter of commitment from the prospective host institution
        should be signed by both the department chair (or equivalent) and
        the proposed sponsoring scientist;</li>
                <li>The letter should certify that the applicant's proposal has
                  been read and approved by the proposed scientific mentor;</li>
                <li>That adequate facilities and support will be provided for the
                  fellow;</li>
                <li> The letter should include a discussion of the role the proposed
                  scientific mentor will play in the professional development
                  of the fellow, and of the opportunities for training and research
                  at the host institution that will be of particular benefit
                  to the fellow.</li>
                <li>Should the applicant propose to hold the fellowship at more
                  than one institution through the 2-year tenure, letters of commitment
                  must be provided for all institutions involved;</li>
                <li>Since this program relies on reviewed proposals rather than
                  applications, letters of recommendation will not be considered.
                  Thus the letter of commitment from the institution should not
                  constitute a letter of recommendation;<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
            </ol>
    </li><li>Some proposals may require
    other documentation before the final decision can be made, e.g.,
    government permits and letters of collaboration. Their existence
    should be noted in the project description but they should not
    be included in the application. NSF may request them later.</li>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
  (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
  of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
  criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
  and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to
    advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different
    fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct
    the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the
    prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore
    creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
    activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How
    well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports
    at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities
    where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators,
    and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education
    with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
    learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects,
    and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
    is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is
    committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p> In addition to the above criteria, the following factors will be used in
  the evaluation process:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Qualifications of the applicant and his/her potential for continued professional growth and leadership in the field;</li>
    <li>Qualifications and suitability of the proposed host institution and the scientific and educational collaborations proposed;</li>
    <li>Prospective benefits to the applicant, the scientific discipline, and the activities of the host institution.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong>
<span>
										The fellowship award is made to the individual,
										not the institution. Payments (except the institutional allowance)
										are made to the individual. Awards cannot be extended without prior
										NSF approval. Pre-award costs are not permitted.
										<p>Candidates selected to receive fellowships will be contacted by NSF and asked to provide additional information, such as acceptance forms and starting certificates, before starting their fellowships. Successful candidates who have not completed their doctoral degrees at the time of application must provide certifications of the receipt of the PhD before receiving a fellowship award.</p>
<p>Normally fellowships will be held at the host institution(s) specified in the proposal; however, under certain circumstances and with suitable justification, fellowships may be transferred to a new organization upon approval by NSF.</p>
<p>No additional appointment or fellowship may be held during the period of the fellowship. No other remuneration from any source may be accepted during the period of the fellowship without permission of the program officer.</p>
<p>Candidates are encouraged to discuss institutional policies on intellectual property rights with the host organization(s) before submitting the proposal. Candidates should also discuss the policies of the sponsoring scientist(s) regarding which materials will remain with the host organization(s) and which can be released to the Fellow at the conclusion of the fellowship.</p>
<p>Fellows are required to adhere to the EAR Data Policy available on the NSF website. Final reports for all awards should include a statement describing how the data policy requirements have been met.</p></span><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available
  through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project
  reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
  project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other
  specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter
  information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
  using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes
  certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.<span>
											&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><strong>Additional Reporting Requirements:</strong> Fellows must file
  termination certificates in addition to annual and final reports.</p></span><a name="cont" id="cont"></a>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
