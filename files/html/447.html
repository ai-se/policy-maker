        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The intent of this solicitation is to request proposals from organizations willing to serve as Resource Providers within the NSF eXtreme Digital (XD) program.  The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by exploring new and creative approaches to delivering innovative computational resources to an increasingly diverse community and portfolio of scientific research and education. </p>
            <p>NSF's vision for Advanced Computing Infrastructure, which supports Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Science and Engineering (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504730" title="CIF21">CIF21</a>), focuses specifically on ensuring that the science and engineering community has ready access to the advanced computational and data-driven capabilities required to tackle the most complex problems and issues facing today's scientific and educational communities.  To accomplish these goals requires advanced computational capabilities within  the context of a multilevel comprehensive and innovative infrastructure that benefits all fields of science and engineering.  Previous solicitations have concentrated on enabling petascale capability through the deployment and support of a world-class High Performance Computing (HPC) environment.  In the past decade NSF has provided the open science and engineering community with a number of state-of-the art HPC assets ranging from loosely coupled clusters to large-scale instruments with many thousands of computing cores communicating via fast interconnects, and more recently with diverse heterogeneous architectures.  Recent developments in computational science have begun to focus on complex, dynamic and diverse workflows, which integrate computation into all areas of the scientific process.  Some of these involve applications that are extremely data intensive and may not be dominated by floating point operation speed.  While a number of the earlier acquisitions have addressed a subset of these issues, the previous solicitation<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13528/nsf13528.htm"> NSF 13-528</a> and the current solicitation emphasize these aspects even further. </p>
            <p>Currently NSF operates, through Blue Waters and the eXtreme Digital (XD) program, a two-tiered comprehensive distributed Cyberinfrastructure (CI), which is one of the largest and most powerful in the world.  Through these and related projects the open science and engineering community is currently capable of tackling many of the most challenging scientific problems across multiple science and engineering domains.  Both of these tiers are explicitly designed to address needs beyond the campus level.  With this solicitation, NSF intends to continue this model to broaden the CI capabilities above the campus level, while promoting deeper campus engagement.  </p>
            <p>The resources supported under this solicitation will be incorporated into and allocated as part of the XD tier of national shared resources.  The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>) integrates resources from the XD tier and will provide shared services for this resource in the form of:  allocations, user support, training education and outreach services, an XSEDE-wide file system, which connects all the resources, and campus bridging.  Additional XD shared services provided include the following: the Technical Inspection Service (TIS), dedicated to the evaluation of software and providing recommendations to XSEDE on the use of that software  and the Technical Audit Service (TAS), dedicated to providing metrics for the systems supported within XD and also to the evaluation of applications on the XD systems.  The TAS operates <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://xdmod.ccr.buffalo.edu/" title="XDMoD">XDMoD,</a> a publically available and easily usable tool to extract a broad array of information concerning the way the XD resources are providing services to the open science community. </p>
            <p>The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by exploring new and creative approaches to delivering computational resources to the scientific community.  Consistent with the<em> Advanced Computing Infrastructure: Vision and Strategic Plan ( February 2012)</em>, the current solicitation is focused on expanding the use of high-end resources to a much larger and more diverse community.  To quote from that strategic plan, the goal is to &quot;... position and support the entire spectrum of NSF-funded communities ... and to promote a more comprehensive and balanced portfolio .... to support multidisciplinary computational and data-enabled science and engineering that in turn supports the entire scientific, engineering and educational community.&quot;  Thus, while continuing to provide essential and needed resources to the more traditional users of HPC, this solicitation expands the horizon to include research communities that are not users of traditional HPC systems, but who would benefit from advanced computational capabilities at the national level.  Building, testing, and deploying these resources within the collaborative ecosystem that encompasses national, regional and campus resources continues to remain a high priority for NSF and one of increasing importance to the science and engineering community.</p>
            <p>Resource Providers--those organizations willing to acquire, deploy and operate NSF supported resources in service to the science and engineering research and education community--play a key role in the provision and support of a national Cyberinfrastructure. With this solicitation, NSF requests proposals from organizations willing to serve as Resource Providers within the eXtreme Digital (XD) program.  In the past NSF has acquired and deployed these systems to the S&amp;E community using  the shared services model of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsed.org/">XSEDE</a> project as described above.  In that model, the resources are allocated via a competitive process, defined by NSF and managed by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.xsede.org/allocation-policies" title="xrac">XSEDE Resource Allocations Committee</a> (XRAC).  Depending on the type of resources and the objectives defined by the proposers, that process may require some accommodation or modification as is discussed below.</p>
            <p>Competitive proposals must address one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Complementing existing XD capabilities with new types of computational resources attuned to less traditional computational science communities;</li>
              <li>Incorporating innovative and reliable services within the HPC environment to deal with complex and dynamic workflows that contribute significantly to the advancement of science and are difficult to achieve within XD;</li>
              <li>Introducing new, flexible, and highly usable capabilities such as cloud computing into XD to meet national-scale requirements for new modes of computationally intensive scientific research;</li>
              <li>Introducing new capabilities and/or reaching new communities by establishing novel, highly usable connections to other non-XD parts of the national cyberinfrastructure.  For example, these might include connections to other domain-specific centers housing software, sensors or instrument data thus enabling new advances in computational science;</li>
              <li>Exploring new effective modes of engagement with campus cyberinfrastructure;</li>
              <li>Expanding  the range of computationally challenging science and engineering applications that can be tackled with current XD resources.  Again ease of access and usability are critical; and</li>
              <li>Providing reliable approaches to scientific communities needing a flexible and user friendly environment.  This can be achieved in a variety of ways and the proposal should explicitly provide details on how that would be achieved by their approach.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An important aspect of the current solicitation is that hardware acquisition must provide a high degree of stability and usability by no later than January, 2016.  Note, that proposals to add new and innovative features to currently deployed systems are eligible for consideration. </p>
            <p>In past solicitations benchmarks have played an important role.  Two types of benchmarks were required:  NSF-provided and proposer-selected benchmarks. For this solicitation, given the emphasis on nontraditional HPC as well as possible cloud-like solutions, and the potential breadth in targeted scientific impact, NSF has opted not to <em>require</em> a set of NSF-provided benchmarks.  Nonetheless, we still require that each proposer provide a convincing demonstration, with hard data, that their system will perform as described in their proposal.  Benchmarks certainly can address applications that are currently used by the NSF computational science community but must also provide compelling evidence of the expanded scientific diversity and new communities that will be reached from the innovative aspects of the proposed resource. Clearly the details of the submitted benchmark results will depend on the nature of the proposed resource and are likely to differ from one submission to the next.  </p>

         <a name="Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>
          <p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
          <p>Many research communities are operating at the confluence of theoretical, experimental and computational science and engineering.  Examples of scientists and engineers whose research require advanced computational and data resources include: climate scientists developing high resolution unified climate and weather models with fidelity at national and regional levels; biomolecular researchers developing reliable multiscale models for macromolecular folding, biochemical binding and reaction mechanisms, macromolecular pathways, and supramolecular cellular processes; physicists, engineers and behavioral scientists engaged in hazard analysis and management through coupling of ensemble simulations and behavioral models; astrophysicists investigating Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, building beyond the ability of observational astronomy; particle physicists investigating the fundamental building blocks of matter; aerospace engineers exploring wind turbine aerodynamics as well as coupled aeroacoustical, structural and aerodynamic simulations. </p>
          <p>Science and engineering research and education enabled by state-of-the-art HPC tools also have a direct bearing on the Nation's competitiveness and security. If investments in HPC are to have long-term impact on basic research problems of national need, then HPC resources must deliver high performance capability to a wide range of science and engineering applications and workflows.</p>
          <p>Academic researchers currently have access to a rich mix of HPC systems that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>deliver sustained performance in the tens of teraflops to &gt; 1 petaflop range on a variety of science and engineering codes capable of generating and analyzing petabyes of data;</li>
            <li>offer a variety of homogenous and heterogenous systems suitable for a broad range of computational science research; </li>
            <li>include storage appropriate for advanced multiscale, multiphysics 3D simulations;</li>
            <li>introduce resources appropriate to complex graph analytics,  high speed 3D image analysis, and workflows that require high speed queries for large datasets;</li>
            <li>are integrated into a national cyberinfrastructure environment; and are supported at national, regional and/or campus level; and</li>
            <li>include high throughput as well as high performance systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>NSF continues to support several systems delivering peak performance &gt; 1 petaflop across a range of increasingly broad science and engineering research applications matched with comparable data capabilities.  In addition, NSF also supports high throughtput compuational needs for thousands of researchers annually. However, resources to sustain data-driven analysis; to support smooth coupling/bursting with campus resources; to allow highly usable mixing of traditional multicore HPC and emerging computing modes; to explore effective, easy to use connections with other national and international research cyberinfrastructure and to increase usability for new computational communities have not grown at the comparable rate and NSF intends to pursue these shortfalls in the current solicitation. </p>
          <p>Reaching out to new communities by providing ease of access will be a critical part of a successful proposal. NSF strongly urges the community to think broadly and not simply rely on older models focused primarily on delivering compute cycles to traditional communities which use the national resources. Project durations will depend on the nature of the resource deployed and are discussed below. In what follows, the word acquisition will be taken to mean the hardware and/or the appropriate services required to deliver the specific capabilities proposed to the scientific community. <strong>An acquisition could be associated with the deployment of a new computational resource/capability or the upgrade of an existing system to encompass new capabilities.</strong> Each award will support the acquisition and deployment of the resource, software, and the personnel costs associated with the systems acquisition and deployment, including acceptance testing. Each proposal may be for a resource that occurs in one step near the beginning of the award period or for one that is deployed in phases during the award period. Proposals should clearly address the manner in which any innovative capability will be part of the final award by providing data, in the form of benchmarks. User support and operating costs will be no larger than 20% of the acquisition cost per annum for each deployed HPC system. These costs will be covered in a separate funding action and the size will depend on the nature of the resource deployed. Awards anticipate that 90% of the capacity/capability of the delivered system, will be available to the open science community through the national allocation process, XRAC. </p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>The purpose of this solicitation is to generate proposals from Resource Provider organizations who are committed to the delivery of world-leading High Performance Computing and Data enabled (HPC&amp;D) resources through the XD environment described in the <em>Program Synopsis</em>. This competition emphasizes the provision of systems and services that deliver significant levels of performance for many different types of science and engineering applications while also introducing new capabilities and significant innovation which will expand the value of HPC&amp;D to the science and engineering community. With this solicitation, NSF strongly urges the community to think broadly and not simply rely on older models focused primarily on delivering compute cycles to traditional communities which use the national resources.  </p>
          <p>The current solicitation explicitly focuses attention on modalities which either have never been explored or for systems that will make the XD portfolio more responsive to the needs of a larger and more diverse scientific community. </p>
          <p>Competitive HPC&amp;D proposals must address one or more of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complementing existing XD capabilities with new types of computational resources attuned to less traditional computational science communities;</li>
            <li>Incorporating innovative and reliable services within the HPC environment to deal with complex and dynamic workflows that contribute significantly to the advancement of science and are difficult to achieve within XD;</li>
            <li>Introducing new, flexible, and highly useable capabilities such as cloud computing into XD to meet national-scale requirements for new modes of computationally intensive scientific research;</li>
            <li>Introducing new capabilities and/or reaching new communities by establishing novel, highly usable connections to other non-XD parts of the national cyberinfrastructure. For example, these might include connections to other domain-specific centers housing software, sensors or instrument data thus enabling new advances in computational science;</li>
            <li>Exploring new effective modes of engagement with campus cyberinfrastructure;</li>
            <li>Expanding the range of computationally challenging science and engineering applications that can be tackled with current XD resources. Again ease of access and usability are critical; and</li>
            <li>Providing reliable approaches to scientific communities needing a flexible and user friendly environment. This can be achieved in a variety of ways and the proposal should explicitly provide details on how that would be achieved by their approach.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the purposes of this solicitation, an acquisition is defined as:  <em>computing hardware</em>, including processors and main memory, inter-connects, I/O sub-system(s); <em>local on-line storage</em> of sufficient size to support science and engineering research applications that use the full extent of the computing hardware; a wide-area <em>network connection</em>; <em>system software</em> including, one or more operating systems, one or more file systems, compilers and run-time libraries, mathematical libraries, debugging and program development tools, system administration and job scheduling software, user accounting software, any other software required to support the proposed resource; either dedicated nodes or small satellite systems that provide for interactive access, job preparation and staging, system management and/or remote visualization; any additional hardware or software associated with innovative aspects of the acquisition. </p>
          <p>For the FY 2014 proposal submission deadline, NSF is interested in receiving innovative proposals for production XD computational and data resources capable of complementing recent NSF HPC investments. The objective is to continue to diversify the NSF portfolio to include capabilities suitable for addressing emerging computationally intense scientific and engineering research topics, workflows and communities that are not optimally served by current XD or Blue Waters resources. </p>
          <p>In past solicitations benchmarks have played an important role.  Two types of benchmarks were required:  NSF-provided and proposer-selected benchmarks. For this solicitation, given the emphasis on nontraditional HPC as well as possible cloud-like solutions, and the potential breadth in targeted scientific impact, NSF has opted not to <em>require</em> a set of NSF-provided benchmarks.  One reason for this decision is that the current solicitation is not focused on funding a single, large resource designed to serve tightly coupled scientific applications dominated by floating point operations, needing many thousands of cores, that typically place the most stringent computational demands on the system to be provisioned.  Nonetheless, each proposer must provide a convincing demonstration, with hard data, that their system will perform as described in their proposal.  Benchmarks certainly can address applications that are currently used by the NSF computational science community but should also provide compelling evidence of the expanded scientific diversity and new communities reached from the innovative aspects of the proposed resource. Clearly the details of the submitted benchmark results will depend on the nature of the proposed resource and is likely to differ from one submission to the next. Detailed information on the proposal format is provided in <em>Section V., Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions</em>.</p>
          <p>The system and services deployed as a result of this solicitation, will become part of the portfolio of resources supported by NSF for shared use by the national science and engineering research and education community within XD.  NSF expects that 90% of the funded resources will be allocated for open scientific use.  Accordingly, the proposal should leverage and complement the shared capabilities currently provided by the existing national infrastructure, resources and services such as  <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://xdmod.ccr.buffalo.edu/" title="XDMoD">XDMoD</a>.  Unless otherwise specified, it is expected that at least 90% of the available system resources will be allocated via the XRAC process.</p>

        <p>Describe the availability of experts to address any system integration problems that arise as the resource is deployed. This expertise may be provided by the proposing  Service Provider and/or by other vendor, academic or government partners. Proposers should make clear their previous associations, if any, with these partners. The breadth of knowledge, depth of interaction, and technical abilities of partners will be considered in the review process. This knowledge and expertise is particularly important in supporting advanced programming or usage paradigms (e.g. compilers for parallel environments, problem solving environments, distributed computing), tools (e.g. performance visualization, parallel debuggers) and system elements (e.g. parallel file systems, virtualization).</p>
        <p>Describe user access to the resource during the deployment phase and prior to system acceptance, including during testing.</p>

        <p>High-performance applications are expected to produce many terabytes of data. Describe how these data will be handled, how data integrity will be maintained, what backup and contingency procedures and schedules, if any, how they will be provided and how they will be implemented.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>Both physical and operational security of cyberinfrastructure resources are important considerations.   Describe project roles and responsibilities with respect to cybersecurity for the facility.  How will risk be assessed, what technical safeguards will be in place, what administrative safeguards will be maintained; what physical safeguards are planned; how will policies and procedures for cybersecurity be established and maintained; what are the plans for awareness and training; and what would be the procedures for notification to NSF, the user community, and other CI communities, authorities (Police, FBI, etc).

        <p>Include a more detailed explanation of the budget for user support and operating costs <strong><em>in the Supplementary Documents section of the proposal (this should not exceed 5 pages)</em></strong>. <em><strong>Information provided will be used to help NSF assess the operating cost-performance attributes of the proposed system.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Describe any other factors that are anticipated to have an impact on the Total Cost of Ownership of the proposed system.</p>
        <p><strong>Broadening Participation</strong></p>
        <p>The Project Description must contain, as a <strong>separate section within the narrative</strong>, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes.

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>Proposals for this solicitation will also be subject to the additional review criteria described below. These criteria parallel specific sections in the Project Description.
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meeting the Needs of the Challenging      Science and Engineering Applications. </strong>How well does      the resource proposed match the known and      anticipated requirements of the science and engineering research and      education community for HPC resources and services?  How well does      the resource proposed respond to the broadening of the current portfolio      of XD spelled out in the Program Description? Will the      innovative capability stimulate new research and      education?   Will the innovative aspects attract both existing      and new science and engineering communities?  Does the proposer data      convincingly demonstrate the value of the innovative      capability?  Will the proposed system and services complement the      existing XD resources?  Can the proposed resource provide the      necessary capability required to generate new, breakthrough, science and      engineering discoveries? Where benchmark results have been estimated, are      these estimates credible?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>System Reliability and Usability</strong>.      Are the system and the operation of the system likely to provide a robust,      reliable, high-productivity computational environment for new and existing      XD users? What is the commitment of the vendor or vendors to meet the      agreed performance goals and to provide post-acquisition support? Does the      environment in which the system will be embedded include adequate      capability for the remote analysis of output from high-end      computations?  Does the system, operations and support plan      expand <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>/XD capabilities for      researchers and educators?  Will existing <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>/XD users be able to easily migrate      to/from this system?  Will the resource attract      new research communities?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Implementation, Project Management and      Risk Mitigation</strong>. Is there an adequate procedure for      ensuring that the proposed resource will be available for use by the      science and engineering research and education community? Does the      proposing organization have the capability to manage the award and any      associated sub-contracts? Does the PI have the capability to manage the      project? Is the PI's time commitment sufficient to ensure success of the      project?  Is the detailed implementation plan for acquisition and      deployment adequate and realistic? Is the implementation of the innovative      capability sufficiently detailed?  Are the metrics appropriate to the      outcome defined for the innovative component?  Are the plans for      integration into the XD and the associated costs reasonable? Does the      proposing organization and its partners have the expertise to meet any      challenges likely to be encountered while deploying the complete system      (including data storage, communications and core software environment) and      bringing it to production status? Has there been a reasonable assessment      of potential risks and does the proposal include an adequate risk      management strategy?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quality and Availability of the Physical      Infrastructure</strong>. Are the physical facilities described by      the proposing organization adequate to accommodate the system proposed?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Effective User Support.</strong> What are the qualifications and experience of the PI and the proposing      organization in regard to managing a production resource for national use      and providing effective user support?  Are they tightly integrated to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>/XD user services?  Has user      support for the innovative capability been adequately considered?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total Cost of Ownership.</strong> Are the budget and roster of personnel for operations and user support      adequate and reasonable? Do they highly leverage the common services of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>/XD? Assess the total cost of      ownership of the proposed system. Is this reasonable in light of the      advances in science and engineering likely to result?   </li>
        </ul>
 

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Site Visit Review.</p>
        <p>Ad hoc plus panel review</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
        <p>Awards made as a result of this competition will include performance requirements and metrics for the proposed systems. If appropriate, an awardee will include terms and conditions in any subcontract agreement to address schedule and performance expectations and the impact of delays in delivery.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
       <p> Additional reporting requirements apply, will be negotiated with the Service Provider prior to award, and will be incorporated into the special terms and conditions of the award.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
