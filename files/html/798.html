National Science Technology Council
Regional Forum on Research Business Models 

Hosted by the University of North Carolina
Chapel Hill, North Carolina
November 17, 2003

The NSTC Committee on Science has chartered a Subcommittee on Research Business Models (RBM), 
which is undertaking a review of policies, procedures and plans relating to the business 
relationship between Federal agencies and research performers (additional information about 
the Subcommittee is available online at http://rbm.nih.gov/). 

Given that much has changed about the practice of scientific research over the past several years, 
the RBM is holding a series of regional workshops this Fall/Winter to solicit input and feedback 
from the research performer community (information regarding the other RBM-sponsored workshops is 
available on the website referenced above).  The public is invited to join representatives from the 
Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Research Business Models Subcommittee on November 
17th, 2003 in Chapel Hill, NC to provide input on how to facilitate a strong, coordinated effort 
across Federal agencies to identify and address important policy implications arising from the 
changing nature of basic and applied research.  

The theme of this regional forum will be Appropriate Costs of Research Enterprise-Determination, 
Recovery, and Accountability and the topics to be addressed include:

* Accountability;
* Cost Compliance; 
* Electronic Research Administration;* 
* Assistance and Procurement; and 
* Intramural versus Extramural
 
A diverse group of panelists from the research performer community will lead discussions 
throughout the day.  The morning session will focus on costs, accountability, and electronic 
research administration, including such issues as costs of compliance, accountability 
requirements, including A-133 and agency audit practice and electronic access and agency 
systems.  The afternoon session will focus on principles of partnership, specifically 
reaffirming the principles of 
partnership and aligning the principles with standards and agency, research awardee and 
audit practices.  Two hours have been reserved in the afternoon for a public comment period.  

Registration is required.  There is a $50.00 charge for this event.  For further information
