<b>Synopsis of Program:</b> </p>
<div class="user_input"><blockquote>

		<p class="MsoBodyText3">The Instrumentation for Materials Research - Major Instrumentation Project (IMR-MIP) program in the Division of Materials Research provides support for the design and construction&#160;of major instruments&#160;costing more than $2 million at major US facilities. The program also supports the development of detailed conceptual and engineering design for new tools for materials preparation or characterization at major national facilities.&#160; Such instruments may include, for&#160;example,&#160; neutron beam lines, synchrotron beam lines, and high field magnets, as well as development of detectors and preparation environments necessary to support materials research.&#160; The program supports two types of awards: Conceptual and Engineering Design (CED) awards and Construction (CNST) awards.&#160; A CED award will enable the proposer to do the necessary engineering design of the instrument.&#160; A CNST proposal may only be submitted after a satisfactory engineering design of the instrument has been completed and has been approved by both the facility at which the instrument will be situated and by NSF.&#160; The program&#160;does not provide operating funds for projects it supports through this solicitation.&#160; Operational costs must be supported either by the facility at which the instrument is&#160;located or through some other source. In FY&#160;2004 the program budget was&#160;$3.0 million. This level of support is expected to increase in FY 2005 and future years,&#160;depending upon the availability of funds.&#160;</p>

<H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3><div class="user_input"><p class="MsoBodyText">National facilities<sup>(1)</sup> provide sophisticated tools and facilities for materials preparation and characterization essential for researchers studying materials in a wide range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, the geosciences, and engineering.&#160; They include, for example, facilities for neutron scattering, synchrotron radiation, and high magnetic fields.&#160; Through the program described in this Solicitation, NSF intends to support the design and construction of a variety of mid-scale instruments<sup>(2)</sup>, including <i>but not limited to</i> beamlines,&#160;high-field magnets, detectors, and preparation environments at major US facilities.&#160; Some of these&#160;instruments may be developed in partnership with other federal agencies.&#160; NSF has a key role to play in supporting the education and training of the future researchers who will develop instrumentation for these facilities and use them effectively for the advancement of science.&#160; Therefore priority will be given to those proposals which involve students in the design and construction of the instruments.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">______________</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><sup>(1)</sup> National facilities are research facilities with specialized instrumentation available to the scientific research community in general and the materials research community in particular.&#160;&#160;These facilities provide unique research capabilities that can be located at only a few highly specialized laboratories in the nation. They include facilities and resources for research using high magnetic fields, ultraviolet and x-ray synchrotron radiation, neutron scattering, and nanofabrication.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><sup>(2)</sup>For the purposes of this Solicitation, &#8220;mid-scale instruments" - also called "major instrumentation projects&#8221; - are those with construction costs greater than about $2 million but less than about $20 million.&#160; Support for smaller projects is available through NSF&#8217;s Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program.</p>

<hr />
<br clear="all" />
<p class="MsoNormal">This Program will:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Help address the urgent need to increase the number and quality of mid-scale&#160;instruments available to the entire US research community in materials and related areas of science and engineering.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Enable the training of the next generation of instrument scientists and engineers.&#160;</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Enable existing instruments to be upgraded as new technology becomes available.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Optimize the choice of instruments built by picking the most mature projects for construction.&#160;</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3><div class="user_input"><p class="MsoNormal">The&#160;Instrumentation for Materials Research - Major Instrumentation Projects (IMR-MIP)&#160;Program supports the design and construction only; operation of the&#160;instruments built with these funds is to be provided from other sources (<i>i.e.,</i> other programs within NSF or non-NSF funds).&#160;&#160;Staffing and operating the&#160;instrument&#160;will remain the responsibility of the proposing institution.&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The&#160;IMR-MIP program will consider two different types of proposals:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Conceptual and Engineering Design (CED) proposals may request support to develop concepts for mid-scale projects to a level of maturity sufficient to determine whether such a project is ready for construction.&#160; Projects for which detailed engineering designs are needed are those with subsequent construction costs greater than about $5 million.&#160; A successful CED proposal does not guarantee that the subsequent construction of the instrument will be funded.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Construction (CNST) proposals may request support for the construction of the instruments.&#160; In order to be considered for possible funding, CNST proposals <i>must</i> include a detailed engineering design, with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to level 4 &#91;see section V.A.c. below for definitions&#93;, together with a detailed cost estimate.&#160; This level of detail can be provided by a previous CED award or by a similar study funded through other sources (<i>e.g.,</i> institutional support, private funding).&#160; The WBS must meet the approval of both the facility at which the instrument will be located and&#160;NSF's National Facilities (NAF) Program Director.&#160; The&#160;IMR-MIP Program expects to make one 5-year award from each annual competition.&#160; The CNST awards will be funded as Cooperative Agreements.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">The&#160;IMR-MIP Program accepts proposals from university researchers for the design and construction of mid-scale tools for materials research &#8211; including equipment for materials characterization or preparation, such as detectors, beam lines, new high-field magnets,&#160;or preparation environments&#160;&#8211; at&#160;user facilities&#160;supported by NSF or other sources, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&#160; For example, these could include proposals for beam-line instrumentation at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The scientific team that constructs such&#160;an instrument&#160;will be limited to 25% of the total time available on that instrument, while at least 75% will be available for the facility to allocate to other users through its normal peer review process.&#160; To make sure that the facility is willing to entertain such a project, the Principal Investigators (PIs) for a CED or CNST proposal must attach to the proposal a letter from the facility director stipulating that if the PIs are successful in obtaining subsequent construction funding, the facility will allow construction and will staff and operate the equipment at the completion of construction through the operations phase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is not necessary that a PI have received a CED award prior to submitting a CNST proposal, so long as the documents necessary for a detailed review have been provided which meet both the facility and NSF approval.&#160; Not all CED awards are expected to result in successful CNST proposals.</p>

<a name="full_prop_inst"></a>
<p><b>Full Proposal Instructions:</b> </p>

<a name="prop_prep_gpg_txt"></a>
<a name="prop_nstd_gdln_txt"></a> <p><p>Proposals submitted in response to this program announcement/solicitation should be prepared and submitted in accordance with the general guidelines contained in the NSF <i>Grant Proposal Guide</i> (GPG). The complete text of the GPG is available electronically on the NSF Website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpg</a>. Paper copies of the GPG may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<div class="user_input"><p class="MsoNormal">The following special instructions deviate from the GPG guidelines.&#160; Proposals must contain the items listed below and adhere to the specified page limitations.&#160; <em>No additional information may be provided by links to web pages.</em>&#160; Proposals not meeting the GPG guidelines and the following instructions will be returned without review.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><b>Cover Sheet:</b> Select the program solicitation number from the pull down list. A single NSF Unit of Consideration will then automatically be entered.&#160; FastLane allows one Principal Investigator (PI) and at most four Co-PIs to be designated.&#160; Additional lead personnel should be designated as non co-PI Senior Personnel.&#160; <strong>The title should start with "IMR-MIP:".</strong></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><b>Project Summary</b> (2-page limit): Provide a summary description of the proposed project including discussion of its objectives and key features in a manner that will be informative to a general technical audience.&#160; The project summary must separately address both NSF review criteria of intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposed activity.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><b>Project Description:</b> The project description section contains the following items <i>a</i> through <em>e</em>, and is limited to a combined total length of 20 pages for CED proposals and 50 pages for CNST proposals, inclusive of tables, figures, or other graphical data.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><strong>a. Introduction:</strong> Describe briefly where the project "fits" on a national and international level.&#160; Limit: 1 page.&#160; This one-page item is included within the page limitation for the Project Description.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><b>b. Vision and Goals:</b> Describe the vision and goals for the proposed project, including its potential in enabling the nation&#8217;s research and education infrastructure for materials science and engineering and its broader educational and societal impacts.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><b>c. Capabilities of the Project:</b> Conceptual and Engineering Design (CED) proposals may request support to develop concepts for mid-scale projects to a level of maturity sufficient to determine whether such a project is ready for construction.&#160; Projects for which detailed engineering designs are needed are those with subsequent construction costs greater than $5 million.&#160; The proposal should provide a brief but compelling scientific justification for the project; summarize the qualifications of the Principal Investigator and his or her collaborators, indicating their ability to complete a design with the necessary detail; and summarize the approach to be taken in completing the design.&#160; CED proposals for mid-scale&#160;instruments are expected to require funding up to about $2 million in total. To make sure that the facility where the instrument would be located&#160;is willing to entertain such a project, the Principal Investigators for a CED proposal must attach a letter from the facility director stating that if they are successful in obtaining subsequent construction funding, the facility will staff and operate the project at the completion of construction through the operation phase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Construction (CNST) proposals may request support for the construction of mid-scale projects.&#160; The proposal should begin with a compelling scientific case, justifying the need for the project; summarize the qualifications of the Principal Investigators for overseeing such a construction project; include a detailed engineering design, with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to level 4 (<i>cf.</i> , reference 3); provide detailed staffing estimates; indicate the scheduling of major aspects of the work; and provide a detailed estimate of the costs of the project.&#160;NSF does not allow a separate budgeting for contingencies. However, the budget justification should contain discussion of, where appropriate, contingencies. Estimates for necessary materials, staffing, and other major cost drivers must be presented carefully enough so that the total cost of the project is sufficient to accommodate unanticipated problems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This level of detail can be provided by a previous CED award or by a similar study funded through other sources (<i>e.g.,</i> institutional support, private funding).&#160; The CNST awards will be funded as Cooperative Agreements. To make sure that the facility is willing to entertain such a project, the Principal Investigators for a CNST proposal must attach a letter from the facility director stating that if they are successful in obtaining construction funding, the facility will staff and operate the equipment &#8211; detector, instrument, beam line, <i>etc.</i> &#8211; at the completion of construction through the operations phase.&#160;</p>

<h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3><a name="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4><a name="reviewproc"></a>
<P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P><P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB 97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </P><P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding decisions.</P><P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P><P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P><P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P><UL><B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</UL><UL><B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</UL><P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</P><UL><I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</UL><UL><I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</UL><UL><A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></A> <B>Additional Review Criteria</B>:<p class="MsoNormal">There are four &#8220;Critical Decisions&#8221; (CDs) for projects seeking funding through the&#160;IMR-MIP program: CD-1, the need for the project; CD-2, approval of the project baseline; CD-3, authorization to begin construction; and CD-4, readiness to begin operations.&#160; For a CED proposal, the decision to recommend an award is equivalent to CD-1, acceptance of the justification for the proposed project.&#160; This decision will be based upon <em>ad hoc&#160;</em> mail review of CED proposals and, if deemed necessary, culminating in a "reverse site visit." <strong>A reverse site visit consists&#160;of a review where the principal investigator and his associates come to NSF to make a presentation to a review panel.</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With the support of a CED award, the Principal Investigator (PI) embarks upon the development of a detailed engineering design and a project baseline, including a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) complete to Level 4 (as defined in standard project-management references, <em>e.g</em>., reference 2).&#160; These documents form the basis for a CNST proposal.&#160; It is not necessary that a PI have received a CED award prior to submitting a CNST proposal, so long as the documents necessary for a detailed review have been provided which meet both the facility and NSF approval.&#160;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The review of CNST proposals will involve&#160;<em>ad hoc</em> mail review which may be followed by a "reverse site visit" for meritorious proposals.&#160; For each of the major elements of the WBS,&#160;reviews will include a detailed evaluation of the costs, schedule, personnel estimates, technical risks, and project management.&#160; The WBS&#160;must be sufficiently detailed to provide confidence that the project can be completed on time and within the estimated budget.&#160; The purpose of this review is to assure NSF that the project is feasible and well managed, that there is a mechanism for addressing any technical risks involved, and that the costs are well controlled.&#160; A recommendation to fund a CNST award essentially constitutes CD-2 and CD-3 for the project.&#160; Not all CED awards are expected to result in successful CNST proposals.</p>

<p>Reviewers will thus be asked to address the following additional criteria:</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">For CED proposals,</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText3">Is the scientific justification for the proposed project sufficiently strong to justify the preparation of a detailed engineering design?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Do the Principal Investigator and his or her collaborators have the capabilities to complete a design with the necessary detail?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Is the approach to be taken in completing the design appropriate, and is it likely to produce an engineering design containing sufficient detail to form the basis for a decision on construction?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Is an adequate management structure described to oversee the construction of a mid-scale instrument should the CED proposal be funded?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Has the facility director indicated that, if construction funding is approved, the facility will staff and operate the project at the completion of construction through the operation phase?</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">For CNST proposals,</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText3">Is the scientific justification for the proposed project sufficiently strong to justify construction?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Do the Principal Investigator and his or her collaborators have the capabilities to oversee construction?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Is the engineering design sufficiently detailed, with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to level 4?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Are the staffing, scheduling, and cost estimates sufficiently detailed to provide confidence that the project can be completed on schedule and within the estimated budget?&#160; In particular, have these estimates been made with sufficient care so that the total cost of the project is expected to be sufficient to accommodate unanticipated problems?</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoNormal">Is a management structure in place to oversee the instrument construction from start to finish?&#160; Have contingency plans been established to overcome unexpected technical risks?&#160; Is the time to completion reasonable?&#160; Has adequate attention been given to possible delays from suppliers?</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">NSF will endeavor to inform&#160;proposers promptly whether or not they have been selected to participate in a &#8220;reverse site visit.&#8221;&#160; This notification is intended to allow at least one month to prepare for the review.&#160; Proposers submitting proposals should receive notice of the outcome of the review within six months following proposal submission.&#160; For those proposals&#160;selected for&#160;a &#8220;reverse site visit&#8221; a summary narrative of the evaluation and recommendations resulting from the initial <em>ad hoc</em> mail review&#160;will be provided to the PI and to the panel conducting the reverse site review.</p>

After programmatic approval has been obtained, proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of&#160;grants (for CED awards) or Cooperative Agreements (for CNST awards).
 </UL><BR><a name="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4> <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal.  Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Ad Hoc and/or panel review. </p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p> In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee of an eventual award. </p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation, or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3><a name="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>
  Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants 
  Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are 
  declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division 
  administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the 
  reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section 
  VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)
</p> <a name="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpm</a>.

<a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a>
<a name="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must 
  submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before 
  the end of the current budget period.  
</p><a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>

	<div class="user_input">
	<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the mandatory annual project reports, post-award oversight will consist of annual project reviews.&#160; For the CED awards, &#160; the PIs for each active&#160;award&#160; will be required to present a detailed progress reports to NSF.&#160; For the CNST awards, the annual project reviews will involve a site visit to the project location with an external review committee which will evaluate costs, schedule, project management and assess technical risks for each of the major elements of the work breakdown schedule.&#160; The purpose of the CNST review is to provide NSF with continuing assurance that the project is&#160;well managed, that technical risks are being addressed effectively,&#160;that costs are well controlled, and the project is on schedule.&#160; NSF may terminate CNST projects that experience unacceptable cost overruns or delays.</p>
</div>
 <p>
  Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final 
  project report.  Failure to provide final 
  technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs.  PIs 
  should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
  required data. 
</p>

<p>
PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. 
  This system permits electronic submission and updating of project reports, including 
  information on project participants (individual and organizational), activities and 
  findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions.   PIs will not be 
  required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in 
  earlier updates using the electronic system.

The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</P><P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control number.
