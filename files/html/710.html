<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Theoretical Foundations (TF) program supports basic research into the central issues underlying computer and information science and technology. The program is broadly concerned with problems and questions that range from purely theoretical studies, on the one hand, to applications within various fields of science and technology, on the other. TF research and education projects strengthen the intellectual foundations of algorithms and theoretical computer science, cryptography, network and communication theory, information theory, numeric and scientific computing, signal processing, and geometric algorithms, and bring advanced mathematical capabilities from these areas to bear on fundamental problems throughout science and engineering.</p>
<p>
				</div>
				<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a></p>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The TF program comprises five program elements: Communications Research; Numeric, Symbolic and Geometric Computing; Signal Processing Systems; Scientific Foundations for Internet&rsquo;s Next Generation (SING); and, the Theory of Computing. The program supports research within the purview of these elements as well as research that spans multiple areas.</p>
<p>The program emphasizes the integration of research and education in all areas of interest. Principal investigators (PIs) range from researchers beginning their careers to senior investigators. Research that has the potential to strengthen the foundations of computer science is strongly encouraged.&nbsp; Collaborations between theoretical computer science and other areas of computer science as well as with engineering, mathematics, statistics, and other sciences are also welcome. While each program element described below describes a set of specific topics, in some cases research opportunities extend beyond artificially imposed programmatic boundaries. Consequently, proposals that address cross-cutting research opportunities are also encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Communications Research</strong></p>
<p>This program element seeks advances in theory and techniques for the secure and efficient representation, transmission and reception of digital and analog information over a variety of channels (e.g., wired line, mobile multi-antenna wireless, optical, and biological channels). &nbsp;Research and education contributions to a) theory, b) algorithms, and c) applications based on new theoretical foundations are sought.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
				<li>
								<p> Contributions in theory include those in: communication theory, information theory, and theoretical studies of mobility and traffic. An area of interest is modeling and analysis of the capacity and performance of communication systems, where non-traditional noise models for a variety of channels continue to play a crucial role. Network information theory, network coding, multi-user coding, source and channel coding are also of interest. &nbsp;Research in multi-user communications is encouraged.&nbsp; In particular, investigations into modulation and coding techniques that exploit the time, frequency and spatial dimensions of channels and MIMO channels are of interest.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
								<p>Research promoting advances in algorithms, for example, those that work across network layers such as multicast, broadcast, and geocast algorithms, is encouraged.&nbsp;</p>
				</li>
				<li>
								<p>Applications based on new theoretical foundations, or new theory prompted by new applications are sought. Applications include those involving multi-sensory input, cooperative communications, and, in general, applications of communication and information theory in sensor systems.</p>
				</li>
</ol>
<p>Fundamental research efforts should aim at re-defining the reference framework for communications, in addition to cross layer research.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Numeric, Symbolic and Geometric Computing</strong></p>
<p>The numeric, symbolic and geometric (NSG) computing program element investigates the application of computing to mathematical objects, such as differential equations, algebraic structures, and geometric constructs.&nbsp; The goal of NSG projects is increased understanding of computing through investigations in this domain.&nbsp; The NSG program element is sub-divided into three areas: a) numerical computing and optimization; b) symbolic and algebraic computation; and c) computational geometry.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, new ventures that combine numerical, algebraic, symbolic, and computational paradigms are especially welcome.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
				<li> Numerical computing and optimizations lie at the heart of scientific computing and computational sciences, and are essential to leverage the full potential of advanced architectures. Investigations into new data structures and algorithms that yield optimizations for particular applications are encouraged.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
				<p>To support computational science in applications throughout science and engineering, research that integrates numerical computing and optimization into problem-solving environments is required. This includes the design and construction of high quality scientific software ideally adept across numerous scientific domains.</p>
				<p>Specific research topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: numerical linear and multi-linear algebras, tensor algebras and decompositions used in memory hierarchy mappings; linear and non-linear optimization; modeling and simulation of complex processes; and numerical solutions of differential equations and PDE&rsquo;s. Research in numerical computing and optimization has natural interdisciplinary applications. In fact, this program seeks applications in science and engineering whose basic problems actually require the development of new numerical and optimization methods.</p>
				</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
				<li>
								<p><strong> </strong>The genesis of the field of symbolic and algebraic computation was in the early symbolic manipulation programs. &nbsp;Now, the intellectual work necessary to advance the field requires deep exploration at the intersection of computer science and mathematics. Research focused on finding powerful methods for symbolically solving algebraic - numeric systems that combine differential, integral and polynomial equations is required.&nbsp; Interests include foundational research in algorithms and their efficient execution. Basic research topics include: computational algebra and analysis, computational number theory and algebraic geometry, integration of numeric and symbolic techniques, symbolic scientific applications and software. Fruitful application areas for symbolic computation include: cryptography, optimization, and the solution of complex equation sets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
								<p>The field of computational geometry (CG) grew out of the need to solve problems in motion planning, the design of 3D objects, and the assessment of information in large databases. The design and analysis of new geometrical algorithms, as well as the creation of software and tools for doing geometric computations, are of interest.</p>
				</li>
</ol>
<p>The identification of CG techniques that will assist in exploring, segregating, analyzing, assessing and viewing data is of particular interest. This includes using deep mathematical ideas to develop new ideas and directions. Another research area of interest stems from the practical need for CG techniques that manage large-scale, distributed, networked, spatial-temporal geometric data acquired at a high rate. Additional applications that may motivate advances in computational geometry fundamentals include, for example, graphics, visualization, information systems, robotics, engineering design, molecular biology, astrophysics, and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Signal Processing Systems</strong></p>
<p>This TF program element supports basic research in signal processing algorithms and supporting software and hardware systems that ensure signal processing remains an enabling technology for information systems and serves as a catalyst for new technological and theoretical innovations. Specific research topics of interest include, <em>but are not limited to</em>, the following: sampling/representation, compression and enhancement of both one dimensional and multidimensional spatio-temporal data; statistical signal and array processing; multimedia and multimodal signal processing precipitated by the needs of surveillance as well as the entertainment industry; signal processing for wireless communications; collaborative/distributed signal processing for sensor networks and other distributed systems; novel biometric signal/image processing methodologies for national security; signal processing for biomedical applications; signal processing methods inspired by fundamental biological processes including sequencing as well as cellular communication. Also of interest is research in new paradigms that enlarge the scope of signal processing from the domain of the linear to the realm of the nonlinear &ndash; from linear algebra to algebra, from Euclidean to curved spaces, from uniformly to highly non-uniformly time and space sampled processes, to signal processing on graphs.&nbsp; Research that will develop efficient power aware and hardware-friendly algorithms and research on signal processing algorithms for the new network science of distributed, decentralized, and cooperative algorithms that avoid global communications is encouraged.&nbsp; The exploration of new approaches to manage massive datasets, such as compressive sampling, also promise advances in the field.</p>
<p>The TF program is particularly interested in the application of signal processing in complex systems. &nbsp;Examples include exciting new applications, from the &ldquo;Glass-Wired World&ldquo; to monitoring the Nation&rsquo;s Critical Infrastructures (see <a href="http://www.ece.wisc.edu/~nowak/ci">http://www.ece.wisc.edu/~nowak/ci</a>). &nbsp;These new application domains may pose new constraints and challenges, leading to the reexamination of old questions and assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Foundations for Internet&rsquo;s Next Generation (SING)</strong></p>
<p>The theory of networked computing is a new formulation of state-of-the-art problems faced by computer networks. Control, especially feedback problems, is expected to play an increasing role in the Internet. Models hinging on temporal and spatial distribution of information and power are sought. &nbsp;Network theory is likely to provide new insights into the theoretical foundations of social networks, game theory, and auction theory. Further, mobile information sources are likely to inspire new insights in the theory of computing.</p>
<p>Motivated by a desire to establish the theoretical foundations essential for the clean-slate redesign of the Internet, SING draws upon expertise and knowledge in the theoretical foundations of computing and communications, as well as signal processing. The goal of Internet redesign is to increase security, mobility, location cognition, power efficiency, and other desirable network properties. SING research studies go beyond incremental redesign that improves one or two of these specific properties.</p>
<p>Fundamental theoretical and algorithmic studies involving coordination and cooperation are encouraged. Research in streaming algorithms for massive datasets is of particular interest. Scalability, complexity, and interactivity problems need to be addressed. Tradeoffs between communication and computation and storage are of vital interest. The role of mobility in information dissemination needs to be analyzed and exploited. Algorithmic distributed mechanism design and distributed control are crucial with sensing and control applications.</p>
<p>Applications based on new theoretical foundations require investigations ranging from the role of location from spatial behavior of propagation to &ldquo;place.&rdquo; &nbsp;In general, applications of sensing and control over the network, along with the theoretical underpinnings, are of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Theory of Computing</strong></p>
<p><em>Theoretical computer science</em> is about understanding the nature of computation - its inherent power and its limitations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Computation&rdquo; is meant in a broad sense to include mathematical models of computation, human-designed computing on real computers and what might be called natural computing, that is, computing occurring in nature or inspired by natural processes. A central set of issues involves the development of tools, techniques, and paradigms for efficient computation.</p>
<p>Specific areas in the theory of computing element of TF include but are not limited to: design and analysis of algorithms (probabilistic, approximation, sublinear, parallel/distributed, on-line, etc.); data-structures; computational complexity; randomness and derandomization; cryptography; discrete and computational geometry; games, economics, and auctions; combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, algorithmic graph theory; hardness of approximation; mathematical learning theory; logic and formal methods; quantum computation; networks and the theory of network computation; computational biology; and coding and information.</p>
<p>Work in the theory of computing that is directed towards applications in other areas of computer science, or in other areas of science, is welcome.&nbsp; This is the case especially when the application necessitates the development of new theory.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Program Activities and Beyond</strong></p>
<p>The TF program strongly encourages proposals that transcend the confines of each of the areas delineated above and other CISE programs. For example, computational geometry and theory of computing proposals that address challenges in managing large-scale, distributed, networked, spatial-temporal geometric data may impact a number of programs within CISE and some outside the CISE Directorate. Similarly, signal processing proposals that explore novel clustering and classification algorithms in learning theory may be relevant to various signal/image understanding challenges that are addressed in various programs in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems and the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
				<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
								How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
				<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
								How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?				</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
				<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
								One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
								</div>
				</p>
				<p>				<em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
								Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<p><a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a></p>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<p><a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a></p>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a></p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
