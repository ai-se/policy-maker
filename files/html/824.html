<P><B>Q. I am a little unsure about the difference between the Leadership 
and the Institutional Transformation Awards. Could you give me some 
clarification?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> The Institutional Transformation awards require cost sharing, 
evaluation mechanisms, and negotiation with NSF. The expectation is that 
institutions receiving these awards will initiate and sustain organizational 
change. These are likely to be large, complex efforts. The Leadership awards are 
probably most appropriate for smaller-scale efforts, or for use by an individual 
or organization that has developed some "home grown" programs that need funding 
to scale-up and institutionalize. Leadership awards are also designed to provide 
support for individuals to maintain an active research program and/or laboratory 
while the individual is working on activities that target increased 
participation and advancement of women faculty members. 

<P><B>Q.  Do you know where I could locate some information on 
programs/institutions that have previously received the NSF/ADVANCE Leadership 
Award grant?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> This is the first year of the ADVANCE program, so there are no prior 
grantees.</P>

<P><B>Q. I am a new faculty member in a tenure track position. As 
a graduate student and postdoc, I was part of an active group of women examining 
issues of advancement in academia for women and working with the university 
administration to effect change. I would like to develop a similar group within 
my current institution, connecting the ideas and practices to which I have been 
exposed in the past with present experience. I believe this can have a positive 
impact on the environment for women in this institution. I recognize that this 
will take time from either my teaching or my research. Would partial salary 
support for such an activity be a supportable activity?</b></P><P>
<B>A. </b>Yes, you may request partial salary support to allow you to 
pursue programs to encourage the adoption of best practices for advancing women 
in science or engineering.</P>
</DIR>

<P><A name="eligibility"></a><FONT color=#008080 SIZE=3><B>Eligibility</B></FONT></P>

<DIR>
<P><B>Q.  I read the rules and descriptions of the new program ADVANCE. It 
seems to me that I don't fit in any of the categories there. I am a new faculty 
in a tenure track position, so I do not fit the Fellows category. How about the 
leadership category? Can I submit a proposal to continue funding my current 
research and keep working as a tenure track faculty?</b></P><P>
<B>A. </b>Leadership Awards are intended to recognize the contributions 
made to date by organizations and/or individuals who have enabled the increased 
participation and advancement of women in academic and engineering careers, as 
well as to enable awardees to sustain, intensify and initiate new activities 
designed to make further progress. Leadership Awards are not intended to be a 
substitute for seeking core research funding from NSF's research programs to 
fund an individual's current research. The NSF has long-established methods to 
allow applicants to seek funds via competitive proposal submission; one of these 
would be the appropriate avenue for obtaining research support. </P>

<P><B>Q. I am conducting research on enhancing the retention of 
women in academic careers. I would like to take the results of my research and 
work with my college to put in place policies and practices that have been shown 
to influence retention positively. Would I be eligible to apply for a leadership 
award? Would support for part of my salary be appropriate, given that this 
implementation would contribute to my research work while at the same time 
providing leadership for my institution on approaches to retaining women 
scientists and engineers as faculty?</b></P><P>
<B>A</b>. Yes, you would be eligible to apply for a leadership award. 
Since these awards recognize the time and work involved in efforts to enable the 
increased participation and advancement of women in academic science and 
engineering careers, partial salary support is an appropriate request. In your 
proposal, describe in detail the activities upon which the Leadership Award 
funds will be spent and submit a plan of action, including a description of 
methodology and specific measurements for assessing progress.</P>

<P><B>Q. I am a member of a professional society that has been 
active in defining and encouraging practices in our discipline that have a 
positive impact on retaining women in academic positions in the field. Can we 
submit a leadership proposal to support the work we do through the professional 
society on this issue?</b></P><P>
<B>A. </b>Yes, leadership awards are intended to enable awardees to 
sustain, intensify, and initiate new activities designed to increase the 
participation and advancement of women scientists and engineers in academe. 
Professional societies that have defined approaches to improving the climate for 
women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's advancement to the 
highest ranks of academic leadership can submit proposals to support their work 
on this issue.</P>

<P><B>Q.  I am a founding member of a program that assists women to achieve 
their research and professional goals. Its current focus is on the recruitment, 
training, retention and advancement of women faculty. Since this program was 
publicly announced two years ago, the positive response from women faculty in 
the community has been overwhelming. I am finding that the time needed to run 
the organization is far more than I had estimated, taking valuable time away 
from my research program and from my work with students and postdocs Can I 
request funding for a leadership award to release me from a portion of my 
teaching and service in the department so that I can focus my time and energy on 
the program for women without the effort having a detrimental effect on my 
research?</b></P><P>
<B>A. </b>Yes, the Leadership awards provide flexibility to applicants to 
define how best to use the funds, including maintenance of an active research 
program and/or laboratory for an individual who is devoting time to activities 
that target increased participation and advancement of women faculty members</P>

<P><B>Q.  I am conducting research on what enhances the performance 
of females in science and engineering. Can I submit a proposal through the 
middle school where I am employed, or the school district in which it is 
located, for an ADVANCE Leadership award to support this research?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> Leadership awards are intended to support academic institutions 
of higher learning that award degrees in a field supported by NSF, professional 
societies, or other not-for-profit organizations. Please refer to the Program 
Solicitation Section III, Eligibility Information. NSF does support research on 
learning and on the issues that affect the participation of girls in science and 
engineering. In the Division of Human Resources Development, the Program for 
Gender Equity (http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/EHR/HRD/pge.asp) supports research and 
intervention programs focused on the participation of females in science and 
engineering. Some programs in the Division of Social and Economic Sciences 
(<A href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/">https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/</A>) and in the 
Division of Behavioral and Cognitive 
Sciences  (<A href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/"> https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/</A>) support research on what accelerates or impedes the participation of females in science and engineering. You may also wish to consider the Research on Learning and 
Education (ROLE) Program, which supports research on science, mathematics, 
engineering and technological (SMET) learning in formal and informal educational 
settings (<A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/nsf0017/nsf0017.html">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/nsf0017/nsf0017.html</A>). </P>

<DIR>
<P><B>Q.  Is salary support an allowable component of the Leadership 
awards?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> Yes, provided it is integral to the activities described in the 
proposal.</P>

<P><B>Q.  Are institutional matching funds required for this 
program?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> There is no matching funds requirement for the Leadership 
awards.</P>

<DIR>
<P><B>Q.  The ADVANCE guidelines state that the notification date 
for awards is January 31, 2002. What would be the start date for a grant?</b></P><P>
<B>A.</b> The January notification date is only for the Fellows part of 
ADVANCE.</P>

          <p>NSF expects to notify Leadership and Institutional Transformation awardees 
            during the summer of 2001. NSF anticipates start dates of September-October 
            2001 for these awards.</p>
