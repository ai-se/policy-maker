      <div class="user_input">
        <p>In furtherance of the President's Management Agenda, in Fiscal Year
          2005, NSF has identified 23 programs that will offer proposers the
          option to utilize Grants.gov to prepare and submit proposals. Grants.gov
          provides a single Government-wide portal for finding and applying for
          Federal grants online. </p>
        <p>Proposers may opt to submit proposals in response to this Program
          Solicitation via <a href="http://www.grants.gov/">Grants.gov</a> or
          via the NSF <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/fastlane.jsp">FastLane</a> system. </p>
        <p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation
          and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
        <ol start="1" type="A">
          <li> Collaborative Proposals. As stipulated in the Eligibility Information
              Section of this Solicitation, collaborative proposals must be submitted
              by one lead organization (and may include one or more subawards.)
              These types of proposals must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Proposers are advised that collaborative proposals submitted in response
              to this Program Solicitation via Grants.gov will be requested to be
              withdrawn and proposers will need to resubmit these proposals via FastLane.
              (Chapter II, Section D.3 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional
            information on collaborative proposals.)</p>

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>The Directorate for Biological Sciences announces plans to continue
          its support of research coordination networks designed to foster communication
          and promote collaboration among scientists with common interests from
          a broad background across disciplinary, geographical, and organizational
          boundaries. The ultimate objective is to move a field forward or to
          create new research directions or opportunities through increased research
          coordination and networking. It is anticipated that this program will
          contribute to further advances in all areas of biological sciences
          under the purview of the Directorate for Biological Sciences at the
          National Science Foundation. Past RCN awards can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/rcnactive.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/rcnactive.htm</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>Support will be provided for groups of investigators to communicate
          and coordinate their research efforts across disciplinary, organizational,
          institutional and geographical boundaries. The objectives are to facilitate
          open communication and exchange of information and resources, to integrate
          research activities of scientists working independently on topics of
          common interest, to nurture a sense of community among young scientists,
          and to minimize isolation and maximize cooperation so as to eliminate
          unnecessary duplication of efforts. Specific features of the program
          include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Topic/focus of research coordination. The research coordination
              network/group will have a common theme as a focus of its activities.
              For example, the focus could be on a research question, a specific
              group of organisms, or particular technologies or approaches. All
              well-justified, cohesive proposals designed to advance a field of
              research under the purview of the Directorate for Biological Sciences
              (BIO) at NSF through research coordination will be considered. Please
              note that BIO does not support biomedical research.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Principal investigator
              (PI). Although the research coordination networks are expected
            to involve investigators from multiple sites, a single organization
              must serve as the submitting organization for each proposal. The
              PI is the designated contact person for the group and is expected
              to provide leadership in fully coordinating and integrating the
            activities of the group. Strong, central leadership and clear lines
            of responsibility are essential for successful networking.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Group members.
                  The size of a group/network is expected to vary depending on
              the theme and the needs of the proposed activity. The group may
              be regional, national, or international. It is expected that a
              proposed group will involve investigators at diverse organizations.
              The inclusion of new researchers, post-docs, graduate students,
              and undergraduates is encouraged. Specific efforts to increase
              participation of underrepresented groups must be included. In the
              proposal, an initial, core group of participants should be identified.
              However, there should be clearly developed mechanisms to maintain
              openness, ensure access, and actively promote participation by
              interested parties outside of the initial core group of participants
              in the proposed network.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>International participation. Biology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century
                is global in character and it is expected that many RCN projects
                may include international participants. In RCN projects with
          an international scope, NSF funds may be used for: </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Travel expenses for US scientists and students participating
                in exchange visits integral to the RCN project</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>RCN-related
                expenses for international partners to participate in networking
                activities while present as a visitor in a participating US host
                laboratory</p>
            </li>
            <li> RCN-related expenses for US participants to conduct
                  networking activities in the international partner&rsquo;s
            home laboratory</li>
          </ul>
          <p>NSF funds may not be used to support the expenses of the international
              scientists and students at their home organization. However, these
              are important activities and NSF encourages the international partners
            to secure support for their efforts from their own national programs. </p>

                of the specific roles and responsibilities of the Coordinator and
                other members of the group/network. Mechanisms for allocating funds,
                such as a steering committee, should be clearly articulated. The
                plan should include provisions for flexibility to allow the structure
                of the group to change over time as membership and the network's
                foci evolve. Mechanisms for assessing progress and the effectiveness
            of the networking activities should be part of the management plan.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Information and material sharing. The goals of this program are
                to promote effective communication and to enhance opportunities for
                collaboration. Proposers are expected to develop and present a clearly
                delineated understanding of individual members rights to ideas, information,
                data and materials produced as a result of the award that is consistent
                with the goals of the program. When the proposed activity involves
                generation of community resources such as databases or unique biological
                materials, a plan for their timely release and the mechanism of sharing
                must be described in the proposal. In addition, a plan for long-term
                maintenance of such resources must be described without assuming
            continued support from NSF.</li>

          <p>The following exceptions and additions to standard Grant Proposal
            Guide proposal preparation instructions apply to proposals submitted
            in response to this Program:</p>
          <p><strong>FastLane Cover Sheet:</strong> Select this program solicitation
            number from the pull down list. The RCN program will automatically
            be selected. An informative title for the proposed project, that
            begins with &quot;RCN:&quot;, must be provided. Entries on the FastLane
            Cover Sheet are limited to the principal investigator and a maximum
            of 4 co-principal investigators. Additional co-principal investigators
            should be listed on the Project Summary page and entered into FastLane
            as Senior Investigators (this latter provision allows their biographical
            sketches to be included in the FastLane proposal). For more FastLane
            instructions see section D below.</p>
          <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> May not be more than one page in
            length, must consist of three parts: (1) a list of core network participants
            along with their home organizations; (2) a succinct summary of the
            intellectual merit of the proposed project including the goal of the
            proposed network, major planned networking activities, and mechanisms
            for actively promoting participation by all interested parties; and
            (3) the broader impacts of the proposed work. Proposals that do not
            separately address both intellectual merit and broader impacts will
            be returned without review.</p>
          <p><strong>Project Description (maximum 15 pages):</strong> The following
            exceptions and additional items should be noted.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>&quot;Results from Prior Support&quot; need not be included unless
                  the proposed activity is clearly a logical extension of an
              activity supported by NSF ((see the Special Information and Supplementary
                  Documentation section below). In the case of such an extension,
                  describe (up to 5 pages to be counted within the 15-page limit)
                  the prior activity and how it relates to the proposed activity.
                  Please note that a renewal proposal to continue essentially
              the same activities of the original RCN project will receive a
              low priority.</li>
            <li>In addition
                    to objectives, rationale, justification and research coordination
                    activities, all special features outlined in Section II.
              Program Description above should be addressed including:</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Management plan. Describe plans and procedures for the development
            and assessment of the proposed activity. Include formal mechanisms
            to ensure fair and equitable allocation of group resources. Clearly
            define the responsibilities for leadership and the role of the PI and
            clearly state the roles for all core participating scientists. Delineate
            the procedures used for the selection of initial core group members,
            and the plans for maintaining an appropriate degree of openness and
            for encouraging the involvement of additional interested parties. Means
            for self-evaluation of progress toward the network goals should be
            presented as an important part of the management plan.</p>
          <p>Coordination plan. If the proposed network will work with an established
            network or group, or if there is a similar activity being planned or
            ongoing in other countries, describe the plans for coordination and
            cooperation among the relevant networks.</p>
          <p>Information and material sharing. Give careful consideration to issues
            related to intellectual property rights and materials sharing in the
            management plan. For example, if the proposed activity is expected
            to result in community resources (such as databases or collections
            of biological materials), present a clear plan for sharing of these
            resources not only among the network participants but with the scientific
            community at large. Address in the proposal plans for determining authorship
            or proper attribution of credit for peer-reviewed or other publications,
            Internet resources, etc. that may be expected to result from the activity.</p>
          <p>Increasing diversity. A research coordination network is an important
            opportunity for encouraging the involvement of underrepresented minority
            investigators and investigators located in a diverse range of organizations.
            Describe (1) a well designed plan to increase participation of members
            of under-represented groups that is specific to the proposed project;
            (2) a plan to involve investigators at a variety of organizational
            settings; (3) if applicable, a plan to include new researchers, post-docs,
            graduate students and undergraduates; and (4) how the plans for increasing
            diversity are integrated with the proposed project plan.</p>
          <p><strong>Budget:</strong> Provide yearly budgets for the duration of
            the proposed project. When subawards are involved yearly budgets are
            required for each subaward. FastLane will generate cumulative budgets
            for the primary and subaward organizations. Budget justification (of
            up to three pages) is required. Organizations ineligible to submit
            to this program solicitation may not receive subawards. If they are
            part of the proposed network, their participation is expected to be
            supported by non-NSF sources.</p>
          <p>Allowable costs for international collaboration are described in Section
            II. Program Description.</p>
          <p>Funds may be requested to promote collaborative activities, such as
            short visits among member laboratories, exchange visits of students,
            sharing of unique facilities, establishment of a public web site, network
            retreats, partial support of workshops uniquely tied to the network
            activities, etc. Any well-justified activity that fulfills the goals
            of the Program will be considered. Innovative ideas for implementing
            novel networking strategies to promote research collaborations and
            enable new research directions or advancement of a field are especially
            encouraged. The PI's of the RCN awards will be asked to attend a meeting
            of the network coordinators to be held at the National Science Foundation
            every two years beginning in FY2007. Include the necessary travel costs
            for attendance at the meeting in the proposed budget.</p>
          <p>Full negotiated indirect cost rates will apply for awards under
            this Program. Note that funds requested to support activities of
            the network participants, such as participants travel, materials
            and supplies for the network projects, and network retreats should
            be listed on Line F &quot;participant support&quot; in the proposed budget, and managed
            by the submitting organization. Under this solicitation, indirect costs
            (F&amp;A) are not allowed on participant support costs.</p>
          <p>Funds from this program may not support independent, individual research
            projects of the participants; nor are they to be used as a mechanism
            for a mini-grant awarding program.</p>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</a>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </p>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=iin127">Important
          Notice 127</a>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</p>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </ul>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </ul>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</p>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </ul>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      </ul>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Ad Hoc
        and/or panel review. </p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation,
        or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends
        when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
      <a name="awardadmin"></a>
      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special
        provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto;
        (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense,
        on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific
        approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal
        referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions,
        such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration
        Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or
        other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards are administered in accordance with
        NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions
        (CA-FATC). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit
        NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and
        have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>
      <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/</a>.
        Paper copies of these documents may be obtained from the NSF Publications
        Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
      <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained
        in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
