      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National
          Science Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and
          applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to
          strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF
          supports facilities which provide research capabilities in various
          scientific disciplines. One such facility, the National Astronomy and
          Ionosphere Center (NAIC), provides instrumentation for research in
          radio astronomy, planetary radar, and terrestrial aeronomy. The mission
          of NAIC is to:</P>

          <LI>Provide forefront observing capabilities in radio astronomy, radar
            astronomy, and atmospheric sciences, and observing support to US
            scientists on the basis of merit and regardless of institutional
            affiliation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Acquire, analyze, archive, and disseminate observational astronomical
            and aeronomical data,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Lead the development of new instruments and techniques,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Support scientific staff who conduct research in the above areas
            for its intrinsic value, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>

            and aeronomy education, and public awareness of science,&nbsp;at
            all levels.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>NAIC is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)
          funded by NSF, and is currently managed through a cooperative agreement
          with Cornell University. NSF's governing body, the National Science
          Board, has adopted the principle that NSF awards should, on occasion, &nbsp;be
          competed to assure the best use of NSF funds for supporting research
          and education. Through this program solicitation, NSF's Division of
          Astronomical Sciences (AST)&nbsp;hereby solicits proposals for management
          and operations of NAIC beginning October 1, 2005 and continuing through
          a five-year award period. </P>
        <P>During the award period for which proposals are&nbsp;being solicited,
          the management and operation of NAIC will include maintaining and upgrading
          existing facilities, incorporating new facilities currently under construction,
          and planning for future new initiatives. </P>

      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>A. Description of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center</p>
        <p>NAIC`s principal research facilities are located on approximately
          120 acres of Government-owned land in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto
          Rico, at an approximate latitude of 18 degrees North and an approximate
          longitude of 67 degrees West. The Center`s main instrument is a 305-meter
          diameter, fixed spherical reflector located at the observatory site,
          some 10 miles inland from the city of Arecibo. The antenna is used
          for radio and radar astronomy and for upper atmospheric physics research;
          it is the world`s largest radio/radar telescope. It was recently equipped
          with aberration-correcting Gregorian optics and is outfitted with a
          suite of state-of-the-art, low-noise receivers which cover frequency
          bands ranging from 400 MHz to 10 GHz. A 1 MW S-band (2380 MHz) radar
          system is available for solar system studies, and a 430 MHz incoherent
          scatter radar serves as a key instrument for atmospheric research.
          Several lidars are located on-site as well. Further details about NAIC`s
          facilities and operations may be found on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.naic.edu/">http://www.naic.edu</a>.</p>
        <p>NAIC administers observing time to the astronomy and aeronomy&#160;communities
          via competitive observing proposals; evaluation and allocation of observing
          time for&#160;up to 100 observing proposals per year is a significant
          component of NAIC management.</p>
        <p>NAIC administers educational and public outreach programs at all levels.
          These programs include observing support for graduate students, Research
          Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers
          (RET), Web-based public outreach, and operating and maintaining the
          state-of-the-art NAIC visitor center.</p>
        <p>Of the total five-year award of&#160;$70,000,000,&#160;approximately&#160;$60,000,000
          will be&#160;provided by the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST),
          and approximately $10,000,000 will be&#160;provided by the&#160;Division
          of Atmospheric Sciences (ATM).&#160; AST supports the&#160;basic operations
          of the Arecibo Observatory, while ATM provides incremental support
          for&#160;use of the facility for research in ionospheric and upper
          atmospheric physics.&#160; In FY 2003, AST provided about 82% of the
          Center`s $13.2 million operating budget and&#160;ATM provided&#160;about
          14% of the budget. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
          (NASA) provided about 4% of the budget to support S-band planetary
          radar operations.&#160; NASA support will be phased out by the end
          of FY 2005, after which&#160;the S-band radar&#160;program will be
          taken over by AST.</p>
        <p>FY 2003 expenditures&#160;were as follows (in millions of dollars):</p>
        <p>Operations and management support, AST.............................
          $10.93</p>
        <p>Increment for upper atmospheric research, ATM.......................
          $ 1.80</p>
        <p>Increment for radar astronomy, NASA .....................................$
          0.50</p>
        <p>B. Description of Awardee Responsibilities</p>
        <p>The awardee will be responsible for the overall welfare of NAIC and
          for maximizing the benefits to the astronomical community of the resources

        <p><strong>Page Limits:</strong></p>
        <p>While the GPG specifies a 15 page limit for the Project Description,
          for this solicitation the limit is 50 pages.&#160; For potential new
          awardees, a transition plan is required (see below).&#160; This plan
          should be included as an appendix not to exceed 10 pages.&#160;</p>
        <p><strong>Who May Submit:</strong></p>
        <p>Proposals for the management and operation of NAIC may be submitted
          by U.S. academic institutions, non-profit organizations, for-profit
          organizations, or consortia thereof, subject to the qualifications
          outlined in the GPG.</p>
        <p><strong>General Information:</strong></p>
        <p>For additional information&#160;on NAIC, the competition for its management,
          and NSF's practices and policies regarding its National Centers, please
          contact the cognizant program officer.&#160;&#160; A visit to NSF may
          be arranged if desired by the prospective manager.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Copies of the current NAIC Program Plan and the current cooperative
          agreement for the management of NAIC will be made available upon request.&#160; A
          detailed list of property for which the current awardee is responsible
          will be provided at the NAIC informational site visit (see below).</p>
        <p><strong>Informational Site Visit:</strong></p>
        <p>NSF/AST/ATM is prepared to arrange a one-day site visit&#160;at the
          Arecibo Observatory for prospective managers prior to the submission
          of proposals.&#160; The purpose of this visit is to provide&#160;proposers&#160;an
          opportunity to inspect the site and gather information relevant to
          the development of a proposal.&#160; The site visit will be held during&#160;the
          third week in January 2004 (January 20 through 23, 2004), and should
          be arranged through the cognizant program officer.&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
        <p>Proposers shall provide all staffing and budgeting information needed
          to describe how proposers will fulfill the expectations in Sections
          I and II of this solicitation. Requested budget amounts for each year
          of the proposal should reflect the level considered necessary to perform
          the activities described in the proposal. Proposers should also be
          cognizant of budget constraints implied by the funding levels provided
          for FY 2003 under the current cooperative agreement, as described in
          Section II, Program Description.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Proposing organizations other than the current awardee must also provide
          a detailed transition plan and budget for the 12 month period preceding
          the new award.&#160; If a new awardee is selected to operate&#160;NAIC,&#160; the
          incumbent&#160;will cooperate with the successor to the extent necessary
          to facilitate uninterrupted support for NAIC during the transition
          period and&#160;will provide transfer of legal rights to relevant property
          and equipment. NSF will support appropriate transition costs by a successor
          awardee if different from the current awardee.</p>
        <p>Each proposal should address the proposing organization's scientific,
          technical, and managerial qualifications to operate NAIC, and should
          include the following:</p>
        <p>1.) A Management and Transition Plan.</p>
        <p>This plan must fully describe the proposed organization for NAIC.
          Particular attention should be given to oversight and user-feedback
          mechanisms and to mechanisms for interacting with the larger astronomical
          community.&#160; Mechanisms for reviewing and scheduling user access
          to NAIC must also be described.</p>
        <p>The plan must identify and provide professional biographical information
          for persons identified as Key Individuals, such as directors and heads
          of units within NAIC. The current managing organization for NAIC is
          Cornell University. Except for positions defined for Key Individuals,
          the proposing organization must agree that all NAIC employees of&#160;Cornell
          as of&#160;September 30, 2004, will be offered employment by the proposing
          organization at salary rates equivalent to those being paid by&#160;Cornell
          at the time of the offer of employment. Proposing organizations may
          propose as Key Individuals persons currently employed by&#160;Cornell
          in those or other positions.</p>
        <p>A proposing organization must agree to recognize employees' length
          of service within&#160;Cornell to meet service credit requirements
          for vacation, sick leave, health insurance, severance pay, group insurance,
          and any other benefits.&#160; Proposing organizations must also agree
          to assume liability for current retiree benefits as previously granted
          by&#160;Cornell and must describe benefits for future retirees. Costs
          for guaranteeing such benefits must be included in the proposal budget.
          Proposing organizations must likewise recognize the currently certified
          collective bargaining agents and their existing agreements and must
          accept responsibility and accountability for existing commercial and
          regulatory obligations of&#160;Cornell on behalf of NAIC, including
          (but not limited to) insurance policies, banking agreements, permits
          and licenses, subcontracts, purchase orders, etc.</p>
        <p>2.) A Scientific Program Plan</p>
        <p>The proposal must describe the expected scientific themes to be&#160;carried
          out&#160;by visiting&#160;scientists and by the scientific staff.&#160; This
          plan must explain how the management of NAIC is directed toward accomplishing
          scientific objectives and how the priorities for these objectives will
          be determined.</p>
        <p>3.) A Technical Program Plan</p>
        <p>The proposal must describe the technical needs of&#160;NAIC in order
          to accomplish the scientific objectives. This includes plans for maintenance
          of existing capabilities, including the telescope, instrumentation,
          computer systems, etc. This also includes plans for upgrades of existing
          facilities or development of new capabilities, including major new
          instruments. Such development plans must include associated budgets
          and clear explanations of what technical accomplishments can be included
          within base budgets and which will require budget increments based
          on future proposals. The proposal must describe mechanisms to be used
          for prioritizing capabilities and new initiatives. It must also explain
          how NAIC would implement partnerships with US universities and non-Federal
          observatories which could enhance observational capabilities available
          to the entire community.</p>
        <p>4.) An Education and Outreach Plan</p>
        <p>The proposal must describe planned education and public outreach activities
          at all levels. Staffing and budget details must be sufficient to show
          clearly which activities are included within proposed base budgets.</p>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      <UL>
        <A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></A> <B>Additional Review Criteria</B>:
        <P>In addition to individual reviews of each proposal by outside experts,&nbsp;a
          panel will be convened to assess the relative merits of all proposals
          submitted and provide a rank ordering for consideration by the NSF
          Program Officer.&nbsp; All proposers will be required to make a presentation
          to the panel and answer questions from the panel, in a "reverse site
          visit" to be held at the NSF offices in Arlington, VA.&nbsp; For this
          solicitation, the following additional and specific review criteria
          will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>The quality of the proposing organization's overall vision for
            NAIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The degree to which scientific programs, priorities and technical
            capabilities reflect the needs of the US astronomical community,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The suitability, quality and cost effectiveness of the management
            plan for operating and maintaining NAIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The extent and quality of specified educational programs,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The extent and quality of specified research and education activities
            which will enhance diversity in the US astronomical community, including
            gender, ethnic, racial and geographic diversity,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The suitability, experience, and professional stature of key management
            individuals, both within the proposing organization and within NAIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>The proposing organization's experience in operating scientific
            facilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>

        </UL>
        <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and
          signed by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential
          documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers,
          are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program
          Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of
          the decision to award or decline funding.</P>
      </UL>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc Review
        followed by Panel Review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

          will be made available upon request sent to the cognizant program officer

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <div class="user_input">
        <DL>
          <DT>The managing organization will be required to provide annual program
            plans, annual long range plans, and quarterly reports for both the
            astronomy and aeronomy programs at NAIC. In addition, as a requirement
            under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the NSF
            is required to report on the Federal Performance Goals for Facilities.
            Any and all facilities with an annual budget exceeding a specific
            threshold must report on their operations activities; and any and
            all construction/upgrade projects that exceed a total project cost
            of a specific threshold must report on their construction/upgrade
            activities. Therefore, awardee will be required, upon request of
            the cognizant NSF program officer, to submit annual reports related
            to the GPRA performance goals. This may include the collection and
            submission of specific data related to the NSF GPRA requirements. </DT>
        </DL>
      </div>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
