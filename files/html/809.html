      <div class="user_input">The National Science Foundation&nbsp;has played 
        a role in the development and deployment of large-scale networks (NSFNET, 
        vBNS, Internet2/Abilene Network) for science and engineering research 
        and education. As a result,&nbsp; the pace of science research increased, 
        enabling more rapid creation and distribution of new knowledge and increased 
        communication between collaborating scientists. 
        <P>NSF also encourages and supports the development of novel technologies

      <div class="user_input">
        <P>The Strategic Technologies for the Internet program is designed to 
          stimulate the development of critical infrastructure that advances the 
          conduct of science using commodity and/or advanced research networks.&nbsp;</P>
        <P>In some instances, single investigator projects will be appropriate;&nbsp;in 
          others, it may be necessary to mount a larger team effort.&nbsp; All 
          proposals must provide a convincing rationale and justification for 
          the level of effort proposed. Most awards are anticipated to fall between 
          $50,000-$300,000 per year for up to three years.&nbsp; Requests for 
          projects ranging in size up to $1 million per year for up to three years 
          will be considered if the merit of the proposed activities justifies 
          such an investment. For example, a project that clearly shows exceptional 
          promise to narrow or close an existing&nbsp;infrastructure gap may warrant 
          investment of up to $1 Million /year for 3 years. </P>
        <P>The focus areas for FY 2003 are:&nbsp;</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Advanced applications for the Internet, particularly collaboration 
            tools, remote instrumentation control and access and grid-based applications,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Techniques for identifying and reducing vulnerabilities in the Internet 
            and advanced networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Performance enhancements including techniques for dramatically improving 
            end-to-end throughputs or latencies and&nbsp;new <FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>architectures</FONT>&nbsp;based 
            on integrated research across multiple network layers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>

        <P>Proposers should note that in some cases it may be necessary to assemble 
          a multidisciplinary team to adequately address all aspects of a particular 
          problem.</P>
        <P>The focus here is on&nbsp;activities that promise near-term&nbsp;impact 
          in areas not already covered by other NSF programs. To see about related 
          programs or for&nbsp;projects focusing more on fundamental, theoretical

      <a name="review"></a> <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a> <p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited 
        from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research 
        or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers 
        charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer 
        to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate 
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with 
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic 
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to 
        that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
      <p>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals 
        at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsb9772">NSB 
        97-72</a>). All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit 
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional 
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs 
        and activities. </p>
      <p>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?iin127">Important 
        Notice 127</a>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements 
        Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces 
        the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review 
        of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal 
        processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed 
        when making funding decisions.</p>
      <p>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines 
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. 
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must 
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page 
        Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting 
        from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description 
        and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
      <p>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that 
        do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project 
        Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation 
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance 
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>
      <p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed 
        below (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant 
        Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria 
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are 
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers 
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address 
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered 
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p>
      <ul>
        <b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is 
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, 
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent 
        does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? 
        How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient 
        access to resources?</ul> <ul>
        <b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting 
        teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity 
        broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, 
        disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure 
        for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, 
        and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance 
        scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of 
        the proposed activity to society?
      </ul>
      <p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making 
        funding decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br />
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster 
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects, 
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These 
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently 
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where 
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement 
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br />
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens 
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities 
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. 
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to 
        the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <span class="user_input"> <a name="rev_addl_crit_txt"></a></span> 
      </ul>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a> <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer 
        Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons 
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the 
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation 
        will be reviewed by <span class="user_input"> <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a> 
        Panel Review. </span></p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support 
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
        review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted 
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. 
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are 
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. 
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision 
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals 
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time 
        interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the Division 
        Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and 
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications 
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers 
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, 
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of 
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical 
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator 
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence 
        of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements 
        Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
      <a name="awardadmin"></a> <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a> <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> 
        by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations 
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by 
        the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim 
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be 
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A. 
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a> <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special 
        provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; 
        (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, 
        on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific 
        approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal 
        referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such 
        as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership 
        (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance 
        that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative 
        agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative 
        Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail notification is 
        the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic 
        mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division 
        of Grants and Agreements. </p>

      <a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a> <a name="reportreq"></a> <h4>C. Reporting 
        Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), 
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer 
        at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a> <p> Within 90 days after the expiration 
        of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final project report. 
        Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing 
        of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the 
        formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required 
        data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available 
        through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project 
        reports. This system permits electronic submission and updating of project 
        reports, including information on project participants (individual and 
        organizational), activities and findings, publications, and other specific 
        products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information 
        previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using 
        the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in 
        most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible 
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for 
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such 
        findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and 
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons 
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with 
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of 
        race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded 
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination 
        under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from NSF, 
        although some programs may have special requirements that limit eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> 
        (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
        persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student 
        research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter 
        II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited 
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection 
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted by 
        awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the 
        Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed 
        to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review 
        process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data 
        regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration 
        of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers 
        and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government 
        agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order 
        to coordinate programs; and to another Federal agency, court or party 
        in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a 
        party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer 
        file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers 
        or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, "Principal 
        Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 
        267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated 
        Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998). Submission of the 
        information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, 
        however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
      <p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control 
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public 
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. 
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of this 
        collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, 
        to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of Administrative 
        Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</p>
