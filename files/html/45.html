        <h3>
          IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES
        </h3>
         
          <p>The following changes have been made to the solicitation.</p>
          <p>This solicitation now has TARGET DATES for full proposals.  This means that full proposals are expected to be submitted by the target date.  Anyone requiring some additional time must contact one of the IUCRC program directors for approval to submit after the target date to ensure that the proposal will be considered in the current panel competition.</p>
          <p>Eligibility criteria for submission of a full proposal have been revised. Non-binding preliminary proposals are now required before the submission of a full proposal. Submitters will receive feedback from program staff indicating either "encourage" or "discourage". An "encourage" finding generally indicates that the proposal appears to be responsive to the IUCRC Program Guidelines and is a candidate for further development relative to the IUCRC solicitation. A "discourage" finding generally indicates that the project is typically not responsive to the IUCRC Program, or has serious conceptual flaws and requires further development for an IUCRC submission. The feedback provided pursuant to the preliminary proposal is advisory only; submitters of both "encouraged" and "discouraged" preliminary proposals are eligible to submit full proposals.  </p>
          <p>Language has been added to Section I: "Introduction" to clarify NSF's goals for the Program. Specifically, NSF aims to help the formation of nationwide Centers that are new and that address industry needs not already covered by existing IUCRCs or other industry/university consortia/centers. Principal Investigators (PIs) should review the IUCRC Center Directory found on the Program's webpage to identify potential overlaps prior to proposing a new Center. In the event of a potential overlap, PIs should consider joining the already existing IUCRC.</p>
          <p>Description of eligibility for Phase II and Phase III has been clarified under Section Eligibility Information: "Eligibility to submit a Phase II or Phase III Site renewal proposal is dependent upon that Site in the Center having satisfactorily completed the previous Phase award. This includes demonstrating meeting the minimum membership and membership fees requirements and being in compliance with IUCRC Program requirements under the current IUCRC award. This criteria does not apply to new Sites proposing to join existing Phase II and Phase III Centers."</p>
          <p>Description of eligibility of a University's related organizations under Section II: "Program Description/Industrial Support" has been clarified. Any entity in any way financially affiliated with any of the Universities that are part of an IUCRC can be a paying member of that Site/Center. The entity's membership fee does not count towards the minimum membership requirement for the Site/Center, but is considered Program Income. Examples are University's Foundations, University's subsidiaries, etc."</p>
          <p>Length of the Project Description for a Site Proposal to join/form/renew an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is now limited to 15 pages. <strong>
            </strong></p>
          <p>Sites seeking to form a new IUCRC or to renew to Phase II or Phase III may have common sections related to the description of the Center (up to 5 pages of the Project Description), but each proposal must be Site specific.</p>
          <p>Specific instructions have been added for proposed Sites/Centers that have potential geoscience relevance. PIs are required to discuss with the GEO Topic Specific IUCRC Program Director(s) and relevant Program(s) in the Directorate for Geosciences prior to submission of the preliminary proposal. Both project summary and project description in full proposals must include text that mentions which Division(s) and Program(s) in the Directorate for Geosciences are relevant to the Site/Center and how the pre-competitive research proposed by the Site/Center will enhance that Division(s) and Program(s) scientific mission.</p>
          <p>Under Section III: "Award Information":</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Evaluators are now called "assessment coordinators"</li>
            <li>Description of the eligibility to request additional funding for a subsequent phase has been modified. The additional requested amount is equivalent to half of the total in-cash only (not in-kind equivalent) membership fees collected in excess of the required minimum during the current operating Phase (excluding any University financially affiliated membership and/or cash contributions to the Site/Center), not to exceed $50,000 per Site, per year.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Under Section V: "Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions/Full Proposal Preparation Instructions:"</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Language has been added to clarify that proposals from multiple Sites seeking to form a new IUCRC or to renew to Phase II or Phase III may have common sections related to the description of the Center (up to five pages of the Project Description), but each proposal must be Site specific and must discuss the value brought by the Site to the Center.</li>
            <li>Under "(2) Guide to Submission of a Site Proposal to join/form an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center"<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Instructions on how to title proposals have been added</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Proposal Format - Center Proposal - Supplementary Documents:<br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Under item B, references to other Sections of the solicitation have been corrected, and language has been added to clarify the requirement for Sites seeking a renewal to Phase II or Phase III</li>
                    <li>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among all the Center's Sites participating in the IUCRC is required. The MOU describes how Sites plan to operate the Center, share administrative and managerial responsibilities and their costs, handle the collection of the membership fees and the distribution across sites based on the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) allocation of projects, and the arrangement among the University Financial Offices for the annual certification of the collected membership fees and their sources at each Site. This MOU must be posted on the public portion of the Center Website.</li>
                    <li>Description of NSF funds usage under Budget Sheet has been clarified.</li>
                    <li>Supplementary documents for Sites adding to an existing Center, and Sites seeking to renew to Phase II and Phase III have been modified. Sites must include the bylaws in use by the Center.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Under Section VII. "Award Administration Information/Subsection C. "Reporting Requirements", the description of the "Certification of membership" has been clarified. Certifications for centers that are collecting membership fees centrally by one of the IUCRC's Sites must report fees and their sources at each Site consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among all the Center's Sites and with NSF award budget periods.</p>
          <p>An existing Center in year 2 or 3 of the current Phase that wishes to transfer to the new funding model can do so by submitting proposals (one per existing Site) that clearly demonstrate that all Sites under the umbrella of the existing Center have been meeting the new model requirements since the last reporting period. Proposals will be reviewed using the same review criteria listed in Section VI.A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria. If successful, and subject to availability of funds, those Centers/Sites will receive a new award for the reminder of the Center's current Phase. All future increments on current Centers/Sites' awards will be withheld and current awards ended at the anniversary of the current increment. In the event a grantee has unexpended program income remaining at the end of the grant, it must be remitted to NSF by crediting costs otherwise chargeable against the grant. If it is not possible to record the credit via ACM$, the excess program income must be remitted to NSF electronically or by check payable to the National Science Foundation. Instructions have been added under Section V: "Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions/Full Proposal Preparation Instructions:/(2) Guide to Submission of a Site Proposal to join/form an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center/Proposal Format - Center Proposal".</p>
          <p>New Sites planning to join existing Centers operating under the previous solicitation model must meet the requirements of this solicitation.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC) program develops long-term partnerships among industry, academe, and government. The Centers are catalyzed by an investment from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and are primarily supported by industry Center members, with NSF taking a supporting role in the development and evolution of the Center. Each Center is established to conduct research that is of interest to both the industry members and the Center faculty. An IUCRC contributes to the nation's research infrastructure base and enhances the intellectual capacity of the engineering and science workforce through the integration of research and education. As appropriate, an IUCRC uses international collaborations to advance these goals within the global context.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p dir="ltr" align="left">The Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC) Program strives to develop long-term partnerships among industry, academe and government to promote research programs of mutual interest, contribute to the nation's research infrastructure base, enhance the intellectual capacity of the engineering or science workforce through the integration of research and education, and facilitate technology transfer. The IUCRC program seeks to achieve these goals by:</p>
          <ul dir="ltr">
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
          Leveraging NSF funds with industry to support graduate students performing industrially relevant pre-competitive research;
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
           Expanding the innovation capacity of our nation's competitive workforce through partnerships between industries and universities; and
            </li>
            <li>
             Encouraging the nation's research enterprise to remain competitive through active engagement with academic and industrial leaders throughout the world.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposals for IUCRCs addressing any precompetitive research areas identified among the science and technology priorities for the nation are welcome and will be fully considered. To meet national needs, multi-university IUCRCs are preferred to single-university IUCRCs because multi-university Centers contribute to an increased research base as well as to increased interaction among Center participants. The Centers are catalyzed by an investment from NSF with primary support derived from the private and public sector. NSF takes a supporting role in the development and evolution of the IUCRC, providing a framework for membership and operations as well as requirements derived from extensive Center experience and evaluation. </p>
          <p>NSF invests in nationwide Centers that do not overlap in research foci with existing IUCRCs. PIs should review the IUCRC Center Directory found on the Program's webpage <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/</a> for potential overlaps prior to proposing a new Center. In the event of a potential overlap, the PIs should consider joining the already existing IUCRC. NSF's goal is to help the formation of centers that are new and that address industry needs not already covered by existing IUCRCs or other industry/university consortia/centers.</p>
          <p>As appropriate, NSF encourages international collaborations that advance these goals within the global context.</p>
       
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>A comprehensive range of disciplines and skills is often necessary to address research issues of interest to industry, and thus it is often necessary to form a consortium of universities to achieve a critical mass of interdisciplinary research capabilities for the formation of an IUCRC. The NSF encourages multiple universities to come together to form an IUCRC, with each university constituting a Site of the Center. The Center is a "virtual" entity, with a defined leadership spanning the Center's constituent Sites.</p>
          <p>An Institution that wants to be part of a Center applies to become an NSF IUCRC Site. Upon award, this Site will become part of the Center. If this is the only Site within the Center, then it will be a single Site IUCRC with the corresponding membership obligations. If there are additional Sites that are or can be part of the Center, then the new Site will be part of a multi-Site IUCRC. </p>
          <p>The first stage in forming an IUCRC involves the successful completion of an IUCRC planning grant. Planning grants for Site additions to existing IUCRCs may be waived by NSF, provided the proposed research Site meets the minimum membership and financial requirements and has the approval of the leadership of the existing IUCRC.</p>
          <p>Upon successful completion of the Planning Grant, the proposed Site of the Center submits an application to join the Center in its current Phase. New IUCRCs start at Phase I that lasts five years. This initial five year period of support allows for the development of a strong partnership between the academic researchers and interested industrial and government parties. A significant amount of the Center's financial support is expected to come from industrial, state, and other funds. As a Center progresses, it is likely to have increased opportunities for funding from additional firms, other federal agencies and laboratories, and state and local governments; thus, increasing the leverage of NSF funds. After five years, Sites within Centers that continue to meet the IUCRC Program requirements may request support for a second five-year (Phase II) period. Phase II grants allow Centers to continue to grow, and to leverage and diversify their memberships and research portfolio during their Phase II period. After ten years, Sites within Centers may apply for a third five-year (Phase III) period. Phase III awards are provided for Centers that demonstrate significant impact on industry research as measured through robust and sustained membership, student impact, annual reports, site visits, and adherence to IUCRC requirements. Centers are expected to be fully supported by private and public partners after fifteen years as an IUCRC.</p>
          <p>All Sites within a Center may apply for a Phase II (years 6 through 10 of the Center) grant if each Site meets the Phase II minimum requirements specified in the solicitation as well as having satisfactorily completed the Phase I grant.</p>
          <p>All Sites within a Center may apply for a Phase III (years 11 through 15 of the Center) grant if each Site meets the minimum Phase III requirements specified in the solicitation as well as having satisfactorily completed the Phase II grant.</p>
          <p>A Site joining an existing Center will apply for the current Phase of the Center. For example, if a Center is in Phase II, the Site can only apply to join that Center provided it meets the minimum Phase II requirements specified in the solicitation. Similarly, if a Center is in Phase III, the Site can only apply to join that Center provided it meets the minimum Phase III requirements. New Site awards are limited to the remaining duration of the Phase of the Center (for example, if founding Sites of the Center were awarded three years prior to a new Site coming onboard, the new Site will receive funds for only the two years that remain in the duration of that Phase).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Membership fee requirement levels (per Site) are: </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Sites in a multi-university Center:</p>
            <p>Phase I: a minimum of $150,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 3 distinct full members.</p>
            <p>Phase II: a minimum of $200,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 4 distinct full members.</p>
            <p>Phase III: a minimum of $250,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 5 distinct full members.</p>
            <p>Single University Center in any Phase: a minimum of $400,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually with a minimum of eight distinct full members.</p>
            <p>Note: The minimum membership requirement by a Site is met with in-cash memberships only (no in-kind cash equivalent can be applied towards the minimum). To assure potential economic as well as scientific impact, IUCRCs are encouraged to have companies comprise the majority of the Center members.</p>
            <p>Note: The same member may purchase memberships at multiple Sites within a Center. However, the member will only be counted as one full or associate member at one site within the center.</p>
            <p>Note: A Company for which any faculty involved in the Center is the founder, president, a key officer or a majority shareholder can be a member but its membership does not count towards meeting the minimum membership requirement for that Site. It is incumbent on the faculty involved in this company to ensure compliance with the conflict of interest policies of his/her respective Institution, and to ensure that the IAB is aware of such conflicts as well.</p>
            <p>Note: Any entity in any way financially affiliated with any of the Universities that are part of an IUCRC can be a paying member of that Site/Center. The entity's membership fee does not count towards the minimum membership requirement for the Site/Center, but is considered Program Income. Examples are University's Foundations, University's subsidiaries, etc.</p>

          <p><strong>Other requirements of an IUCRC include reporting and evaluation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>IUCRC Sites are required to submit reports as specified in Section VII. Award Administration Information, Subsection C. Reporting Requirements.</li>
            <li>IUCRCs have an independent assessment coordinator assigned by NSF. This person's role is to provide NSF with an external independent assessment of Center activities and progress, and collect NSF-required Center data. Centers are required to provide all necessary data and materials to the Center assessment coordinator in a timely fashion, so that the assessment coordinator can fulfill his/her responsibilities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All Centers and their associated Sites must comply with IUCRC Requirements found on the NSF IUCRC Program's webpage <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>International partnerships:</strong></p>
          <p>Collaboration with international research entities can advance IUCRC goals within the global context. An established IUCRC may submit a supplement request for collaborative work with an international research entity constituting the formation of an international Site of the IUCRC. These supplements are to be used for travel and coordination across the various Sites within the U.S. and the international Site. These supplements are only supported for one year at a time. In order to continue the international collaborative partnerships, the IUCRC must submit a supplement request each year that outlines the outcomes and benefits realized by the international partnership in the prior award period. In addition, the supplement request must articulate clearly the plans for the coming year, and must contain evidence of the continued interest by the IAB in the international partnership. An IUCRC must demonstrate strong adherence to IUCRC program management principles amongst its US-based Sites before applying for this supplement.</p>
          <p>Any request to establish an IUCRC international collaboration should seek guidance and pre-approval from the Cognizant IUCRC Program Officer prior to submission of an international supplement request.</p>
          <p dir="ltr" align="justify">Each IUCRC is limited to one supplement per year per country to support an international Site.</p>
          <p dir="ltr" align="justify"><strong>Supplements to enhance IUCRC goals in training and education</strong></p>
          <p>To advance IUCRC goals within the education mission, an IUCRC may request individual supplements to support research experiences for undergraduate students (REU), veterans (VRS), and teachers (RET) involved in Center research activities.

          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The support of the NSF-appointed assessment coordinator is managed independently by NSF.</p>
          <p><strong>Planning Grant Awards for New Centers and Sites - Standard Grant
            </strong></p>
          <p>The award amount for a planning grant seeking to establish a new IUCRC is $15,000 per academic institution with a 12 -month duration. The $15,000 is for all applicable planning expenses including travel to the IUCRC "boot camp&rdquo; and is inclusive of applicable Indirect Costs. The IUCRC &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; informs planning grant awardees about the planning process, the IUCRC model, member recruitment strategies and Center operations that are consistent with IUCRC requirements.</p>
          <p><strong>Full Center Awards - Continuing or Standard Grant</strong></p>
          <p>Multi-Site IUCRC proposals are given preference over single Site IUCRC proposals. For successful IUCRC proposals, NSF provides up to 15 years of funding, in three Phases. Each Phase has a duration of five years (or less for Site additions to an existing Center). NSF support is intended to augment the support that a Center receives from industry and other sponsors. IUCRC support is available for Centers and their affiliated Sites that fully meet the IUCRC operational and membership requirements.</p>
          <p>NSF uses the following funding formula:</p>
          <p><em>Phase I - First Five Year Center Award</em><br />
            Site meeting minimum membership requirement receives $150,000 annually from NSF.</p>
          <p><em>Phase II - Second Five Year Center Award</em><br />
            Site meeting minimum membership requirement receives $100,000 annually from NSF.</p>
          <p><em>Phase III - Third Five Year Center Award</em><br />
            Site meeting minimum membership requirement receives $50,000 annually from NSF.</p>
          <p>Phase I and Phase II Sites that exceed minimum membership requirements during their five years of operations (or less for any Sites added to existing IUCRCs) are eligible to request additional funding for the subsequent Phase. The additional requested amount is equivalent to half of the total in-cash only (not in-kind cash equivalent) membership fees collected in excess of the required minimum during the current operating Phase (excluding any University financially affiliated membership and/or cash contributions to the Site/Center), not to exceed $50,000 per Site, per year.</p>
          <p>Example: If a Phase I Site receives $1,200,000 in cash membership fees over a five year period ($450,000 over the minimum membership fees), the Site will then be eligible to receive an additional $225,000 at the time of the Phase II renewal ($45,000 per year)  Similarly, if a Phase II Site receives $1,200,000 in cash membership fees over a five year period ($200,000 over the minimum membership fees), the Site will be eligible to receive an additional $100,000 at the time of the Phase III renewal ($20,000 per year).</p>
          <p>NSF funds should be used towards management and operations of the IUCRC. Each Site of an IUCRC is expected to use the NSF funds to participate in the administrative and managerial costs of the overall IUCRC and of its Site and/or to take on some of those responsibilities and cover the costs. If any NSF funds are used to conduct research, they must be in line with the goals of the Center and directed only towards pre-competitive research projects approved by the IAB.</p>
          <p>Membership fees received by the Center and Sites are considered program income.  At least 90% of the IUCRC program income must be used to support direct costs of the research, and up to 10% may be used to support indirect costs.</p>
          <p>Continued NSF support is contingent upon fulfilling BOTH operational AND membership requirements of an IUCRC. NSF may withhold future continuing grant increments (<em>CGIs</em>) and adjust the award end date for any Site that does not meet these requirements in the first year of any Phase, or twice within any ward period. </p>
          <p><strong>International IUCRC Support</strong></p>
          <p>To advance IUCRC goals within the global context, an IUCRC may receive a $25,000 supplement annually for an international Site. These funds are to be used for expenses related to the international activity including support for research visits by IUCRC Site director(s), other faculty, students and junior researchers. No NSF funds are to be used by non-U.S. based participants.</p>
          <p>International supplemental funding is allowed in all years, including Year 1.</p>
          <p><strong>Additional Supplemental opportunities</strong></p>
          <p>To advance its training and education mission, an IUCRC in good standing may request supplements for research experiences for undergraduate Students (REU), up to a maximum of $8,000 per student, veterans (VRS), up to a maximum of $10,000 per student, and teachers (RET), up to a maximum of $10,000 per teacher. No supplement should be submitted without prior approval of the cognizant IUCRC program officer. Requests should be received no later than April 30th each year and are subject to budget availability. No REU, VRS, or RET supplement requests will be accepted between May 1st and September 30th of each year.</p>

        <p>Proposed Centers and Sites that have potential geoscience relevance should be discussed with the GEO Topic Specific IUCRC Program Officers and relevant Programs in the Directorate for Geosciences for guidance and approval prior to submitting a Preliminary Proposal.</p>
        <p>Submitters will receive feedback from program staff indicating either <strong>encourage</strong> or <strong>discourage</strong>. An <strong>encourage</strong> finding generally indicates that the proposal appears to be responsive to the IUCRC program guidelines and is a candidate for further development relative to the IUCRC solicitation. A <strong>discourage</strong> finding generally indicates that the project is typically not responsive to the IUCRC program, has serious conceptual flaws and requires further development as an IUCRC submission. The feedback provided pursuant to the preliminary proposal is advisory only; submitters of both &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; and &ldquo;discouraged&rdquo; preliminary proposals are eligible to submit full proposals.</p>
        <p>Submission of a Preliminary Proposal is required to be eligible to submit a Full Proposal. Preliminary proposals must be submitted, via FastLane, by 5 p.m. proposer's local time on the due date for preliminary proposals.</p>

        <p><strong>(2) Guide to Submission of a Site Proposal to join/form an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center</strong></p>
        <p>To be eligible to submit a full Site Phase I proposal, either to form a new Center or to join an existing Center, a Site must have been awarded a planning grant (unless planning requirement was waived by NSF). In addition, the Site must submit a Preliminary-Proposal indicating its interest in submitting a Site Phase I proposal.</p>
        <p>Note: The requirement for a planning grant proposal for Site addition to an existing Center, may be waived by NSF provided the proposed research Site meets the minimum membership requirements and has the approval from the academic leadership team and the IAB to join an existing Center. In instances where planning meetings have been waived by NSF, proposals must clearly spell out the mechanism/process used to align the proposed Site(s) to the needs of new and existing IAB members, and the process used to identify industry-vetted research projects that appear in the proposal(s).</p>
        <p>Site proposals to transition to the next Phase of the IUCRC require the successful completion of prior Phase awards, which includes meeting memberships and membership fees requirements as well as demonstrating Site's adherence to IUCRC Program's requirements.</p>
        <p>The title for the proposal must be: "[Phase] IUCRC [Site Name]: Center for [AREA]" where [Phase] is the requested Phase, [Site Name] is the name of the Institution, and [AREA] is the research area for which the Center is being proposed.</p>
        <p><strong>Proposal Format<br />
          </strong></p>
        <p>A Phase I proposal should reflect how the Site will bring value to the unique combination of the proposed Center's research interests, capabilities, and potential for working with industry.</p>
        <p>A Phase II or Phase III proposal should show Site outcomes and continuing plans for the realization of its potential through application of IUCRC Requirements and achievement of Center goals and objectives. These features should be discussed in sufficient detail to facilitate review in accordance with the IUCRC Program requirements.</p>
        <p>Proposals by Sites that are part of existing Centers awarded under the old IUCRC funding model and in year 2 or 3 of their current Phase that wish to transfer to the new IUCRC Program funding model (introduced with solicitation NSF 16-504) must clearly demonstrate that all Sites under the umbrella of the existing Center have been meeting the new model requirements - including minimum membership requirements - since the last reporting period. Sites should also show plans for the continuing realization of their potential through application of IUCRC new model requirements and achievement of Center goals and objectives.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" align="justify"><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
        <p>As specified in Chapter II, Section C.2.b of the NSF PAPPG, the proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one page in length.

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
       
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
    
        <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>Preliminary Proposal </strong></em>will be considered by NSF staff based on the economic importance of the research area, the depth and breadth of the proposed Center's research, the readiness of the team/Site, the adherence to IUCRC Program's requirements and whether the proposed research overlaps other IUCRCs.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Site Planning grant proposals and full proposals </strong></em>will be competitively reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, and/or Internal NSF Review. The proposals will be subject to the NSF merit review criteria and the additional criteria given below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The envisioned Site and the overall Center are consistent with the defining characteristics and operational requirements of an IUCRC.</li>
          <li>There is enough potential university support, faculty, and facilities involved to build a viable Site within the framework of the Center.</li>
          <li>The planning study will effectively focus on the research interests of an industry that is in a position to support the Site and therefore the Center, so that it could meet the requirements to submit a Site proposal.</li>
          <li>The planning study will effectively use IUCRC operational requirements for structuring and operating the envisioned Site and Center.</li>
          <li>The Site and the Center have an effective marketing plan to develop a strong contingent of firms and sufficient member support to be successful and meet the IUCRC criteria.</li>
          <li>The Site and the Center overall propose to develop a research program that does not duplicate that of an existing IUCRC Center and/or Site (see <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/directory/index.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/directory/index.jsp</a> for potential overlap).</li>
          <li>The proposal requires cross-disciplinary and cross-departmental participation where appropriate to the research envisioned.</li>
          <li>The NSF reviewers will consider the extent to which there is evidence that the Site will meet the "Requirements of an IUCRC" as described in Section II. Program Description.</li>
          <li>For IUCRCs involving international collaborations, reviewers will consider: mutual benefits, true intellectual collaboration with the foreign partner(s), benefits to be realized from the international partner's expertise and specialized skills, facilities, Sites, and/or resources of the international counterpart, and active research engagement of U. S. students and early-career researchers, where such individuals are engaged in the research.</li>
          <li>Phase II and Phase III Site proposals will be reviewed as to the Site's previous achievement of NSF's broader impacts, significance and impact of Site's previous research, and efforts of the Site and overall Center in communicating with the public and all Center members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>This special award term supersedes in its entirety Article 27, Program Income, of the Grant General Conditions.</p>
        <p>Program income is defined at 2 CFR 200.80.  Program income received or accruing to the grantee during the period of the grant is to be retained by the grantee, added to the funds committed to the project by NSF, and thus used to further project objectives. The grantee has no obligation to NSF with respect to program income received beyond the period of the grant. The grantee also shall have no obligation to NSF with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under a grant (see AAG Chapter III.D.4). However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 USC 18) shall apply to inventions made under a grant. See also FAQ 200.307.1 of the Frequently Asked Questions for The Office of Management and Budget&rsquo;s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards at 2 CFR &sect; 200 regarding Fees and Royalties and Bayh-Dole.</p>
        <p><strong>NSF hereby clarifies that for the purposes of the IUCRC Program, "project" has always been defined as IUCRC Center research activities. On an annual basis, each Site must demonstrate how such funds have been used to further project objectives. </strong></p>
        <p>Membership fees received by the Center and Sites are considered program income.  At least 90% of the IUCRC program income must be used to support direct costs of the research, and up to 10% may be used to support indirect costs.</p>
        <p>Efforts should be made to avoid having unexpended program income remaining at the end of the grant. In the event a grantee has unexpended program income remaining at the end of the grant, it must be remitted to NSF by crediting costs otherwise chargeable against the grant. If it is not possible to record the credit via ACM$, the excess program income must be remitted to NSF electronically or by check payable to the National Science Foundation.</p>
        <p>The amount of indirect costs for NSF funds should be calculated by applying the current negotiated indirect cost rate(s) to the approved base(s).</p>
        <p>Prior to the start of each funding period, the Program will review each Site on a number of renewal criteria including the following:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Attendance of all stakeholders at the bi-annual IAB meetings</li>
          <li>Meeting membership requirements noted below</li>
          <li>Timely submission of comprehensive annual reports to the NSF</li>
          <li>The degree of collaboration amongst Center Sites;</li>
          <li>The extent to which the marketing plan is being pursued;</li>
          <li>The extent to which the industry/university collaborations are growing;</li>
          <li>The extent to which the industrial research program is developing; and</li>
          <li>The extent to which technology transfer is occurring from the Center to one or more members of the Center.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Membership fee requirement levels (per Site):</p>
        <p>Sites in a multi-university Center: <br />
          Phase I: a minimum of $150,000 in cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 3 distinct full members. <br />
          Phase II: a minimum of $200,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 4 distinct full members. <br />
          Phase III: a minimum of $250,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually and 5 distinct full members.</p>
        <p>Single University Center in any Phase: a minimum of $400,000 in-cash (no in-kind cash equivalent) annually with a minimum of eight distinct full members.</p>
        <p>Note: Minimum membership requirement by a Site is met with in-cash memberships only (no in-kind cash equivalent can be applied towards minimum). To assure potential economic as well as scientific impact, IUCRCs are encouraged to have companies comprise the majority of Center members.</p>
        <p>Note: A Company for which any faculty involved in the Center is the founder, president, a key officer or a majority shareholder can be a member but its membership does not count towards the minimum membership requirement. It is incumbent on the faculty involved in this company to ensure compliance with the conflict of interest policies of his/her respective Institution, and to ensure that the IAB is aware of such conflicts as well.</p>
        <p>Note: Any entity in any way financially affiliated with any of the Universities part of an IUCRC can be a paying member of that Site/Center. The entity's membership fee does not count towards the minimum membership requirement for the Site/Center, but is considered Program Income. Examples are University's Foundations, University's subsidiaries, etc.</p>
        <p>Note: The same member may purchase memberships at multiple Sites within a Center.  However, the member will only be counted as one full or associate member at one Site within Center.</p>
        <p>Continued NSF support is contingent upon fulfilling BOTH operational AND membership requirements of an IUCRC. NSF may withhold future continuing grant increments (<em>CGIs</em>) and adjust the award end date for any Site that does not meet these requirements in the first year of any Phase, or twice within any award period. </p>
        <p>If the review is satisfactory, the Program Director may recommend support for the next period of the continuing award.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>The Site annual report is used as a basis for assessing annual performance and determining continued funding. Incomplete reports are not accepted by NSF.</p>
        <p>The complete annual report contains information on the IUCRC Site&rsquo;s research goals met and anticipated for next year, collaborations with other universities (if applicable), major accomplishments, communications and decision making (how does the Center interact and communicate with Center members, how are the research programs planned and selected, periodic updates of the IUCRC Directory at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc</a>, etc.)</p>
        <p>The Annual Report contains information on the IUCRC Site and of the overall Center:</p>

        <p>Please make sure to enter content of your report in the various sections. You may upload PDF files with images, tables, charts, specific research project updates, etc., in support of each section. The SRO-signed membership certification for the reporting period compiled using the SRO Membership Certification Template and the Assessment Coordinator Report must be uploaded under "Special Requirements". "Participants" must list all individuals who contributed to the Center activities for the performing period, including students, postdocs, companies, etc. Outcomes should describe impacts generated by the Center including but not limited to students graduated and hired by the member companies, technology transferred to member companies, etc.</p>
        <p><em>Assessment Coordinator's report</em> <br />
          Assessment Coordinators are expected to produce an annual report that incorporates information obtained via participant observation, surveys of faculty and industry, and exit interviews. Additional information about the Assessment Coordinator's role, responsibility and data gathering instruments can be found at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/</a> under the "Assessment Coordinators" Link.

Complete list of the information is found on the IUCRC webpage <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/</a>.</p>
        <p><em>Center Director's report</em> <br />
          The Center Director is expected to provide a brief (5 pages maximum) annual report on the state of the overall Center, assessing the current health and targeted growth of the Sites, faculty participation rates and overall satisfaction with Center activities amongst the students and faculty as well as the impact within the institutions. Director&rsquo;s report must be uploaded with each Site annual report</p>
        <p><em>Certification of Membership</em> <br />
          The certification is the form SRO Membership Certification Template compiled by the University Sponsored Research Office (SRO) handling the IUCRC Site that affirms the execution of membership agreements and details the receipts of annual cash and in-kind membership fees or other program income. Membership fees reported are the ones for which the membership agreement was fully executed and paid during the NSF reporting period. Certifications for centers that are collecting membership fees centrally by one of the IUCRC's Sites must report fees and their sources at each Site consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among all the Center's Sites.</p>
        <p><em>IUCRC Directory Reporting</em> <br />
          IUCRCs are required to provide accurate and up -to-date information that NSF can use for the online IUCRC directory at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/directory/index.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/directory/index.jsp</a> .

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
