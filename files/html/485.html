        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) supports research and education activities that invent new computing and networking technologies and that explore new ways to make use of existing technologies. The Division seeks to develop a better understanding of the fundamental properties of computer and network systems and to create better abstractions and tools for designing, building, analyzing, and measuring future systems. The Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) program supports transformative research on fundamental scientific and technological advances leading to the development of future-generation, high-performance networks and future Internet architectures.</p>
            <p>Under this umbrella, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) of Japan have agreed to embark on a collaborative research program to address compelling research challenges that arise from networks supporting future demands of device proliferation and data objects. This NSF solicitation parallels an equivalent NICT solicitation. Proposals submitted under this solicitation must describe joint research with Japanese counterparts who are requesting funding separately under the NICT solicitation.</p>
            <p>This research and development program addresses three specific challenges that arise when environments with trillions of device and information objects are connected via networks. Trillions of network-connected objects are expected to emerge in the global network around 2020. This trend will require novel approaches for network design and modeling, new technologies to manage and control object mobility, and new and more flexible networks with the speed, capacity and environmental characteristics needed to accommodate communications among objects in the emerging world.</p>
            <p>This program seeks joint Japan-US research projects that leverage each nation's expertise and address these challenges via work in three areas:</p>
            <p>1. <em>Network Design and Modeling</em><em>: </em>Addressing the design, modeling and component interaction challenges associated with increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous network technologies and applications at scale.</p>
            <p>2. <em style="font-style: italic">Mobility</em><em>: </em>Addressing issues such as security, control, provisioning, naming, discovery, and fast mobility in a world in which mobility is driven by factors such as social networks, the Internet of things, and cyber-physical systems.</p>
            <p>3. <em style="font-style: italic">Optical Networking</em><em>: </em>Finding novel approaches for sustainable high&#8208;speed, high&#8208;capacity, and energy-efficient networks that will accommodate communications required in &quot;beyond trillions of devices and information objects&quot; situations. </p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>The US NSF's Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) of Japan have a history of collaboration that extends back several years. The NICT has tracked the NSF-funded Global Environment for Networking Innovation (GENI; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.geni.net/">http://www.geni.net/</a>) project since its inception in 2007, and in 2010 the two agencies jointly funded a set of Japan-US proposals in the area of future Internet design. These projects helped establish new collaborations among researchers from both countries.</p>
          <p>In 2012, NSF and NICT officials reviewed prior efforts and discussed possible future joint programs organized around common interests and complementary strengths. The overarching area that emerged was the support for advanced Internet architectures, and in particular support for an Internet where trillions of objects are connected to, and accessed from, a mobile world. Under this heading, in November 2012, Japanese and US principal investigators gathered in Tokyo to discuss topics in the general areas of optical networking, mobile computing, and network design and modeling as these were felt to be important components of the future Internet. On the basis of the workshop output (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://netrel.umkc.edu/usjw2012/">http://netrel.umkc.edu/usjw2012/</a>), NSF and NICT moved forward to establish a second Japan-US joint research and development program.</p>
          <p>This &quot;Beyond Trillions of Objects&quot; Japan-US joint research and development program addresses a critical subset of the issues that arise when environments with trillions of device and information objects are network-connected, as is expected to be the case by the year 2020. This trend will require novel approaches for network design and modeling, new technologies for network management and control in support of object mobility, and flexible networks with the speed, capacity and environmental characteristics needed to accommodate communications among objects in the emerging world. This program seeks joint Japan-US research projects that address these challenges.</p>
        
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>Proposals are solicited for joint Japan-US foundational and transformative research consistent with the theme of &quot;Beyond Trillions of Objects&quot; in the following three areas:</p>
          <p><strong>1. Network Design and Modeling</strong></p>
          <p>We seek joint Japan-US projects exploring the design and modeling implications of increasingly dynamic, heterogeneous network technologies and applications at scale. The needs of network design and modeling are driven by the dramatic increase in numbers of users, applications, services, data objects, and physical devices. There are diverse access technologies, an expanding role of data centers, a dynamic edge consisting of mobile devices, sensors and &quot;things,&quot; and an increased emphasis on energy utilization and green networking. Network utilization patterns are becoming increasingly dynamic due to the interaction with overlays, such as social networks, yet the current design and modeling methods are based on quasi-static network models. Proposals addressing problems arising out of these challenges are sought, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Models and analysis frameworks for self-organized or evolved networks;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Models incorporating adaption in response to mobile network use patterns, such as social networks, content sharing patterns, and the responses of cyber-physical systems to changing environments; and</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Impacts on modeling and analysis of new network architectures that make explicit use of cross-layer management information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2. Mobility</strong></p>
          <p>We seek joint Japan-US projects exploring the mobility protocols and architectures needed to support novel applications and services at very large scale and spanning heterogeneous and high-density networks. Challenges associated with such mobility protocols and architectures include scalability and metrics, security and privacy, service composition, naming and addressing, resource management, mobility management, federation of heterogeneous resources, testing and validation, system control, and interfaces with cloud computing and content delivery. Examples of relevant areas include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Architectures that provide or support integration of personal communications, sensing, and computing for dense, highly mobile devices and data sources;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Security and privacy frameworks that are relevant to mobility architectures where the number of networks, number of devices, and number and sources of data exceed the administrative capabilities of today's networking paradigms;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Novel methods for integrating cloud computing with small mobile devices; and</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Scalable resource management for a world of trillions of mobile terminals, services, and objects.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3. Optical Network Architectures </strong></p>
          <p>We seek joint Japan-US optical networking projects that address challenges related to the flexible and reliable provisioning of bandwidth in support of dynamic capacity demands, simplification of network design and modeling tasks, and energy efficiency. While the network architectures will likely include a mixture of switching technologies, dynamically provisioned or switched optical networks are believed to be the most cost- and energy-efficient for higher-volume traffic. Challenges include energy-efficient mechanisms for multi-granular optical services, dynamic resource allocation mechanisms for switching, traffic classification in high-speed networks in support of routing and switching decisions, and other topics relevant to dynamic provisioning of bandwidth. These challenges arise from both the growth in bandwidth required to support the data volumes implied by trillions of objects and from the increasingly dynamic traffic matrices implied by device mobility and the interaction with social and content networks. Energy efficiency and reliability is required for both environmental reasons and because communication networks may be required to operate for extended periods  of time without direct support from electrical grids (e.g., during periods of disaster recovery or for remote locations). Example projects include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Architectures for dynamically provisioned, energy-efficient and high-reliability optical core, access and data center networks;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Methods for assigning data transfers to the appropriate network layer, i.e., switched layer-1, switched layer-2, or layer-3, with at least one layer optical; and <br />
            </li>
            <li>Novel optical node architectures supporting the above objectives.</li>
          </ul>
       
        
        <h3> <a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
         
          <p>For each project the US and Japanese teams will be funded by the NSF and the NICT, respectively, through separate NSF and NICT funding instruments. For each project, NSF support will be provided via a NSF grant, and NICT support will be provided either via a contract entered between NICT and a research institute under NICT's extramural Commissioned ICT Research and Development Program or via a new opportunity under NICT's intramural R&amp;D funding program for NICT researchers. It is anticipated that approximately 6 to 8 projects, each up to $300,000 over three years, will be made to US participants, pending the availability of funds.</p>

        <p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
        <p>Collaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. Chapter II, Section D.4 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Proposal Preparation Information: </strong>FastLane will check for required sections of the full proposal, in accordance with <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG) instructions described in Chapter II.C.2. The GPG requires submission of: Project Summary; Project Description; References Cited; Biographical Sketch(es); Budget; Budget Justification; Current and Pending Support; Facilities, Equipment &amp; Other Resources; Data Management Plan; and Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan, if applicable. If a required section is missing, <strong>FastLane will not accept the proposal. </strong></p>
        <p>Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions. If the solicitation instructions do not require a GPG-required section to be included in the proposal, insert text or upload a document in that section of the proposal that states, &quot;Not Applicable for this Program Solicitation.&quot; Doing so will enable FastLane to accept your proposal.</p>
        <p><strong>In addition to the guidelines in the GPG or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide, proposal preparation instructions specific to the preparation of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are provided below:</strong></p>
        <p>It is expected that the Japanese researchers taking part in the joint research project will submit proposals separately to NICT in accordance with NICT's guidelines and procedures. US researchers will submit to NSF in accordance with NSF's guidelines and procedures. Proposals must be coordinated; it is expected that the Project Summary, Project Description, References Cited, Biographical Sketches, Collaboration and Management Plan, Intellectual Property Plan, and List of Personnel will be identical in both the NSF and NICT submissions. Bibliographies must include not only the references relevant to the work to be undertaken by US principal investigators but also those relevant to the work to be undertaken by their Japanese counterparts. Furthermore, Biographical Sketches for both the researchers to be funded by NSF and the researchers to be funded by NICT must be included in the proposals submitted separately to NSF and NICT. US Principal Investigators taking part in a joint research project are expected to coordinate their NSF submissions with their Japanese counterparts' NICT submissions.</p>
        <p>The following information supplements the guidelines provided in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proposal Titles: </strong>Proposals for this solicitation require titles that begin with &quot;NeTS: JUNO:&quot; followed by project-specific text.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Description:</strong> The Project Description is limited to 15 pages. <strong><em>Please note that per guidance in the GPG, the Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. You can decide where to include this section within the project description.</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Required Supplementary Documents: </strong>In the Supplementary Documents Section, the lead institution should upload the following information (not part of the project description and need only be submitted by the lead institution):
            <ul>
              <li><em>Collaboration and Management Plan</em>: In a supplemental document (up to 3 pages), describe a comprehensive collaboration and management plan: identify the project manager who will take responsibility for overall project coordination and management and who will serve as the contact PI for the project; describe management and research responsibilities for the project; define the expected contributions of each of the PIs and provide a convincing case that the collaborative contributions of the project team members will be greater than the sum of each of their individual contributions; describe mechanisms for integrating and managing all organizations and individuals involved in the project and exposing students or junior faculty to their counterparts in Japan; and provide a timeline for the proposed effort and identify the parties responsible for each major task. The length of, and degree of, detail provided in the Collaboration and Management Plan should be commensurate with the complexity of the proposed project but must be sufficient to ensure that the US and Japan project elements will work together as an integrated project.<em>  <strong>If a proposal does not include a Collaboration and Management Plan, of up to 3 pages, that proposal will be returned without review.</strong></em></li>
              <li><em>Intellectual Property Plan</em> (up to 1 page): In a supplemental document, provide assurance that an agreement covering issues such as intellectual property has been or will be established within a reasonable time after the notifications of awarded projects. Such an agreement should satisfy the policies and practices of each Participant.</li>
              <li><em>Personnel</em>: A<strong> </strong>list of PIs, co-PIs, senior personnel, collaborators, paid consultants, and post-doctoral researchers who will be involved in the project, including both US and Japanese personnel. The personnel information provides NSF and reviewers with a comprehensive list of personnel and institutions involved in the project, and will be used when determining conflicts of interest in the review process.

        <a name="review" id="review"></a><h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot;  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
              </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
              </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
              </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
       <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to the merit review principles and criteria described above, JUNO proposals will also be evaluated by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The extent to which the proposed work supports the solicitation theme of &quot;Beyond Trillions of Objects.&quot;</li>
          <li>The extent to which the work and collaboration plans describe a unified project between the US and Japanese participants.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>NSF will manage and conduct the review process of proposals submitted in accordance with NSF standards and procedures. Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. Following, and based upon the results of, independent and parallel review processes by NSF and NICT, program managers at the two agencies will discuss recommendations. During this discussion, NSF and NICT program managers may share unattributed reviews (i.e., the reviews will not include reviewer identities) with one another. The NSF Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of both the U.S. and Japanese review processes and the results of the discussions with NICT program managers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program.

        <p>Grantees of this program will be expected to attend, and should budget for, annual grantee review meetings for the purpose of sharing research progress with representatives of other projects funded under this solicitation as well as NSF and NICT representatives and other persons designated by NSF and NICT. The first such meeting will be held approximately 9 months after the awards are made, and succeeding meetings will be held every 12 months thereafter. </p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
