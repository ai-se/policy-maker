<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote>NSF seeks to support NSFAYS Projects that will create, implement, evaluate, and disseminate effective models to attract K-8 students to, prepare them for, and retain them in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, leading to an increase in the pool of students continuing in STEM coursework in high school and considering careers in STEM fields. Models must be built on sustainable partnerships of formal and informal education providers, business/industry, and Colleges of Education. The Foundation solicits highly innovative projects that expose students to innovative out-of-school time (OST) learning experiences that demonstrate effective synergies with in-school curricula, and take full advantage of the special attributes of each educational setting in synergistic ways. Projects should structure highly motivational experiences for students while providing essential STEM preparation. Professional development for classroom teachers and OST education providers will be critical to the success of NSFAYS Projects. The portfolio of NSFAYS Projects is intended to explore a variety of implementation models in urban, rural and suburban settings representing diverse student populations. This portfolio of projects, taken as a whole, should inform NSF and the broader educational community of what works and what does not, for whom, in what settings. One NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center will be funded to provide research and evaluation support for the NSFAYS program. It is anticipated that the Center will synthesize research emerging from the funded NSFAYS Projects and have responsibility for national dissemination of program models, findings, and best practices.</blockquote>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Recognizing the importance of K-12 education as essential to the pathway to STEM careers, in November 2005, Congress required NSF to initiate a K-8 demonstration program &ldquo; &hellip; to provide seed money for new projects with the goal of increasing the pool of individuals pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers through programs that catalyze and maintain interest of K-8 students in math&#91;ematics&#93; and science.&rdquo; It asked that the projects stimulate interest and provide exciting, but challenging education experiences in mathematics and science that are continuous and seamless from initial contact and throughout high school, and that each project involve sustainable coalitions of industry/business, colleges of education, and educational agencies.&rdquo; (House Report 109-272.) The National Science Foundation is directly responding to House Report 109-272 through the development of this solicitation, NSF Academies for Young Scientists (NSFAYS).</p>
<p>All too often, U.S. students become disengaged from science and mathematics at the elementary level, long before they have an opportunity to enroll in courses that lay the foundation for continued study in high school and pathways to STEM careers (National Science Resource Center, 1996). The NSFAYS program seeks to create innovative strategies that show promise for increasing the number of students continuing the study of STEM disciplines in high school and beyond through the development, evaluation, and dissemination of models that link students, teachers, educational agencies, and community partners. By providing a trajectory of experiences that capitalizes on the synergy of out-of-school time (OST) and classroom experiences and stimulates interest in mathematics and science, it may be possible to increase participation in study of these disciplines and hence the potential pool of workers in the STEM pipeline (Congressional Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology, 2000).</p>
<p>Ideally, students should have access to a series of incremental STEM opportunities that begin at the elementary level and continue seamlessly as they progress through their secondary academic careers. Complementary enrichment activities that are supportive of school-based STEM curricula and standards offer opportunities for in-depth learning and engagement beyond the school day through participation in after-school, weekend, and summer programs. NSFAY is intended to lay the foundation for such programs by providing funding for innovative OST experiences for students and teachers, grades K-8, that forge significant connections with and enhancements to in-school STEM programs.</p>
<p>Studies reveal that the longer student involvement in OST program activities, the greater the improvement in their academic performance, attitudes toward school, academic motivation, competence, educational aspirations, and college attendance (Little &amp; Harris, 2003). OST programs can also offset a lack of school and community resources that limit student achievement by providing them access to enrichment activities, supplemental classroom experiences, and workforce skills (Miller, 2003). Even more encouraging is that middle school students are often highly engaged in their formal school programs if they participate in robust OST programs. The reports emphasize, however, the importance of well-run, high-quality OST programs and the importance of high attendance rates and multi-year participation levels in achieving positive outcomes (Chaput, Little, &amp; Weiss, 2004; James Irvine Foundation, 2005; Miller, 2003). Academic enrichment programs, such as the ones called for by NSF Academies for Young Scientists, can thus become effective interventions for increasing the number of students in the STEM pipeline.</p>
<p>A primary goal of NSFAYS is to engage students in STEM learning while helping teachers develop and adopt strategies that effectively retain students&rsquo; interests in science and mathematics and help them prepare for secondary level coursework. Research has shown that a number of factors contribute to effective learning, including engagement, motivation, social interactions, and context. Recent STEM education studies highlight the importance of teachers drawing on combinations of traditional and more innovative instructional strategies to increase student learning. These strategies include instruction that directly addresses student preconceptions and/or misconceptions; ensures that learners have a repertoire of organized factual knowledge; engages students in hands-on, activity-based learning; incorporates metacognitive strategies; allows students to experience discrepant events or cognitive dissonance; and engages students in content specific discourse (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000; Minstrell &amp; van Zee, 2000). Implementation of these instructional strategies may promote transfer of STEM knowledge from OST learning to the classroom and vice versa.</p>
<p>Through a well-selected portfolio of demonstrations projects, NSFAYS seeks to develop strategies that respond to local contexts that are representative of the nation. Several key variables must be addressed to ensure that appropriate strategies are incorporated to support underserved and underrepresented students. For example, demographic and sociocultural factors contribute to student learning and academic achievement, particularly in science and mathematics (Barton, 2000, 2001; Tobin, Roth, and Zimmerman, 2001; Oakes, 1990 a,b). Understanding the sociocultural contexts of schools is critically important and especially relevant to teaching and learning in STEM (Kozaitis, 1997, 2000; Lemke, 2001). Also, developing teachers&rsquo; cultural competency is important, although it is rarely incorporated into teacher professional development programs (Brown, 2004; Westby and Torres-Velasquez, 2000). NSFAYS encourages models that incorporate teacher cultural competency as a means to improve STEM interest, learning, and achievement.</p>
<p>Parental involvement is also critical to students&rsquo; academic success. Parents can be powerful mechanisms for sustaining a project if they are effectively engaged and believe the learning opportunities afforded their children to be valuable (Barton, Drake, Perez, St. Louis, &amp; George, 2004; Silver, Berman, &amp; Wilson, 2005). Parent-teacher interactions in ethno-culturally diverse school settings are often problematic due to lack of communication between the project staff and minority parents; misunderstandings regarding differences in goals; and negative views of minority parenting practices on the part of teachers (Bernhard, Lefebvre, Murphy, Kilbride, Chvd, &amp; Lange, 1998). NSFAYS Projects should encourage participatory activities that support high-quality STEM teaching for parents and their children.</p>
<p>NSFAYS requires that communities augment school resources by extending STEM programming through sustained partnerships among schools, business, higher education, and institutions offering informal learning opportunities. Partnerships with museums, science centers, and community-based organizations have been shown to be crucial to the success of a number of exemplary OST programs (e.g., ASTC, 2001; YouthALIVE!). Direct linkages between OST programs, school curricula, school administration, teachers, and parents also promote student success formally and informally. By incorporating proven elements such as parental involvement, teacher cultural competency, leveraging of resources, community partnerships, attention to demographic factors, and opportunities for teachers and students to participate in intensive out-of-school time STEM learning, NSFAYS should provide sustainable models that will continue to bring quality education experiences to participating youth well-after NSF funding ceases.

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p><strong>Program Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The NSF Academies for Young Scientists (NSFAYS) program seeks to create, implement, evaluate, and disseminate effective and sustainable model projects for students and teachers. NSFAYS Projects should focus on contiguous grade bands, and simultaneously address the following three goals:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>
      <p>Increase student interest to pursue further study and potential careers
        in STEM disciplines through OST programs that stimulate motivation and
        provide rigorous learning experiences in out-of-school settings that
        complement school STEM programs. The synergy between OST and in-school
        learning environments should lead to increased conceptual understanding
        and appreciation of the role that the STEM disciplines play in the world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Develop
            and/or deepen lasting partnerships that draw on financial and intellectual
            resources available to communities and that demonstrate the potential
            to sustain the project when NSF funding terminates. Partnerships
        of school districts, Colleges of Education, business/industry, and an
        informal science agency are required.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Involve STEM teachers within relevant
            K-8 grade bands who can serve as the bridge between OST and classroom
            learning in STEM disciplines. The NSFAYS experience should expose
        teachers to new and varied instructional strategies, as well as strengthen
        their understanding of STEM content and processes in ways that have positive
            impacts on the learning of their students.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The portfolio of funded projects is intended to represent varied student populations and community environments to inform the design of similar efforts in localities nationwide. From the portfolio of projects, NSF expects to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p>What models and strategies are most effective at helping K-8 students
        learn STEM disciplinary content in preparation for high school?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What models
            and strategies are most effective at developing and retaining K-8
        students&rsquo; interests
            in learning STEM disciplines, and in encouraging them to consider
        or select STEM careers?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What models and strategies are most effective
            in improving teachers&rsquo; abilities
          to attract, prepare, and retain students in STEM, both in OST and formal
          classroom settings?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>What components and strategies show promise to make
                the supported models scalable to larger audiences and sustainable
                without NSF funds?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A. NSFAYS Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Characteristics</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Rationale/Theoretical Framework/Logic Model</strong></p>
<p>The proposal should provide a clear rationale for the goals and objectives and the project design. This should include the current research base on how students learn, how to implement effective professional development, how to structure effective partnerships, and how to attract students and motivate their interest.</p>
<p>Every project should be based on a theoretical framework, which is composed of a set of principles and relationships. The theoretical framework should be based on familiarity with the literature on strategies for in-school and OST education and how these can be combined in synergistic ways, with consideration of what has worked and what has not worked in the past. The project design should follow logically from the theoretical framework, and should reflect the strategies to be utilized to achieve these goals. In turn, the project activities should follow logically from those strategies. <strong>The tight alignment of goals, theoretical framework, project design/strategies, activities and evaluation constitute the logic model of the project.</strong> Proposals should reference the literature used to inform the project, but the inclusion of general bibliographies is discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>2. Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The proposal should list a manageable number of well-defined, measurable goals and objectives. These should address both achievement in and attitudes about STEM for the target audience.</p>
<p><strong>3. Project Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each NSFAYS Project must include the following four partners:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p>A school district, a consortium of schools within a district, or a consortium
        of districts whose teachers participate in the program and whose formal
        STEM curriculum at selected grade bands provides the foundation for OST
        learning activities. Key personnel from districts might also include
        administrators and academic/career counselors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Business(es)/industry(ies),
            within the community, capable of bringing substantial STEM capacity
        and other resources from outside of the school system(s).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A College of
            Education that prepares and/or certifies teachers. Communities without
            a four-year college could partner with a community college that has
        programs articulating with four-year, pre-service teacher education programs.
            College/university departments in STEM disciplines are encouraged
        to collaborate with their Colleges of Education to contribute professionals
          with needed expertise in STEM content. NSF considers the inclusion
        of STEM content experts and educators critical to the success of NSFAYS
        Projects. NSF funding for stipends for participating pre-service teachers
        can be requested by NSFAYS Projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An informal science education organization
            that, broadly defined, includes (1) science museums, zoos, aquaria,
        botanical gardens, wildlife reserves, and planetariums; (2) youth, community,
        and other OST organizations that have a STEM component, such as 4-H,
        Future Farmers of America, Scouts, YMCA/YWCA, and girls/boys clubs that
        can place STEM experiences in a social context; (3) federal, state, and
        local government agencies and major laboratory facilities; and (4) educational
            support organizations, such as Parent Teachers Association or organizations
            of STEM teachers and professionals (National Science Teachers Association,
            American Association of Physics Teachers, National Council for Teachers
            of Mathematics, etc.).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>NSFAYS Projects must be <strong>local in scope</strong>, and that scope should be reflected in the project goals and objectives, in the target audience, and in the project design. While the impacts must be local, this does not preclude projects from reaching outside the local community to secure essential resources. NSFAYS Projects may be small, with a <strong>minimum of 100 students</strong>, but must demonstrate the potential to be <strong>scaled up</strong> to larger audiences. Participating students should receive a minimum of <strong>150 contact hours</strong> <strong>of OST experiences</strong> during the project. Some of the elements of the project should be generalizable, so that other communities with comparable resources could implement the major features of a project.</p>
<p>The proposal should clearly identify the <strong>target audience</strong> of students that will benefit from the project. It should also identify the target audience of teachers who will receive resources and training, and other categories of personnel (e.g., pre-service teachers, STEM professionals, informal science educators, counselors, school administrators, parents) who might also serve meaningful instructional and/or support roles in the effort. For each audience, the proposal should articulate recruitment strategies and program activities focused on STEM learning objectives specific to that audience. Projects must select students in a <strong>multi-year set of contiguous grades</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>for example, grades 5-8.</strong> NSF requires that all projects provide <strong>professional development</strong> sessions that include personnel involved with planning and delivering student activities: participating teachers, informal educators, participating pre-service teachers, parents, and STEM professionals.</p>
<p>The STEM disciplines that will be the <strong>content focus</strong> of the project should be specified. These could be any of the science disciplines, technology, engineering design, mathematics, or some combination of these disciplines that would be mutually supportive. NSF especially encourages projects that integrate mathematics with other STEM disciplines.</p>
<p>Each NSFAYS Project should propose an <strong>implementation model</strong> that will be the basis for achieving the stated goals and objectives of the program. The elements of the model should include a full description of the partnership, the resources that each partner will contribute, and the unique role each partner will play. The NSFAYS program seeks true partnerships, with each member deeply involved in planning and operating the project, while making significant contributions to the project and receiving meaningful benefits. The history of established partnerships and their state of readiness to run the project should be documented. The project context should be described, including relevant characteristics of the community, existing community resources, and diversity of the relevant student population. A clear description should be presented on how the elements of the model are designed to work synergistically to achieve the goals and objectives.</p>
<p><strong>In-School and OST Experiences</strong></p>
<p>The development of synergies between OST activities and classroom-based STEM programs offered by the school system is considered central to every project. The OST activities must complement, extend, and supplement the in-school STEM curricula. These two types of activities should inform and improve one another. Knowledge and ideas generated by the NSF funded Center for Informal Learning and Schools (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.exploratorium.edu/cils/">http://www.exploratorium.edu/cils/</a>) and other efforts working at the interface of in-school and OST education should inform program design. In this regard, NSF directs proposers to the Centers for Learning and Teaching website at (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.cltnet.org">http://www.cltnet.org</a>). It is expected that projects will include OST experiences during the academic year and summer.</p>
<p>The in-school programs of participating districts must be fully described, including the curriculum used, weekly time allotted to teaching the programs, and the professional development teachers have undergone in preparation to teach the curriculum. The curriculum should incorporate the elements of effective teaching and learning discussed in the introduction of this solicitation and the attached references, and its effectiveness at meeting national and state standards should be documented. The NSFAYS program will not support the purchase of curriculum materials for school use.</p>
<p>The OST activities are expected to be highly motivating experiences that will attract students to participate. Such events as team design activities, career exploration, STEM-related internet activities, student robotics clubs, visits to STEM professionals and their work environments, visits to colleges, student/parent activities, meaningful job shadowing, mentored research projects, and mock professional conferences can provide students with community and social contexts for learning STEM disciplines. Activities on environmental issues in the community could have students working side-by-side with STEM professionals to investigate and present findings through public forums or student newscasts. Involvement of high school students or undergraduate STEM majors and pre-service teachers to assist in activities can be a powerful tool to motivate younger students. This small set of examples illustrates some of the innovative possibilities sought in the NSFAYS program. The connections between the school curriculum and the OST activities should be clearly described. The NSFAYS program will contribute to the purchase of instructional materials for OST experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Materials Development</strong></p>
<p>While NSFAYS is not an instructional materials development program, it may be necessary to modify existing materials or to create new activities to support the level of innovation desired. Proposals should anticipate these needs and describe them clearly. Modest allocations for materials development can be requested as part of the full proposal request from NSF. Projects are strongly encouraged to seek out existing instructional materials, developed and tested in collaboration with STEM professionals and STEM educators. The Appendix at the end of this section provides a short list that illustrates the types of materials that might be used or modified for student activities.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is another essential feature of NSFAYS Projects. NSF seeks knowledge about which project components can be sustained after the period of NSF funding. Such knowledge will help other communities initiate similar projects without NSF funding. NSF funds should be used to catalyze effective, long-term initiatives and/or broaden and deepen existing community efforts. The proposal should describe the specific components that might be sustained and how that might be achieved. The ability of projects to sustain is believed to be related to the following features:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p>Project activities are clearly shown to impact student interest and
        achievement in STEM, as well as strengthen STEM instruction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The creation
            of true partnerships in which all partners play a significant role
        in planning and running the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>All partners receive significant
            benefits from the project, so that it would be in their best interests
            to continue the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>All partners commit resources to the project
            at the highest levels of their organization and write letters of
        commitment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Leadership is broadly distributed throughout the partnership
            and within the individual partners so that the loss of a few key
        individuals will not cripple the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Parents can be a powerful mechanism
            for sustaining a project if the parents have been involved and believe
            it is valuable for their children.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transition to High School</strong></p>
<p>The proposal should describe how the project will prepare students for a smooth transition to high school courses in STEM, preparing them academically and socially for high school expectations. NSFAYS experiences should be developed in light of a careful analysis of these expectations. For example, K-8 students might have experiences working with teams of high school students on laboratory experiments or design projects by visiting high school classrooms. While NSFAYS cannot support students beyond grade 8, it can support planning by high school teachers, academic/career counselors and administrators to facilitate the transition of students to grades 9-12. Furthermore, projects may need access to high school students who have participated in project OST activities in order for the projects to conduct evaluation and research on the impacts of the students' participation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>NSF is committed to increasing the participation of all students in STEM disciplines, especially from those populations underrepresented in STEM. While NSFAYS seeks to fund a variety of projects that, to the extent possible, represent the full diversity of our country, the participants for each NSFAYS Project should broadly reflect the diversity <strong>within their community</strong>. Proposals should clearly identify the diversity of the population to be served and document how special needs will be met. Recruitment plans for students will be especially important. NSFAYS Projects must reach out to girls, minorities, and persons with disabilities that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM educational pathways and professions, presenting plans with special, creative efforts for recruiting and retaining these populations.</p>
<p>Projects will need to recruit other populations, such as teachers, counselors, scientists, parents and others. Recruitment and retention plans for these groups should be described in the proposal. It is desirable for the personnel participating in the project to reflect the diversity of the community.</p>
<p><strong>5. Work Plan</strong></p>
<p>Each proposal should present an action plan with a timeline that clearly addresses the project goals and objectives and organizes the major activities of the project. As part of the overall work plan, proposals should also include a plan to manage the partnership, including meeting schedules, the decision-making and sharing processes, and plans for regular communication among and within the partners.</p>
<p>NSF expects to make awards with start dates in Fall 2006. Projects could use the next several months for start-up activities but should begin full implementation with student activities no later than January 2007. Start-up activities might include initial professional development, recruiting, gathering baseline student data for research and evaluation, team building, and focus sessions for students and parents to inform the project development. Student activities should continue through 2008. Evaluation and research should continue through the end of the projects in Fall 2009. The NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center will continue for another six months to provide time and opportunity to aggregate the final data, complete the analysis, and present findings.</p>
<p><strong>6. Research</strong></p>
<p>Research and project evaluation should be separate components of each proposal, but they should be coordinated whenever possible. The budget for these two components combined should be 10 to 15% of the total project budget.</p>
<p>Each NSFAYS Project must carry out a modest research program to validate the theoretical framework on which the project model is based. While evaluation should measure the outcomes of the project, research should go deeper to determine the reasons those outcomes were achieved and validate or reject the principles of the theoretical framework. The proposal must list the research questions, and describe the methods, instruments, and analyses to be used to answer them. The individuals executing the research must be identified, along with their qualifications. NSFAYS Projects must agree to coordinate their research through, and share their results with, the NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center (see Section II.B).</p>
<p><strong>7. Project Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The plan for project evaluation should include formative (internal) and summative evaluation (external). It should include evaluation of student attitudes and beliefs about STEM as well as measures of achievement in STEM content in comparison to similar populations not impacted by the project. The plan should define the project&rsquo;s success, that is, the specific numerical outcomes that would document success in recruiting, preparing and retaining students in pursuing STEM careers and meeting the project goals. It should identify the measures, instruments, processes and analyses to be used to evaluate those outcomes. The evaluator should be identified in the proposal, and the evaluator&rsquo;s qualifications presented. It is desirable that evaluation be an integral part of the project plan from the start.</p>
<p>Projects must agree to cooperate with the NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center (see Section II.B) that will aggregate data from the projects and form a learning community across projects.</p>
<p><strong>8. Key Personnel</strong>
</p>
<p>The proposal should list the key personnel, at least one from each partner, and their roles and responsibilities in the project. Each proposal should include all individuals that bring the requisite expertise needed to operate the project.</p>
<p>Biographical sketches: Biographical information (no more than two pages) must be provided for each senior person listed on the budget forms, including consultants and advisors. Include career and academic credentials, as well as e-mail and mailing address.</p>
<p>Each project must have an Advisory Board of major community stakeholders, STEM professionals, and educators to monitor and give guidance to the project, and to connect the project deeply within the community. Knowledge of, support for, and participation in the project should be broadly spread throughout the community. The proposal should identify the composition of the Board and its role in the project.</p>
<p><strong>9. Dissemination</strong></p>
<p>The national dissemination of NSFAYS program results will be the responsibility of the NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center. Each NSFAYS Project should provide plans to publicize its activities widely within its community. In addition, any plans to present project results in professional journals or meetings should be included.</p>
<p><strong>10. Prior NSF Support</strong></p>
<p>Project personnel must provide a list of their previous NSF supported projects that pertain to the current proposal, provide evidence of the success of those projects, and explain how lessons learned inform the current proposal. Proposals may also include discussion of projects funded by other agencies that support the current project.</p>
<p><strong>B. NSFAYS Research and Evaluation Center</strong></p>
<p><strong>Center Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>NSF anticipates funding one award (as a cooperative agreement) for a Center to support the goals of this solicitation. The Center will advance the research and evaluation efforts of the projects, help projects align their goals and anticipated outcomes with the program goals, aggregate data and findings from the projects, synthesize those results, and promote national awareness of the models, methods, and research findings that result in students acquiring deeper understanding and more sustained interest in STEM fields. Although each project is local in nature and answers unique questions relevant to that local educational environment, the NSFAYS program, through the Center, will provide a more complete set of findings with national relevance.</p>
<p>It is expected that the lead organization for the NSFAYS Center will be an educational research and development organization or an institution of higher education. The successful proposer must have demonstrated capacity to conduct site-based research, synthesize findings, disseminate to multiple audiences, and manage a national center. It is expected that the lead institution will provide expert knowledge of K-8 STEM education, teacher education, classroom research, and OST education.</p>
<p><strong>1. Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The primary task of the Center is to synthesize the project outcomes and provide models, context for those models, and suggestions for addressing broader national goals. The Center will assist projects in disseminating models and findings, and report on program outcomes and approaches in appropriate forums. It will support dialog among Principal Investigators (PIs) by fostering activities such as web conferences, teleconferences, and other appropriate sessions and events, and have responsibility for national dissemination of program models, findings, and best practices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Center Design</strong></p>
<p>A Center proposal is expected to include a description of how it will work with NSFAYS PIs to identify effective strategies and successful models for stimulating K-8 students&rsquo; interest in STEM and sustaining excitement and growth in STEM knowledge subsequent to the projects&rsquo; activities. As part of its core mission, the Center should support research, evaluation, and dissemination activities. A national advisory panel should be formed to help guide this work.</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p>Evaluation/Data Collection Support. The NSFAYS Center is expected to
        provide information and data on the degree to which the NSFAYS program
        is meeting its goals: (1) to determine to what extent students learn
        more as a result of the interventions and (2) to measure increased interest
        and persistence in STEM learning. The Center should collect information
        and data from each project on the model it is developing and the effectiveness
        of its various elements. To this end, it is expected that the Center
        will provide technical support on evaluation, research, and data collection
        for the NSFAYS Projects. Its activities may include, but are not limited
        to, organizing and holding meetings and identifying resources (including
        print and electronic) and professionals in the field that may augment
        or enhance projects in meeting their goals. During the third year of
        the program, the Center should plan and organize a summit that would
        bring the project staffs and program stakeholders together to share and
        formalize findings and models. In addition, the NSFAYS Center is expected
        to support discussions, provide supporting materials to projects, and
        disseminate ideas and materials from the projects and the program to
        the field.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Research and Evaluation. As part of the proposal, the NSFAYS
            Center must develop a conceptual framework for the research and evaluation
            of the program. This includes explicating the theories on which the
        program is built, providing the relevant reviews of the literature, and
        presenting a clear statement of the questions that drive the data collection
        and analysis. Although each project will have its own individual evaluation
            and research plans, the project goals will be closely aligned with
        the program goals. Consequently, it is anticipated that the project data
            and findings will be integral to the work of the NSFAYS Center. Projects
            will be required, as a condition of their award, to cooperate with
        the NSFAYS Center. As part of the proposal, the PI should explain how
        the Center proposes to work with NSFAYS Projects to gather data and findings
            while minimizing intrusions by the Center into the work of the projects.
            It might be appropriate for the Center to raise additional research
        questions. If so, these should be tied to the goals of the program.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Work Plan</strong></p>
<p>Each project should present an action plan with a timeline that clearly addresses the center goals and objectives and organizes the major activities of the center.</p>
<p><strong>4. Key Personnel</strong></p>
<p>The proposal should list the key personnel as well as their roles and responsibilities in the Center. Include all individuals that bring the requisite expertise needed to execute Center responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>5. Dissemination</strong></p>
<p>The NSFAYS Center is expected to have major responsibility for the dissemination of project findings to the field and the general public. In addition to submitting a comprehensive report to NSF, the Center should include a plan for disseminating findings to both the formal and informal STEM education communities and other professionals and stakeholders as deemed appropriate. This should include but not be limited to publication of articles, reports and a monograph, conference presentations, and an exposition of project outcomes.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Illustrative Examples of Available K-8 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Materials</strong></p>
<p><strong>Astronomy Resources for Intercurricular Elementary Science (ARIES)</strong>. Project ARIES brings the excitement of hands-on discovery to elementary and middle school students, using astronomy as the central focus for physical science. Students use innovative, simple, and affordable materials to carry out a range of indoor and outdoor discovery-based activities. Each of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/sed/arieslevel2.html">eight self-contained modules</a> encourages students to learn and master a limited number of powerful physical science concepts. ARIES modules are available from <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.charlesbridge.com">Charlesbridge Publishing Company</a>.

<p><strong>Classroom FeederWatch (CFW)</strong>. CFW is a research and interdisciplinary curriculum, grades 5-8, developed by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. By teaching students how science and scientists work, it helps them become scientists themselves. Information collected for this project is used by ornithologists to track annual changes in the abundance and distribution of bird species that use feeders in winter. In addition, the project gives teachers a chance to integrate science with language arts, visual arts, social studies, mathematics, and technology. Students are encouraged to submit materials and publish their findings materials in a newsletter, as well as describe their thoughts about the project.

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.

<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
    (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
    of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
    criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
    and activities.
</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
      How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
        teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity
        broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity,
        disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure
        for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks,
        and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance
        scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits
        of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote><p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
      One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.    </p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
          women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
          -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
          NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to
          the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
          </p>
  </p>

</ul>
<h4><strong>B. Review and Selection Process</strong>
</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span class="input">Panel Review</span>.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
</p>

<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)</p></p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>
<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm</a>.

      across projects (see Section II.B.).</span>
    </p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
</p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
