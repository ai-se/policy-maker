        <h3> I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>The ERC Program was started in 1985, when the White House and National Academy of Engineering requested a program to: (1) develop a new interdisciplinary culture in engineering research and education in partnership with industry to strengthen the competitiveness of the U.S. and (2) educate new generations of engineers who would be capable of integrating fundamental knowledge across disciplines to advance systems-level technology. To date, eighty-five percent of ERCs are self-sustaining after expiration of ERC Program support. </p>
        <p>The ERC model rests on the systems-driven ERC research culture that integrates research and education and incorporates academic and industrial perspectives. In addition, the model enhances this platform through increased emphasis on translational research. Objectives of ERCs are to strategically integrate research, workforce development, and innovation; accelerate the use of ERC-generated technology; add educational experiences in entrepreneurial training, innovation, and creativity; build long-term pre-college partnerships to attract more students to engineering; and encourage foreign collaborations to give ERC students the opportunity to experience a foreign laboratory research culture.</p>
        <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p><strong>A. Goal and Key Features of ERCs</strong></p>
        <p>The goal of the ERC Program is to integrate engineering research and education with technological innovation to transform national prosperity, health, and security. It links scientific discovery to technological innovation and supports engineering graduates who can be leaders in industrial practice and creative pioneers in a global economy. The ERCs awarded through this solicitation shall have an infrastructure that integrates and implements the key features (research, workforce development, and innovation ecosystem development) to address the following gaps/barriers:</p>
       <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Research</em></strong>
            <ul>
              <li>To conduct an interdisciplinary research program that aligns systems-motivated fundamental and applied research with enabling and systems technologies to demonstrate proofs-of-principle of the engineered systems developed in test beds</li>
              <li>To translate interdisciplinary advances from research in fundamental knowledge, enabling technology, and transformational engineered systems to innovation</li>

          <p><strong>B. Guidance Regarding ERC Key Features</strong></p>
          <p>The ERC Program expects each proposing team to propose innovative modes that integrate best practices from successful Gen-2 and Gen-3 ERCs to effectively realize the ERC Program's goal. For more information, see the list of Centers at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.erc-assoc.org/Centers">http://www.erc-assoc.org/Centers</a>. Follow the links to each ERC's page. See also: the "Best Practices Manual" that was developed and updated by faculty, staff and students from ERCs (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://erc-assoc.org/best_practices/best-practices-manual">http://erc-assoc.org/best_practices/best-practices-manual</a>).</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Research  ; ;</strong></li>
          <p>Advances in fundamental knowledge and development of enabling technology in an ERC shall be guided and motivated by goals of the engineered systems vision and its anticipated challenges and outcomes. An ERC cultivates interdisciplinary interactions among teams of partner university faculty and students and industry researchers at fundamental, technological, and test-bed levels. This merges the culture of fundamental research in academe with the systems culture of industry to prepare tomorrow's leaders in research and innovation. Participating researchers and institutions interact adaptively to deliver near-term results and outcomes to meet impending needs of industry and/or society, as well as longer-term advances in fundamental knowledge and technology that support progress toward demonstration of proof-of-concepts of the ERC vision in engineered system test beds.</p>
          <p><strong>1.a. General Vision Guidance</strong>: The ten-year vision should drive advances in an emerging and potentially transformative engineered system(s) that has potential to significantly impact the selected research area, establish new industries, or transform public sector services or infrastructure. Realization of the systems vision will overcome gaps and barriers identified in existing engineering practice and lead to increased national economic competitiveness or contributes to the solution of a major societal problem that has national, and possibly international, impact. The vision must incorporate emerging discoveries in science and engineering and must be expansive in scope to include innovation goals. If relevant to the technology proposed, there must be awareness of and compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations.</p>
          <p><em><strong>What is an engineered system?</strong></em></p>
          <p>An engineered system is a combination of components/elements coordinated to work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function. The engineered system can be, for example, a new technology for a new product line or civil infrastructure system. It could lead to new manufacturing processes. It can transform public sector services or infrastructure systems. Part of the complexity of engineered systems research derives from integrating factors that enable their use in products, services, or infrastructures - factoring in their impacts on manufacturing efficiency, service delivery efficiency, resilience of civil infrastructures, the environment, society, or the human body, as appropriate to the system chosen. While fundamental, high-risk/high-reward research on one or more of the enabling components/elements may be required to realize the functionality of the system; focusing on the individual components/elements without their integration into an engineered system is not appropriate for an ERC.</p>
          <p><strong>1.b. Vision Topic Area</strong>: Up to four awards will be funded in the following proposal submission areas, and there is no preference for the number of awards in each area.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Open Topic ERCs</em></strong>: There is no preference for engineered systems topics. The topic must integrate fundamental science and engineering discovery with technological innovation to transform national prosperity, health, and/or security using an engineered systems approach. The topic must not overlap significantly with an existing ERC, graduated ERC, or other federally funded center or institute.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Nanosystem ERCs</em></strong>: A Nanosystem Engineering Research Center (NERC) must be focused on a transformational engineered system(s) that could not be achieved without a significant level of fundamental knowledge of nanoscale phenomena that feeds into devices and components needed to realize the targeted engineered system(s). A NERC must build on a significant fundamental discovery or engineering breakthrough in nanotechnology and/or nanomanufacturing research that is ready to feed into proof-of-concept engineered system test beds within the 10-year life span of an ERC.</p>
          <p>The NERCs will be a part of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI); information about the NNI is available on the NSF web site: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nano">https://www.nsf.gov/nano</a>. The NNI is a government-wide activity designed to ensure that investments in this area are made in a coordinated and timely manner and to accelerate the pace of revolutionary nanotechnology discoveries. In a recent review of the NNI, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) called for government agencies, industry, and the research community to identify and pursue nanotechnology Grand Challenges. For more information, please refer to: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_fifth_nni_review_oct2014_final.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_fifth_nni_review_oct2014_final.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>NOTE: The same (or similar) proposal can NOT be submitted in more than one track, even if the research program is changed to increase or decrease the emphasis on a given area.</p>
          <p><strong>1.c. Value Added of the Proposed Vision</strong>: The vision for the Center must meet the following criteria:</p>
          <p><strong><em>Transformative</em></strong>: The vision should address a challenge of national significance by integrating fundamental research and enabling technology at the frontier in a compelling way. The vision could not be achieved without a significant level of fundamental knowledge that feeds into devices, components/elements, and/or processes supporting the system(s). Incremental improvements that hold little potential to provide clear improvements over the state-of-the-art will not be supported. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Unique</strong></em>: The vision must be novel with significant added value relative to the plans and achievements of NSF- or other agency-funded center(s) that are active or have ended. The added value over state-of-the-art activities, alternative research approaches, and similar or related collaborative activities in major projects, centers, or institutes currently funded or called for by NSF or by other federal agencies must be specifically discussed. The vision of proposing team(s) whose personnel derive largely from a previous or existing center must provide a clear rationale for its novelty and value added to warrant an additional NSF investment. Proposals with significant overlap or duplication or lack of justification relative to existing activity or requests are not supportable as an ERC.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Convergent</strong></em>: Envisioned proofs-of-principle that systematically guide ERC activities to achieve the vision in proposed Center testbeds through integration of emerging fundamental research and enabling technologies within the ten-year period of NSF funding. Integration of envisioned activities must show compelling promise in overcoming well-defined, critical gaps and barriers in existing understanding and yield outcomes that meet industry/practitioner needs in the short- and medium-term. Basic research activities without clearly presented strategies to advance enabling and systems technologies and proofs of concept will not be supported.</p>
          <p>Descriptions of Ongoing ERCs and other NSF Funded Centers: Access to the web sites for ongoing ERCs can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.erc-assoc.org/Centers">http://www.erc-assoc.org/Centers</a>.

          <p><strong>1.d. Research Strategic Plan</strong>: An ERC must have a strategic research plan motivated by the engineered systems vision and positioned to advance the state of the art in research, technology, and innovation. The plan must be aligned with strategic plans for workforce (education) development, innovation ecosystem, and inclusion. Elements critical for the strategic plan include:</p>
          <p><em><strong>Context</strong></em>: Relevant state of the art research and practice must be summarized. Key gaps in knowledge and technology and technical, societal, and regulatory barriers to achieving the proposed vision should be identified. Proposed activities that leverage available knowledge and technologies outside the ERC should be included to complement Center capabilities, accelerate progress, and avoid duplication.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Critical path</em></strong>: Fundamental insights that enable the ERC to achieve its vision must be elucidated. Clearly-defined research and development activities to fill specific gaps and bridge specified barriers must be articulated. Research thrusts must link advances in knowledge with development of enabling technologies to support exploration, testing, and demonstration(s) of envisioned systems in the testbeds. Metrics that benchmark milestones for critical-path activities must be specific, measurable, attainable, and relevant to Center vision. Milestones must integrate advances in research thrust activities and mark timely progress toward demonstrating proof of principle of the Center vision within 10 years and beyond.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Resources</strong></em>: Personnel, equipment, facilities, and capital requirements to support activities at fundamental, technological, and system testbed levels must be defined and justified. Management of Center intellectual property (IP) across lead and partner institutions to enable domain licensing and its translation to societal use must be addressed. The ERC team shall include faculty, students, and staff who come from different disciplines and perspectives on research, education, technological innovation, and administration and who also bring the rich perspectives offered by diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, and other aspects. Institutional support must be evident.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Adaptive</strong></em>: The strategic plan must evolve to keep activities, metrics, milestones, personnel, frameworks, and resources (Center components) at the forefront of the sector defined in the Center's vision. A maturing ERC must refine its vision to focus on core advances, prunes less compelling Center components, and increase the level of detail and complexity of its strategic plan. Center leadership must actively involve advisory boards in regular evaluation of progress of teams and activities, in annual competitive project selection, and in implementation of ERC advances. Contingency plans shall be supported by intermediate go/no-go decision points to terminate projects, activities, thrusts, and testbeds as required to achieve Center vision. Plans to evolve leadership, participating faculty, and IP management as activities are sunset and progress is benchmarked need to be supported collectively by ERC personnel and advisory boards.</p>
          <p><strong>1.e. Research Activities</strong>: ERC research activities that address gaps and barriers to advance fundamental knowledge and enabling technologies must be organized into coordinated thrusts and testbeds to achieve milestones, intermediate deliverables, and long-term objectives of the Center's envisioned engineered system(s). Attributes critical to defined research activities include:</p>
          <p><em><strong>Synergy</strong></em>: ERC projects, activities, and thrusts must be pursued by faculty and students who are integrated into highly collaborative, actively networked teams. ERC teams shall have the interdisciplinary composition, expertise, and networks required to address gaps as well as technical, societal, pedagogical, institutional, and regulatory barriers to progress. Synthesis of disciplinary perspectives, technologies, and terminologies from respective team members in the ERC shall challenge conventional approaches and accelerate progress in addressing gaps and barriers to achieve project milestones. Individual projects and activities must be interdependent with outcomes integrated to advance synergistically. A collection of projects or thrusts at geographically separate institutions that has little integration or which provides little added value beyond the sum of the parts is not supportable as an ERC. Faculty who advocate individual research interests that are misaligned with Center's strategic plan are not supportable in an ERC.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Partnership</strong></em>: ERC teams synthesize their disciplinary perspectives, technologies, and terminologies with those of participants from partnering and affiliated institutions through mentoring, shared advising, and mutually-beneficial, co-adaptive interactions using frameworks that are sustainable during and after 10 years of NSF funding. Industrial, academic, and institutional partners, advisory boards, and networks provide access to leverage existing or imminently available knowledge and technologies that complement Center capabilities. Faculty who advocate individual research interests in competition with achieving progress in the Center's strategic plan are not supportable in an ERC. Providing resources to participating faculty out of alignment with the strategic plan is not supportable in an ERC. </p>
          <p><em><strong>System at scale</strong></em>: Projects and activities are characterized and undertaken in sufficient depth in the respective constituent disciplines to support major advances in fundamental knowledge and enabling technologies. Exploration, testing, and demonstration of integrated knowledge and technology in engineered systems at the testbed scale goes beyond the typical bench or laboratory scale in terms of viability and complexity. But testbed demonstration of ERC vision does not attain industrial product and process realization stages. These are expected to be supported by industry/practitioner partners who license and/or implement the technology. Testbeds illustrate proof of concept at sufficient scale and complexity to accelerate technology transfer directly into the industry sector defined by the ERC. They may generate new directions at fundamental and technological levels, such as when system level barriers are not realistically surmountable. Centers that lack transformative advances at knowledge and technology levels and/or demonstration of engineered systems-level proof of principle within a 10-year funded period are not supportable as an ERC.</p>
          <p>Note: NSF funds may not be used to support clinical trials. If the research involves vertebrate animals, an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval for vertebrate animal research must be included in the proposal. If the research includes human subjects, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval must be included in the invited full proposal as well.</p>
          <li><strong>Engineering Workforce Development</strong></li>
          <p>ERCs produce graduates who will be U.S. innovators in a globally competitive economy through an Engineering Workforce Development (Education) program. This program encompasses graduate research, education, and professional formation; undergraduate classroom and research experiences; and outreach to attract pre-college and nontraditional students, particularly those from backgrounds underrepresented in engineering. </p>
          <p><strong>2.a. University Education Program</strong>: Students in an ERC attain disciplinary depth, broad professional skills, and systems expertise by participating in curriculum and training in an ERC education program. The program must include these key components:</p>
          <p><em><strong>Education Strategic plan</strong></em>: An ERC strategic education plan aligned with its plans for research, innovation, and inclusion must demonstrate commitment and resources to carry out efforts to achieve its goals. The goals of the plan shall be to deliver graduates prepared for industry and academia who are technically prepared; able to integrate knowledge across disciplines to advance technology; knowledgeable in industrial practice; experienced in advancing technology; adept at working in highly functional teams; ethical; effective communicators; creative, innovative, and entrepreneurial; lifelong learners; and experienced in working in non-U.S. research cultures. The plan must coordinate student activities and interactions with partners and advisory boards, particularly the Workforce Development Advisory Board, to attract, retain, progress, and graduate ERC students. Particular attention must be paid to broadening participation from populations underrepresented in engineering to cultivate a climate of inclusion with diverse representation.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Curricular impact</strong></em>: The ERC university education program must be carried out in collaboration with the ongoing education programs of the domestic partner universities. It is structured to involve ERC engineering and associated discipline students at B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels at each partner institution. Undergraduate ERC students must participate in significant research experiences during the academic year. Graduate and undergraduate students engaged in research during the academic year should be at a ratio of two graduate students to one undergraduate student. At least 6 non-ERC students must enroll in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program budgeted at minimum $42K per year from the ERC base budget. This may be augmented from other sources. Each ERC will identify the impact on the curricula at lead and partner universities from integration of Center research. Examples include new courses, course modules/content for insertion in existing courses, and/or new certificate and degree programs. Coordination of university education programs with local community colleges and/or technical colleges is encouraged to strengthen pathways between 2- and 4-year institutions, as is inclusion of veterans as participants in ERC research and education programs.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Skill sets</strong></em>: Key technical, professional, and transferable professional skills that undergraduate and graduate students shall possess upon graduation to achieve the strategic plan goals must be determined. Research-based pedagogical and experiential approaches to impart these skill sets must be identified. This includes curriculum, research training, advising, mentoring, internships and other ERC student experiences that assure these desired skill sets are acquired. There should be actionable plans to effectively mentor students in research and attend to their professional formation as researchers and engineers.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Global exchange</strong></em>: The ERC program must integrate education and training across the core and partner institutions using course cross-listings, cyberinfrastructure, internet modules, lab exchanges, and other support structures. ERC students should have opportunities to conduct ERC-relevant research in labs of foreign collaborators for a time sufficient to build global networks and provide knowledge of global research practices, capacities, and other competencies.</p>
          <p><strong>2.b. Pre-college Education Program</strong>: Each ERC workforce (education) development program must include a pre-college education program designed to build engineering workforce capacity by stimulating student interest in engineering careers and increasing the diversity of students studying engineering at the college level. Attributes critical to pre-college education must include:</p>
          <p><em><strong>Engagement</strong></em>: ERCs shall integrate best practices and effective ongoing efforts to (1) enhance student learning of engineering concepts derived from the ERC; (2) increase student interest and engagement in engineering; and (3) support teacher professional development that translates to sustained teaching of engineering at the pre-college level. Pre-college students excited by engineering and technological innovation through innovative methods such as inquiry based learning are motivated to pursue engineering degree programs in community colleges, colleges, and universities. The ERC should ensure its faculty and students participate in the full scope of the pre-college education program and their home institutions recognize and reward their efforts.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Partnership</strong></em>: To achieve its pre-college goals, lead and partner universities of the ERC must form effective long-term partnerships with up to five pre-college institutions (e.g., school districts, individual schools, ongoing programs) that leverage participating industry partners, state and local funding sources, and existing evidence- based P-12 programs. Partner institutions must agree to work with the Center to (1) allow their STEM teachers to participate in structured ERC research and education programs; (2) provide engineering learning and activity experiences for their students; (3) integrate new course modules based on ERC research into their curriculum; (4) develop strategies to embrace underrepresented groups, both teachers and students, into these engineering experiences; (5) enable talented high school students to pursue research experiences in the ERC's laboratories. One partnership must consist of an RET program that (a) provides in-service and/or pre-service to K-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty (if included) with engineering research experiences in ERC research labs/facilities; (b) results in increased knowledge of engineering for the teachers, strong engineering content modules for the classroom derived from ERC research, and effective engineering experiences for students; and (c) includes substantive plans for sustained follow-up between faculty and pre-college teachers and any community/technical college faculty to ensure research experiences are translated into classroom practice.</p>
          <p><strong>2.c. Assessment</strong>: The ERC must have program of formative and summative assessment that monitors progress and achievement of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely) goals of the strategic plan within the Center lifetime at university and pre-college levels. Assessment shall be conducted by a qualified group outside the ERC. Measures to assess progress and impacts through longitudinal data shall be identified. Mechanisms to incorporate feedback from assessment and the Workforce Development Advisory Board to improve the workforce development program content and delivery must be outlined. Note: Due to the nature of these activities, an Institutional Review Board approval for research involving human subjects must be included in the full proposal.</p>
          <li><strong>Innovation Ecosystem Development</strong></li>
          <p>An ERC must cultivate a vibrant innovation ecosystem that coordinates transformative engineering with innovation for large scale impact on a targeted sector of the national economy. This ecosystem shall have the following key components:</p>
          <p><strong>3.a. Strategic plan</strong>: The ERC must have a strategic plan for an innovation ecosystem that positions it for disruptive impact in a sector of the U.S. economy critical to its future interests. This plan shall analyze influential industry, regulatory, and nonprofit stakeholders in the sector to reveal critical existing gaps in capabilities as well as technical, societal, and regulatory barriers to the envisioned disruption. It shall also identify tangible benchmarks with which to evaluate milestones in Center progress toward bridging these gaps and barriers. Market and societal aspects of the Center beyond control of ERC participants (i.e., the chosen market Sector) shall be identified, including rules, societal norms, practices, regulations or policies that govern decision-making and that could help or hinder adoption of ERC technology. This is especially important when the ERC is intended to benefit the public good.</p>
          <p>Strategic innovation plans must align with strategies in research and workforce development to form and cultivate an alliance of key stakeholders necessary to drive innovation, build the economy, and assure U.S. competitiveness in the sector. This includes actionable plans to recruit, engage, and retain stakeholders as partners. It also includes frameworks and infrastructure to translate foundational knowledge and enabling technologies developed in the ERC to the targeted applications.</p>
          <p><strong>3.b. Stakeholder community</strong>: The stakeholder community participating in an ERC innovation ecosystem consists of the core university partners, university affiliates, industry partners, government /non-profit practitioners (e.g., hospitals), civil society (e.g. state and local governments), associations (industry, professional, non-profit, or public), and end users that synergistically implement the ERC vision to achieve disruptive, large-scale impact. The ERC must define the expected value-added and/or role each stakeholder will contribute to the development and sustenance of the proposed Center's innovation ecosystem. </p>
          <p><em><strong>(3.b.1) Industrial/Practitioner Advisory Board (IPAB)</strong></em>: The IPAB must be a fee-based membership program. Participating industry / practitioner members must contribute financial and in-kind support to the Center. Regular guidance from IPAB members must be coordinated with ERC leadership decisions on strategic planning, research directions, workforce development, and the role of innovation within the Center. This guidance is key to industrial/practitioner pre-competitive collaborative research with the Center. IPAB members are expected to:</p>
        
           
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Participate in the ERC;</li>
                <li>Provide knowledge of fundamental research gaps, manufacturing, product design, validation, regulatory approval, economic evaluation, and/or the practices involved in transfer of knowledge/technology and delivery of service, as appropriate to the vision;</li>
                <li>Contribute to workforce development programs by providing guidance on the desired skill sets needed for success in industry and innovation; </li>
                <li>Participate as mentors to ERC undergraduate and graduate students and host industrial internships for ERC students; and </li>
                <li>Assist in establishing the cultures of innovation and inclusion required for the ERC's students, faculty, and staff.</li>
            
         
          </ul>
          <p>IPAB membership must be strategically designed to include key firms in the value chain relevant to the ERC's vision in order to promote innovation and accelerate commercialization. Active engagement of member firms / practitioner organizations through the research program, student internships, and the employment of ERC graduates in industry and other practitioner organizations will be the primary mechanisms to accelerate transfer of ERC research to industry and other users.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(3.b.2) University, State and Local Government Facilitators of Entrepreneurship and Innovation</strong></em>: In addition to the IPAB, the ERC innovation ecosystem must include formal partnerships with university and/or state and local government organizations and/or programs devoted to facilitating entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic development at local and regional levels (e.g., I-Corps site/node, I/UCRC, etc.). These partnerships should leverage Center research to stimulate innovation, promote entrepreneurship, and impact local economic development and job creation. Partners should be involved with the ERC's workforce development programs to bring awareness and knowledge of entrepreneurship and innovation to the ERC's students and faculty. These partners are not member firms/practitioner partners in the IPAB; they do not pay annual membership fees to the Center.</p>
          <p><strong>3.c. Innovation frameworks</strong>: The ERC must define the rules of interaction and operation within the ERC ecosystem. This includes detailing the levels of IPAB membership and their corresponding requirements and privileges; defining management and translation of intellectual property developed in and between participating ERC institutions; and establishing a systematic process to identify, document, and manage conflicts of interests that may arise between ERC team members and members of the stakeholder community. Certification must be provided from an appropriate university official that conflicts of interest will be managed by the university or, if unmanageable, reported to NSF. These frameworks must be consistent with the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide and the CA-FATC.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(3.c.1) IPAB Membership Agreement</strong></em>: Participation in an ERC IPAB must be governed by a Center-wide Membership Agreement that details the tiered membership levels for IPAB participation with corresponding annual fee schedule, rights, duties, and opportunities and policies for management and translation of intellectual property. Guidance on effective agreements and IP policies is available in the Innovation Ecosystem chapter of the ERC Best Practices Manual, which can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://erc-assoc.org/best_practices/chapter-3-research-management">
http://erc-assoc.org/best_practices/chapter-3-research-management</a>.</p>
      
          
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>The Membership Agreement must include a scaled fee structure for member firms/agencies/hospitals that recognizes the differing capacity for participation according to their size.</li>
                <li>Industry commitments must start with cash membership fees. These may be augmented by in-kind contributions according to the size of the firm and the terms of the agreement.</li>
                <li>Agency/hospital (practitioner) member fees may be cash or in-kind.</li>
                <li>All members may contribute augmented support through sponsored research projects.</li>
                <li>There may be firms that provide support for sponsored research projects but do not pay membership fees to join the Center. These firms are not considered IPAB members.</li>
                <li>Proposals must demonstrate financial commitment by industry / practitioner members; however, there is no required formula in relation to NSF support.</li>
                <li>Fee-paying IPAB members have first option to license ERC-generated IP under the terms of the agreement.</li>
           
           
          </ul>
          <p ><em><strong>(3.c.2) Technology Transfer and Translational Research Partnerships</strong></em>: Technology transfer to the IPAB member firms/practitioner partners will be the primary means of commercialization of ERC research. In the event that ERC member firms / practitioners do not exercise the option to license promising ERC-generated IP, the Center may choose to pursue a variety of partnerships to license the IP. These may include large and/or small companies who are committed to bring the IP to market. In addition, the ERC may pursue translational research partnerships with small-business member or non-member firms.</p></ol>
          <p><strong>C. ERC Infrastructure</strong></p>
          <p>Infrastructure required to support participating domestic university partners and affiliates and foreign collaborators in an ERC includes a strong leadership team; advisory boards; a culture of inclusion; well-coordinated management systems; facilities, equipment, and headquarter space; and institutional commitment.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Configuration
            
          </strong></li>
         
          <p><strong>1.a. Domestic Partner Universities</strong>: The domestic partner universities must include the lead university and at least one, but no more than four, additional domestic partner universities as defined in the "Eligibility, Organization Limit" &sect;IV. This does not imply that the proposal must include five partners; however, a configuration of one lead and no partner universities is not acceptable. Each partner institution must have a minimum of three ERC faculty and a total of at least three students. Each partner is expected to be an active participant in all features of the ERC.</p>
      
          <p>The lead or at least one of the domestic partners must be a university that serves large numbers of underrepresented minority students who are majoring in engineering fields AND are from collective groups underrepresented in engineering in the U.S. (i.e. African Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and persons with disabilities who are U.S. citizens or Permanent Residents). A university may qualify as an ERC underrepresented minority -serving partner if there is a significant combined percentage of these underrepresented groups engaged in Engineering studies, but the percentage is less than required by the Department of Education's official classifications of universities with significant populations of underrepresented minority groups. In such a case, the proposal must justify the selection with data, including a demonstrated graduation track record. Consequently, this approach expands the set of universities eligible to be an ERC partner university. The Department of Education's official classifications of universities with significant populations of underrepresented groups can be found at: <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/OCR/elite-minorityinst.html">http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/OCR/elite-minorityinst.html</a>. The lead and each of the partner universities must be committed to an integrated configuration to fulfill the research, workforce (education) development, innovation, and inclusion goals of the ERC.</p>
          
         <p><strong>1.b. Affiliated Domestic Institutions (Not Required)</strong>: These institutions are not considered partners and are not required to cost share. While not a required feature, strategic insertion of faculty/staff from non- partner affiliated institutions into research, workforce (education) development, and innovation aspects of the ERC may provide technical expertise on a temporary basis as the Center evolves. These institutions may be universities, colleges, federal laboratories, funded centers with whom synergies arise, and/or institutes for innovation, manufacturing, education, etc. The number of faculty/staff in this category should be kept to a level that minimizes additional management complexity while infusing the ERC with complementary state-of-the art expertise needed to achieve overall objectives. Contributions of participants from affiliated institutions may be in research, workforce development, and/or innovation. These individuals are not required to have a long-term commitment to the ERC. NSF funds cannot be used to support staff from federal laboratories who ;participate in an ERC.</p>
    
          <p><strong>1.c. Foreign Collaborations (Required)</strong>: The ERC shall provide opportunities for domestic students and faculty to collaborate in a globally connected university research and education environment. These collaborations are not expected to be in place in the proposal; rather collaborations between ERC faculty and faculty in foreign universities that include student involvement in research are expected to evolve over time as the research program evolves. Collaborations may be with researchers in foreign institutes to engage in pre-competitive research, as opposed to new product development. There is no required number of these partnerships, but the number of collaborations must be manageable.</p>
      
          <p>International partnerships may be formally established between the ERC and a foreign university through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) managed consistent with Financial &amp; Administrative Terms and Conditions (FATC), for example, or they may be less formal ERC faculty-to-foreign faculty collaborations. In either case, the foreign collaboration must add value to the research and offer ERC students opportunities to work in a foreign laboratory for a period of time sufficient to gain meaningful international research experience that is relevant to the student's research in the ERC. In both cases, there should be mutually protective Intellectual Property (IP) policies with advance written approval from center advisory boards.</p>
         
          <p>NSF funds may be used to support ERC faculty and students in these collaborations at both the U.S. and foreign sites of the collaboration. NSF funds may be used to support the time that international collaborators carry out research and/or educational activities at the ERC's sites in the U.S.; otherwise, support for collaborative activities at foreign collaborator institutions must be obtained from their respective funding organizations.</div>
        
       <p><strong>1.d. Other Required Partnerships</strong>: The ERC shall partner with pre-college educational institutions to bring engineering concepts to the classroom and stimulate student interest enrolling in college-level engineering degree programs and in engineering careers. In addition, there may be partnerships with community and/or technical colleges to strengthen the technical workforce and stimulate interest in careers in engineering.</p>
         
          <li><strong>Leadership, Culture, Organization, Facilities and Commitment</strong></li>
       
   
            <p><strong>2.a. Leadership Team</strong>: Each ERC shall have the following leadership team comprised of members who are diverse in gender, race and ethnicity (from groups underrepresented in engineering) and persons with disabilities. Except for the Administrative Director, the Industrial Collaboration and Innovation Director, and the leaders of the Student Leadership Council, who may be designated after notification of the award, the leadership team must be specified in the full proposal. Among the leadership team (i.e., the PI and co-PIs as well as the below designated leaders) there must be identified individuals with deep expertise in fundamental science/engineering areas envisioned by the ERC; strategic leadership in innovation including intellectual property; and workforce development that includes creating a culture of inclusion, graduate education, and broadening participation. Funds budgeted to support leadership roles are one indication of commitment. Changes after proposal submission are subject to advance approval in writing by the site visit team and ERC program management, in accordance with a succession plan that names replacements for each leadership team member in the event of departure, and is maintained in the Center.</p>
          
           <p><em><strong>(2.a.1.) Center Director</strong>:</em> In compliance with the PI eligibility criteria, the Center Director must be a tenured engineering faculty member and the Lead NSF Principal Investigator (PI) who is responsible for leading the ERC and administering the award in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Cooperative Agreement issued by the NSF in the event of an award.</p>
         
            <p><em><strong>(2.a.2.) Deputy Director/Executive Manager</strong>:</em> The Center may have a Deputy Director who is a faculty member and shares the leadership and management responsibilities of the Center with the Director. If there is no faculty member suitable for this role, the Center may propose to include an Executive Manager instead of the Deputy Director, who will be a staff member dedicated to working with the Director in executing the mission of the Center.</p>
        
           <p><em><strong>(2.a.3.) Research Thrust Leaders</strong>:</em> Faculty members from across the domestic partner universities who are responsible for leading and managing major research thrusts and test beds of the ERC.</p>
      
         <p><em><strong>(2.a.4.) Workforce Development Program Director</strong>:</em> A faculty member who is responsible for the development and execution of the ERC's university education program and supported by other faculty, students, and staff in the execution of the ERC's efforts.</p>
      
          <p><em><strong>(2.a.5) Industrial Liaison Officer</strong>:</em> A staff member, not faculty, at the lead university who is responsible for developing the ERC's innovation ecosystem, marketing the ERC to industry / practitioners, gaining their financial support, developing and coordinating industrial / practitioner involvement with faculty and students, and managing the other partnerships for innovation and the translational research program.</p>
   
         <p><em><strong>(2.a.6) Diversity Director</strong>:</em> A staff or faculty member who is experienced in the development, implementation, and assessment of proven activities that can create a culture of inclusion and recruit/retain underrepresented groups in engineering or STEM fields. </p>

        <p><em><strong>(2.a.7) Administrative Director</strong>:</em> A staff member at the lead university who is responsible for operational management, financial management, data collection, publicity, and reporting, etc. for the ERC.</p>
       
            <p><em><strong>(2.a.8) Student Leadership Council (SLC)</strong>:</em> Undergraduate and graduate students from all the partner universities responsible for coordinating their various activities in support of the ERC research, education, and innovation agenda. A student President and a student co-President lead the SLC. The SLC will prepare a written Strengths- Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis and present the SWOT during the annual visit of the NSF site visit team (SVT).</p>
          
            <p><strong>2.b. Advisory Boards</strong>: Each ERC shall receive and incorporate regular guidance from external and internal advisory boards and councils.</p>
            
           <p><em><strong>(2.b.1.) Scientific Advisory Board</strong>:</em> The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) will be comprised of outside experts who are selected by the ERC Leadership Team. The SAB must meet as a group with the Center at least once a year and once each year with the NSF SVT at the annual site visit. (Note: Do not contact potential members or appoint this advisory board during the proposal preparation and review process or list potential members in the participant table.)</p>

            <p><em><strong>(2.b.2.) Industrial/Practitioner Advisory Board</strong>:</em> The Industrial/Practitioner Advisory Board (IPAB) will be comprised of representatives of member companies/agencies/hospitals. The IPAB shall meet collectively as a group twice each year to advise the ERC's leadership team; to prepare a written Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis; and to present the SWOT in an annual meeting with the NSF SVT. The IPAB will have a chair who organizes the board's activities in coordination with the Industrial Liaison Officer and the Center Director. The IPAB must participate in the ERC's annual project selection/review process by providing input on project quality and industrial relevance.</p>
          
          <p><em><strong>(2.b.3.) Academic Policy Board</strong>:</em> Administrators from the lead university, including the Dean of Engineering, will meet collectively as a group with the ERC Director to coordinate ERC plans and policies with departmental and university leaders.</p>

            <p><em><strong>(2.b.4.) Council of Deans:</strong></em> Led by the Dean of Engineering from the lead university, this Council of Deans from the lead and partner academic institutions meets collectively as a group to provide administrative support of the ERC and to help facilitate the ERC's research, education, and innovation efforts across the lead and partner universities.</p>
      
            <p><em><strong>(2.b.5.) Workforce Development Advisory Board (WDAB)</strong>:</em> The WDAB will be comprised of experts in workforce development (education) and broadening participation selected by the ERC Leadership Team from outside the core and partner institutions and other advisory boards. They may represent activities funded by NSF (e.g., NSF Research Traineeships) or other federal agencies or public, non-profit, or private groups. The WDAB will meet as a group at least once a year with the Center and once each year with the NSF SVT. (Note: Do not contact potential members or appoint this advisory board during the proposal preparation and review process or list potential members in the participant table.)</p>
      
            <p><strong>2.c. Culture of Inclusion</strong>: ERCs must promote a culture of inclusion where faculty, students, and staff from all backgrounds have an opportunity to succeed in research, education, innovation, and administration. Thus, the leadership team, faculty, students, and staff involved in an ERC, as well as the above specified advisory boards and councils, must be diverse in their experiences as well as diverse in gender, race, and ethnicity - i.e., women, African Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic Americans, veterans, or persons with disabilities who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The ERC must also be made multicultural through the involvement of faculty and students from other countries by virtue of their role as faculty or students in the Center's domestic institutions.</p>
           
          <p><em><strong>Vision</strong>:</em> The ERC will articulate a vision to achieve broadening participation of groups underrepresented in engineering that exceeds the academic engineering-wide national averages and continues through time on an upward slope in relationship to those national averages. This diversity must be present among participants from the lead and each of the partner academic institutions. While at least one of the partner institutions must serve large numbers of students majoring in STEM fields who are from groups underrepresented in engineering, that institution cannot be the predominant contributor to the diversity of the ERC. The ERC will partner with pre-college institutions that have diverse student bodies, as discussed above. Note: proposals cannot include numerical projections. Collaborating foreign faculty are expected to respect the diversity of the ERC's faculty and students and provide inclusive research and education environments. The multicultural nature of ERCs mandates that the language of discourse in ERC laboratories will be English to maintain an inclusive environment for all.</p>
      
           <p><em><strong>Strategic plan</strong>:</em> The ERC workforce development (education) strategic plan must include plans to cultivate a culture of inclusivity that integrates faculty, students and staff who come from different disciplines and perspectives on research, education, and technological innovation. Plans must support integration of rich perspectives offered by diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, and other demographics. Gaps and barriers to creating this culture must be identified and addressed via goals, non-quantitative milestones, and intended actions to successfully build a culture of inclusion. Diversity at all levels of students, staff and faculty must be considered. Programs, some of them NSF-funded (e.g., ADVANCE, etc.), and offices (e.g., Minority, Multicultural or Women in Engineering Programs, etc.) at lead and domestic partner universities, should be leveraged in support of the plan at each campus. The roles and commitments of the deans and collaborating department chairs should be specified in the plan.</p>
       
            <p><strong>2.d. Organization and Management Systems</strong>: The ERC Director must report to the Dean of Engineering of the lead university. The ERC must have sound management systems to assure effective integration. These include systems for financial management, data reporting, project selection and assessment that include regular input from all leadership team members and the Scientific and Industrial/Practitioner Advisory Boards.</p>
      
            <p><strong>2.e. Facilities, Equipment, Safety, and Headquarters</strong>: The lead university must commit to provide sufficient headquarters space and resources to support the leadership, management, and collaboration functions of the ERC. The ERC's research teams will be supported by appropriate research equipment and shared facilities, shared data, shared experimentation, shared simulations and test beds. The ERC will assure safe laboratory environments and safety training for its students across domestic partner universities and abroad. The Center will work with the administration at each university to monitor and assure safety.</p>
     
            <p>A robust cyberinfrastructure, with appropriate software and staff, should be in place to facilitate collaboration. The NERCs will link with the resources of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) as the main cyber platform for development and dissemination of any computational and simulation tools and educational materials developed by the NERC. Information about the NCN can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.ncn.purdue.edu/">http://www.ncn.purdue.edu/</a>. The NERC equipment plan will include efforts to leverage the experimental resources of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) and the computational resources of the NCN. Information about the NNIN can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nnin.org/">http://www.nnin.org/</a>.</p>
          
            <p><strong>2.f. Institutional Commitment</strong>: The lead and partner universities must support the Center's research, education, and innovation culture; augment NSF's support during the award period through cost-sharing and other means; and sustain the ERC once NSF's support ceases. University students engaged in mentoring of other university students and in pre-college outreach should receive credit or official recognition for such activities. Core and partner academic institutions must commit to:</p>
        
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Join in partnership to support the ERC's vision, strategic plans, and activities in research, workforce development and innovation. </li>
                <li>Assure cross-university industrial membership and IP policies that recognize shared rights for joint work; </li>
                <li>Support the ERC's plans for diversity and building a culture for inclusion and success for all;</li>
                <li>Institute policies to reward faculty, particularly those in the tenure and promotion process, for participating in cross-disciplinary research and innovation, technological advance and innovation, mentoring, university and pre-college education, and delivering on the ERC's plans for workforce development and inclusiveness. </li>
              </ul>
          </ol>
              <p><strong>D. Financial Scope and Scale of the ERC</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>NSF Award Size</strong>: Start-up base support will not exceed $3,500,000 for year one. Pending satisfactory annual performance, need, and availability of funds, the base support may increase to $3,750,000 (year 2), $4,000,000 (year 3), $4,250,000 (year 4), and $4,250,000 (year 5). Pending performance and the outcome of two renewal reviews in the third and sixth year, support for years six through eight is projected to be up to $4,250,000 in each of those years; and support for year nine and ten will be phased down at a reduced level of 33% of the prior year's support to prepare the ERC for self-sufficiency from ERC program support at the end of 10 years.</li><br />
            <li><strong>Cost Sharing</strong>: The lead and partner domestic universities will be committed to support and sustain the ERC through financial and in-kind cost sharing. Evidence of this cost sharing is required in the invited full proposal. The financial support allocated by the Center Director to the lead and partner university faculty will depend upon their roles in the ERC; and, post award, that support will depend upon performance and need and likely will vary over time. This will impact cost sharing over time.</li><br/ >
            <li> <strong>Total Support</strong>: Post-award, ERCs establish a Center-level account into which is deposited the ERC program base support and any other support provided directly by other sources (e.g., IPAB membership fees) to the Center to carry out its activities. In addition, ERCs may include support provided to a PI's department for supplementary projects that will be carried out under the ERC's Strategic Plan. This support is classified as associated project support in post-award financial reporting.</li></ol>

            <h3> V. PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            <h4>A. Proposal Preparation Instructions</h4>
            <p><strong>Letters of Intent <em>(required)</em></strong>:</p>
            <p>A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required to facilitate the NSF review process. The letter should be submitted via FastLane (not Grants.gov) no later than the LOI deadline date specified in this solicitation. The LOI allows NSF to screen the proposals with respect to eligibility requirements, to categorize the proposals according to general topical areas, and to identify conflicts -of-interest so as to prepare for the proposal review processes. The topics themselves will not be pre-screened.</p>
            <p>Submit information for your LOI through FastLane under these categories and only under these categories (note the character limits, which include spaces, as stated below):</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Title</strong>: For an open topic ERC, the title should begin with "NSF Engineering Research Center for <em>(insert the rest of the title and the Center's acronym)</em>&rdquo;. For an NERC, the title should begin with "NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for <em>(insert the rest of the title and the Center's acronym)</em>&rdquo;.</li>
              <li><strong>Center PI and Point of Contact for NSF Inquiries</strong>: Center Director's name, university, department, phone number, and e-mail address</li>
              <li><strong>Anticipated Center Co-PIs</strong> (maximum of four official Co-PIs): Because the proposal cover sheet only allows a total of five PIs (the PI and up to four Co-PIs), identify up to four Co-PIs. Include their names, universities, departments, and locations (city, state, country).</li>
              <li><strong>Anticipated Domestic Academic Partner Universities</strong>: This section should include only the domestic "academic partner universities" anticipated to partner in the ERC (not the universities that are contributing affiliated faculty, or federal laboratories, or foreign collaborators' universities). For each academic partner university include the name and location (city, state and country). Identify the partner university that would serve as the ERC underrepresented minority -serving institution. Each university entry can have up to 76 characters (including spaces) to show all requested information. Abbreviations can be used, as needed. A search for the organization can be done in FastLane, and if found in the search, then it can be added when selected from the list.</li>

          <p><strong>Invited Full Proposal Preparation Instructions (<em>by invitation only</em>):</strong> Full proposals may be submitted only by invitation.</p>
          <p>As a multi-university ERC, the proposal must be submitted as a single integrated proposal by the lead university, with proposed sub awards to the other partner institutions. Separate proposals from each partner will not be accepted, since separately submitted collaborative ERC proposals are not allowed.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Required Proposal Format: </em></strong></p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Cover Sheet:</strong> Select the ERC Program solicitation number from the pull down list. For an open topic ERC, the proposal title should begin with "Engineering Research Center for <em>(insert the rest of the title and the Center's acronym)</em>." For a NERC, the proposal title should begin with "NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for <em>(insert the rest of the title and the Centers acronym)</em>". The title should reflect the system focus of the proposed Center. For planning purposes, August 1, 2017 should be shown as the start date. The proposed Center Director must be shown as the Lead Principal Investigator.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Summary (limited to one page):</strong> ;The summary should be written in the third person (i.e., the use of the pronoun "it" not "we" to represent the ERC) and should make a compelling case for the ERC. The summary should be informative to persons working in the same or related fields; and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate lay reader.</li>
          <p>In the overview section, include the Center's title, the Center Director's name, the lead university's name, and the names of the partner universities. Write a brief clear description of the ERC, stating its vision and goals, the transformational nature of the systems technology, the fundamental barriers in the way of realization, and its impact on innovation and the engineering workforce through its education program.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposals that do not contain the Project Summary, including an overview and separate statements on Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts will not be accepted by FastLane or will be returned without review. Additional instructions for preparation of the Project Summary are available in FastLane.</strong></p>
          <li><strong>Table of Contents:</strong> will be generated automatically by FastLane or Grants.gov.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Description</strong></li>
          <p>The project description must contain sections (4.a) to (4.f) as described below. Section (4.a) is the Table of Academic/Other Participants and Industrial/Practitioner Members. The remainder of the Project Description is<strong> limited to 25 pages</strong> (Secs. 4.b. to 4.f.). It is subject to font and page limitations as discussed in the GPG. The 25 -page limit includes all figures, charts, and other tables required as a part of the narrative. <em><strong>If the Project Description exceeds the page limit, the proposal will be returned without review</strong></em>.</p>
          <p>The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the ERC must be addressed and described as an integral part of the narrative. However, a separate section on prior NSF support must<strong> not</strong> be included in the project description; rather this information must be integrated into discussion of state of the art in research and education. At the proposal section normally reserved for NSF support, the reader should be referred to the state of the art section of the proposal</p>
         <p><strong>4.a. Table of Academic/Other Participants and Industrial/Practitioner Members</strong> (Not included in the 25-page limit)<strong>. </strong>The table should be inserted at the beginning of the Project Description using the table format available on the ERC Association website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0">http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0</a>.

          <p>Please submit this table to <a href="mailto:ercintent@nsf.gov">ercintent@nsf.gov</a> the same day you submit the proposal. Include in the subject line: the proposal number, the name of the lead institution, and the words, "Participant Table."</p>
          <p>The following additional sections (4.b.) through (4.f.), <strong>limited to 25 pages maximum</strong>, of the Project Description should be prepared with reference to the review criteria and the guidance provided in this and the preceding sections of this solicitation. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the ERC must be addressed and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
          <p><strong>4.b. Vision and Rationale for the ERC. </strong>Articulate the vision of the proposed ERC and its engineered system, including the compelling national challenge(s) it addresses. The rationale for the value added of the proposed vision must include consideration of transformative, unique, and convergent characteristics. </p>
          <p><em>Compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR), if applicable</em>: If the proposed topical area has obvious dual use in both the military and civilian sectors, then note the following: The ERC solicitation requires international collaboration and offers the opportunity to establish a partnership with foreign researchers. Furthermore, there are often foreign students engaged in an ERC. Hence, PIs need to be cognizant of appropriate Department of State regulations, specifically the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and Department of Commerce regulations, specifically, Export Administration Regulations (EAR). If relevant to the technology proposed, the proposal should indicate awareness and compliance with the ITAR and EAR regulations in the section where the ERC's international collaboration is discussed. An ERC awardee under this solicitation will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the appropriate regulations. Please direct your specific questions on how to comply with these regulations to your university research administration office.</p>
          <p><strong>4.c. Research Program Broader Impact. </strong>The research program is the core of the ERC from which all center activities evolve. First, the strategic research plan must be presented using the ERC 3-plane chart framework followed by the details of the research program itself.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.c.1) Strategic Research Plan:</strong></em> Provide the strategic research plan of the proposed ERC.  Ensure the elements critical to the strategic research plan - context, critical path, resources, and adaptive - are addressed in entirety. A ten-year milestone chart (displayed in a font size that is readable) must illustrate the critical path, contributions from research projects, interdependence of research activities, short- and long-term deliverables, and overarching objectives in knowledge, technology, and proof of principle testbeds included in the Center's vision.  More clarity and specificity of milestones are expected for years 1 to 5. The format is not specified, but it must clearly indicate points of integration. A linear Gantt chart lacking points of interface or transitions is not effective. Impacts of the proposed research and technology outcomes on environment, human health and potential beneficiaries must be summarized. </p>
          <p>If an open topic ERC or a NERC develops nanoscale research simulation tools suitable for hosting on the cyber platform (<a href="http:www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nanohub.org/">http://www.nanohub.org/</a>) of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), those tools will be delivered to the NCN, where a broader community will have access to them in an open source mode for research and educational purposes. If applicable to the proposed ERC, include these plans in the proposal.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.c.2)</strong> <strong>Research Activities:</strong></em> Identify and characterize interdependent research thrusts and activities at fundamental knowledge, enabling technology, and systems-level test beds scales. Ensure the elements critical to the research activities - synergy, partnership, and system at scale - are comprehensively addressed. Integration of research activities must be graphically depicted on a fully legible version of the <strong>ERC Program's 3-Plane Strategic Planning Chart</strong> that is tailored to the proposed ERC. A sample chart is at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0">http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0</a>. </p>
          <p><strong>Each research thrust narrative</strong> must provide the following information. A <strong>readable table upfront</strong> must list the thrust leader and other faculty/research participants by name, their departments, and institutions. International partners who may be involved in the early stages of the thrust efforts must be listed.  Discuss the goals and objectives of the thrust vis-&agrave;-vis the goals of the ERC and the strategic research plan. Benchmark the research proposed for the thrust with respect to the state of the art (including the contributions of the proposed ERC faculty and others). Discuss the role of the thrust's research relative to the ERC's three-plane chart. Provide information on projected thrust -level fundamental knowledge and technology deliverables and on the gaps and barriers the thrust will address in the context of the ERC's strategic plan. Discuss the cross-disciplinary mix of expertise needed to achieve the goals of the thrust.</p>
          <p><strong>Project-level descriptions</strong> of specific research activities for each thrust must describe the proposed research and link it to the thrust goals. In the context of known results and theory, provide examples of fundamental barriers the research will address and project-level methods to address them. Demonstrate that the desired results constitute breakthroughs and are attainable in ten years. Discuss how projects support and integrate with other thrusts, enabling technologies, and systems level test beds.  Describe a few exemplar projects in depth to allow judgment of the quality of the effort proposed, rather than superficially describing all projects. </p>
          <p><strong>Enabling- and systems-level test beds</strong> must include a description of proposed proof-of-concept demonstration(s) in each testbed and personnel needed to construct and implement each proposed test bed. The research program budget should support technical staff at the appropriate time to work with students and faculty to build these test beds.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.c.3) Foreign collaborations</strong>:</em> Describe the strategy to develop foreign collaborations over time and justify their value added in research and workforce development. Foreign collaborations are not required to be in place by the time of the submission of the proposal; however such collaborations may be discussed if extant at the time of submission. </p>
          <p><strong>4.d. Engineering Workforce Development (EWD) Broader Impact.</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>(4.d.1) University Education:</em> </strong>Provide the strategic goals of the Center for contributing desired characteristics, the anticipated curricular impact of the ERC, and targeted skill sets of ERC graduate and undergraduate students along with enabling plans and approaches (&sect;II.B.2.a). Provide for global exchange of education and training including cyberinfrastructure and interaction with the NCN. </p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.d.2) Pre-college (and Community College - optional) Education:</strong></em> Provide the ERC's pre-college education program goals and strategies for engagement and partnership (&sect;II.B.2.b). Provide information on the school districts and/or individual schools that will partner with the ERC. Discuss the roles of the ERC's faculty and students and of the pre-college institutions administrators, teachers, and students. It is expected that this education plan will include evidence based engineering experiences to engage teachers and students.</p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.d.3) University and Pre-college Education Program Assessment</strong><strong>:</strong></em> Present the assessment plan to monitor progress and impacts of the EWD Programs to make improvements through time and assess their long-term impacts (&sect;II.B.2.c). (Note: Because of this type of process, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for research involving human subjects will have to be obtained.)</p>
          <p><em><strong>(4.d.4) Dissemination:</strong></em> Both the university and pre-college programs will disseminate EWD program outcomes and curriculum/outreach products to the participating partner and outreach institutions and as materials for workforce training. If a NERC or an open topic ERC develops nanoscale education simulation tools suitable for hosting on the cyber platform (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nanohub.org/">http://www.nanohub.org/</a>) of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), those tools will be delivered to the NCN, where a broader community will have access to them in an open source mode for educational purposes. If applicable to the proposed ERC, include these plans in the proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>4.e. Innovation Ecosystem Development - Industrial/Practitioner Members and Innovation Program Broader Impact.</strong></p>
          <p>Provide the ERC's innovation ecosystem strategic plan and goals for industrial/practitioner memberships and involvement; technology transfer to member and non-member firms; university and state and local government facilitators of entrepreneurship and innovation; and translational research (&sect;II.B.3).</p>
          <p>Provide a visualization of how the proposed member firms align to the value chain relevant to the proposed Center vision. That is, as the Center research program evolves, note at which points in time in the ERC program development over the 10-year period of NSF funding the different types of firms would engage with the Center to enable success. Some firms may be engaged for the entire 10 years, and some may be involved with focused research activities at critical points in time (e.g., test bed development).</p>
          <p>Discuss integration of the IPAB (&sect;II.B.3.b.1) in governance processes of the ERC, including the specific roles. Discuss the terms of the draft membership agreement including the proposed fee structure and benefits. Describe the type(s) of support to be received. A letter of commitment from each firm/practitioner organization committed to joining the ERC as a member and providing (cash and/or in-kind) support in the event that an award is made must be uploaded in Supplementary Documents. Do not include letters from those only interested in a partnership. </p>

          <h4> B. Budgetary Information</h4>
          <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
          <p>Cost Sharing is required.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Cost Sharing is required for Invited Full Proposals</p>
          <p>Invited full proposals will include a budget for each of the five years. FastLane or Grants.gov will automatically provide a cumulative budget. Provide a separate budget for subcontracts to the domestic partner institutions and any affiliated institutions whose faculty and would be supported by the ERC's budget. The budget for year one may be no more than $3,500,000, no more than $3,750,000 for year two, no more than $4,000,000 for year three, no more than $4,250,000 for year four, and no more than $4,250,000 for year five.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong> Mandatory Cost Sharing is required but inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.</p>
          <p><strong>Mandatory Cost Sharing Requirements and Policies: </strong></p>
          <p>Pursuant to the National Science Board's (NSB's) Recommendation 5 (as stated in NSB 09 -20) mandatory cost sharing for the NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) Program has been reinstated, since cost sharing is foundational to the strategic programmatic goals of the ERC Program.</p>
          <p>Cost sharing is required of the lead university and core domestic partner university(ies) to support and sustain the ERC. Cost sharing is not a review criterion for ERCs; it is an eligibility criterion. Because cost sharing is not a review criterion, details on cost sharing will not be shared with reviewers. Institutions that provide affiliated faculty, pre-college partners, and university, state and local government organizations devoted to entrepreneurship and innovation do not cost share. </p>
          <p>Upon issuance of the award, the lead university is responsible to secure, retain, manage, certify, and deliver to NSF the ERC cost sharing (cash and in-kind), at the level stated in the cooperative agreement. The total level of cost sharing proposed must be calculated using the "Cost Sharing Formula" below. The lead university is responsible for the entire amount; however cost sharing also can include contributions by any or all of the partner universities.</p>
          <p>Cost sharing must not exceed the mandatory level stated in the ERC cost sharing formula. This would be considered "voluntary committed cost sharing" which is specifically prohibited according to NSF's revised cost sharing principles. ERC proposals that include cost sharing amounts in excess of the specified formula run the risk of being returned without review or declined.</p>
          <p>Instructions for Disclosure and Non-Disclosure of Cost Sharing within the Proposal:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Cost Sharing and Letters of Commitment</strong></em>: Since cost sharing is not to be seen or considered by reviewers, any letters of commitment should not mention any cost sharing (cash or in-kind), since the reviewers will see these letters. See &sect;V.A.10.a for details concerning the letters of commitment.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cost Sharing in the Budget Submission</strong></em>: The proposed cost sharing (including the estimated value of any in-kind cost sharing), according to the formula below, must be shown on Line M of the NSF proposal budget form. (Line M is masked from reviewers.)</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cumulative cost sharing should be entered for all 5 years on Line M of the first year budget</strong></em>. Do not include the cost sharing figures on Line M of the budget for years 2-5. Do not include the justification / explanation for any cost-shared items in the budget justification section of the proposal. Only the non-cost shared items should be explained in the budget justification section, identifying the source, nature, amount and availability of non-cost shared items.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Cost Sharing Tables and Justification</em></strong>: The cost sharing commitment of the ERC must be documented in the proposal and the details presented in the tables of committed support. The lead institution is instructed to provide a table of "Committed Cash and In-Kind Academic Support, Years 1-5" (including any partner university providing cash for years 1-5). Proposers must also complete the table "Nature of In-Kind Support" identifying in-kind commitments and the sources of the commitments. A template of those tables can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0">http://erc-assoc.org/content/templates-proposal-preparation-0</a>. The tables should be uploaded into the single -copy documents section of the proposal. Append to the cost sharing tables a justification / explanation of the source, nature, amount and availability of any proposed cost sharing. Do not include these tables and the cost sharing justification in any other part of the proposal, as cost sharing commitments are not to be provided to reviewers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Cost Sharing Formula: </strong></p>
          <p>ERC cost sharing requirements are graduated based on classification at the time of LOI submission deadline as defined in the "Carnegie Foundation's Classification of Institutions of Higher Education." Limited financial resources at smaller colleges and universities that lack high research activity may present significant challenges to cost sharing. Therefore:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>RU/VH: Research Universities (very high research activity) - required cost sharing level is 20% of the allocation of the NSF budget to the lead or partner university;</li>
            <li>RU/H: Research Universities (high research activity) - required cost sharing level is 15% of the allocation of the NSF budget to the lead or partner university;</li>
            <li>DRU: Doctoral/Research Universities - cost sharing level is 10% of the allocation of the NSF budget to that partner university;</li>
            <li>Master's L: Master's Colleges and Universities (larger programs) - cost sharing level is 10% of the allocation of the NSF budget to that partner university/college;</li>
            <li>Bac/Diverse: Baccalaureate Colleges--Diverse Fields - cost sharing level is 5% of the allocation of the NSF budget to that partner college.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the university is classified in more than one Carnegie category, it must cost share at the highest cost sharing category as described above. The Carnegie classification shall remain throughout the duration of the competition and any subsequent award. The total ERC cost share shall be 20% or less, depending upon the Carnegie classifications for each of the partners.</p>
          <p><strong>ERC Support Cost-Sharing Sources:</strong></p>
          <p>The proposed cost sharing must be shown on Line M on the proposal budget. For purposes of budget preparation, the cumulative cost sharing amount must be entered on Line M of the first year's budget. Should an award be made, the organization's cost sharing commitment, as specified on the first year's approved budget, must be met prior to award expiration.</p>
          <p>Such cost sharing will be an eligibility, rather than a review criterion. Proposers are advised not to exceed the mandatory cost sharing level or amount specified in the solicitation.</p>
          <p>When mandatory cost sharing is included on Line M, and accepted by the Foundation, the commitment of funds becomes legally binding and is subject to audit. When applicable, the estimated value of any in-kind contributions also should be included on Line M. An explanation of the source, nature, amount and availability of any proposed cost sharing must be provided in the budget justification. Contributions may be made from any non-Federal source, including non-Federal grants or contracts, and may be cash or in-kind. 2 CFR &sect; 200.306 describes criteria and procedures for the allowability of cash and in-kind contributions in satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements. It should be noted that contributions derived from other Federal funds or counted as cost sharing toward projects of another Federal agency must not be counted towards meeting the specific cost sharing requirements of the NSF award.</p>
          <p>Failure to provide the level of cost sharing required by the NSF solicitation and reflected in the NSF award budget may result in termination of the NSF award, disallowance of award costs and/or refund of award funds to NSF by the awardee.</p>

          <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
          <p>The overall Center-level budget should be prepared to assure sufficient funding from all sources to achieve the goals of the ERC. Hence, this budget would include faculty and staff to support the research, education, industrial collaboration/innovation, and management of the ERC. Budgets should include resources for reporting, site visit costs, and travel for cross-ERC collaboration and NSF meetings. The budget submitted to NSF will include an allocation plan for the NSF funding only.</p>

          <h3> VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES </h3>
          <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
          <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
          <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
          <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
          <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
          <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
          <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
          <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
          <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
            <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
            <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
          <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
          <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
          <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
          <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
            <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
                <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
            <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
            <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
            <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
          <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

          <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
          <h4> B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
          <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Site Visit Review, or Reverse Site Review.
          </p>
          <p>Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will need to address the following overarching questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>What is the compelling new idea and how does it relate to national needs?</em></li>
            <li><em>Why is a center necessary to tackle the idea?</em></li>
            <li><em>How will the ERC's infrastructure integrate and implement research, workforce development and innovation ecosystem development efforts to achieve its vision?</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
          <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
          <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
          <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

          <h3> VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
          
          <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
          <h4> A. Notification of the Award</h4>
          <p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
         <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
          <h4> B. Award Conditions</h4>
          <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
          <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
          <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
           <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
           <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
          <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
          <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
          <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
          <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
          <p>NSF requires ERCs to submit annual reports that are more extensive in scope than those required of single investigator awards. NSF provides guidelines for these reports. NSF also requires ERCs to collect and submit to NSF data on indicators of progress, outcome, impact, and financial management. NSF provides data definition guidelines and templates for the recording and submission of these data through a secure web site.</p>

          <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
          <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
          <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
          <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
          <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

          <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
          <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
