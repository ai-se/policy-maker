<p>April 15, 2016</p>

<p>Dear Colleague:</p>

<p>NSF has identified improvement in graduate student preparedness for entering the workforce (<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/40262?view=public#apg">http://www.performance.gov/node/40262?view=public#apg</a>) as one of its Agency Priority Goals. As part of this goal, supplemental funding is available in FY 2016 and FY 2017 to support science and engineering doctoral students so that they can acquire the knowledge, experience, and skills needed for highly productive careers, inside and outside of academe. NSF currently invests in a number of graduate student preparedness activities, and has historically encouraged investigators to include such activities in proposals. This Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) describes a variety of opportunities across the Foundation designed to explore approaches that will position NSF-funded graduate students for success in the 21st century Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce.</p>

<p>NSF will consider support for supplements to existing research awards to enhance professional development opportunities for students in PhD programs as described by each Directorate/Office. These descriptions can be found below<em></em>. Interested investigators should contact the cognizant program officers listed on the opportunities. <em>Enhanced experience</em> supplements will enable single/collaborative awardees to request appropriate levels of additional support for existing graduate students to acquire professional development experience that will broaden avenues for entering the workforce. These supplements would provide graduate students with the opportunity to augment their research assistantships, and in some cases fellowships and traineeships, with additional "mentoring" activities and short-term training opportunities. <em>Enhanced activities</em> supplements will be available to existing, larger institution-level, "center-like" activities to support cohorts of graduate students with the goal of developing new "best practice activities" for enhancing graduate student preparedness for entering the workforce.</p>

<h2>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>Although graduate student preparedness activities to be supported vary by Directorate/Office, a common set of metrics will be developed and provided to awardees at the time their award is made. These metrics will assist in verifying the impacts and benefits of approaches described in this Dear Colleague Letter. In addition, successful applicants are expected to report on graduate student professional development resulting from this supplemental support in the annual report of the award under which this support was received.</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENT-STUDENT VITA TEMPLATE (1 PAGE LIMIT)</h2>

<P><strong>Please submit this document as "Other Supplementary Documents"</strong></p>

<p>We encourage students supported by opportunities described in this Dear Colleague Letter to register for an ORCID ID and for this identifier to be provided to NSF in the investigators" annual report. ORCID&reg; (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://orcid.org">http://orcid.org</a>) is an open, non-profit, community-driven effort to create and maintain a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers. An ORCID identifier provides a unique and persistent digital identifier to distinguish individual researchers. While NSF encourages the use of an ORCID ID, submission of the ORCID identifier is optional.</p>

<p><em>Summary of Opportunity</em></p>

<P>The Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) invites its grantees to apply for supplemental funding to enhance the training experience of their doctoral students. Funding is available to support two types of activities. First, funding may be requested to support student participation in experiences that extend beyond their discipline and/or broaden their career options. For example, funds may be used to support the student for a brief internship period in the private, non-profit or academic arena, or to obtain specialized skills in a cross-disciplinary setting. Second, funds may be requested to compensate trainees to attend professional development courses (not formal degree programs) that enhance skills needed to be competitive in the job market. Courses with special emphasis on training in quantitative biology and/or acquiring skills that improve broader impacts (e.g., communicating science to the public) will be considered a priority.</p>

<p><em>Eligibility</em></p>

<P>This opportunity is open only to PhD students of MCB grantees. The proposed activity should not negatively impact the student's dissertation research or inadvertently increase the time to degree.</p>

<p><em>Preparation Instructions and Allowable Costs</em></p>

<P>Supplement requests are limited to 2 pages and should include the student's CV following the template specified in this DCL as well as a statement of purpose written by the student. The average award is expected to range from $6,000 - $12,000 for a period of one year, and will depend on the availability of funds. Eligible costs can include travel and tuition fees. This is a pilot program that will run for two years.</p>

<p><em>Submission and Review</em></p>

<p>We anticipate making no more than 15 awards per year. Supplemental requests will be considered on a first-come, first-served basis. Investigators are encouraged to contact their cognizant program directors for more information.</p>

<p>Requests should be made no later than May 20, 2016 for FY 2016 consideration and no later than April 3, 2017 for FY 2017 consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="ENG" id="ENG"></a>DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING (ENG)</h2>

<p><em>Summary of Opportunity</em></p>

<p>The Directorate for Engineering (ENG) invites Principal Investigators of active ENG research grants to request supplemental funding for PhD students currently supported by the grant. The purpose of this supplemental funding opportunity is to provide necessary support for engineering doctoral students to acquire the knowledge, experience, and skills that complement their research project and help better prepare them for future careers, inside and outside of academe.</p>

<p>With rapidly accelerating changes in technology driven global and national economies, it is expected that today's PhD graduates will have varied career paths over their professional lives. Engineering PhDs have the potential to make important contributions in careers outside academia: in companies ranging from startups to large corporations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. The 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients has shown that 73% of PhD holders in engineering are in non-academic employment while only 27% pursue academic jobs (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/">https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/</a>). Among new PhD graduates, the percentage going into academic careers is estimated to be even lower. It is therefore important that research assistants working on NSF grants be provided opportunities to develop skills that prepare them to be successful for a broad range of career paths. In addition to deep and broad preparation in their technical areas of expertise, skills and knowledge regarding communication, innovation &amp; entrepreneurship, leadership &amp; management, policy and outreach are becoming increasingly valuable to enter the workforce. Such skills and knowledge also benefit doctoral students entering academia due to an increased need to communicate the value of the research and its broader impact, to collaborate with other researchers, and to mentor students.</p>

<p><em>Supplement Categories</em></p>

<p>The lead investigator of an active ENG award may request supplemental funding for a doctoral student supported on the award to gain knowledge, skills and experiences that will augment their preparation for a successful long-term career. It is expected that the experience facilitated with this supplement will allow students to gain additional skills in one of the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Science and Engineering Communication (to both discipline-specific and broader audiences)</li>
 <li>Engineering Innovation and Technology Commercialization</li>
 <li>Business and Entrepreneurship</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of experiences include but are not limited to the following: summer workshops and courses; internships in start-ups, such as those funded through the NSF's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, accelerators, industry; internships in government, policy think-tank, regulatory agencies; and internships in non-profit Foundations.</p>

<p><em>Eligibility</em></p>

<p>This supplemental funding opportunity is open to principal investigators supporting doctoral students with an active NSF award from the Directorate for Engineering. This opportunity is not available to doctoral students supported by Engineering Research Center (ERC) awards, since ERCs already provide critical skills beyond those essential for the research component of academic and industry careers. Graduate students must have completed at least one year as a full time student, passed their qualifying exam (or equivalent requirement towards candidacy), and be making satisfactory progress towards the completion of their degree. These requirements must be certified by the graduate program lead for the institution.</p>

<p><em>Preparation Instructions and Allowable Costs</em></p>

<p>It is expected that the student and supervisor will work together to identify innovative experiences (see supplement categories) that add the most value. Supplemental requests must satisfy the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Two-page proposal identifying the category (see supplement categories) where skills are sought and the mechanism that will be used to acquire the skills, such as course work, workshop or internship, etc. The proposal must include a concise statement from the student describing how the activity will better prepare him/her to enter the workforce.</li>
 <li>One-page resume of the student following the template specified in this DCL.</li>
 <li>Letter from the graduate program lead certifying that the student meets eligibility requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigators are encouraged to discuss with their cognizant NSF program manager activities that are synergistic with the project scope. The maximum supplement request is $10,000. ENG plans to fund 15-20 supplements in FY 2016, depending on availability of funds. Funds may be used to support travel, tuition and fees, stipend and temporary relocation costs for the graduation student. Spouse and dependent travel are not allowed.</p>

<p><em>Submission and Review</em></p>

<p>Proposals will be reviewed internally at NSF.</p>

<p>The deadline for applications to this opportunity is May 20, 2016.</p>
