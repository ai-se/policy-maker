<h3><a NAME="INTRO">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h3>
<P>Computational geometry has been a rich and highly productive field of mathematical 
  and computational research. That success has opened new and promising problem 
  areas, while some existing topics have been seen to require a new approach. 
  This solicitation targets three topics for support: computational geometry and 
  topology, computational cartography, and computer aided design. Awards will 
  be either smaller incubator grants, or larger team grants to interdisciplinary 
  groups of PIs.</P>
<h3><a NAME="DESC">II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</a></h3>
<P>RESEARCH THEMES</P>
<P>This solicitation focuses on three high-risk/high-reward research areas, where 
  special opportunities exist for fundamental studies. Research in these areas 
  is expected to have significant impact across numerous application domains, 
  including engineering design, modeling of physical systems, and several aspects 
  of computational and geometric cartography. The three areas are as follows.</P>
<P>* Computational geometry and topology</P>
<P>Computational topology is an extension of computational geometry, which has 
  proven to be both a rich and highly productive area of mathematical and computational 
  science research, with numerous applications in such fields as computer graphics, 
  robotics, and computer-aided design. To date, most of the activity has been 
  focused on discrete problems and has made extensive use of combinatorial techniques 
  to address these problems. There is a need to extend the current body of work 
  in computational geometry, where objects are typically represented by point 
  sets, polygons, or polyhedra, to include representations of continuous domains, 
  curved surfaces, and higher dimensional objects. Such extensions are expected 
  to bring computational geometry into contact with many areas in classical geometric 
  topology, just as the mainstream computational geometry led to connections with 
  combinatorial geometry. </P>
<P>The foundational research of computational topology has already begun separately 
  within the topology, computational geometry, computer graphics, and other communities 
  of mathematical and computational science. Each of these fields has developed 
  its own approach to investigating problems in shape representation, manipulation, 
  and analysis. So far, algorithms are typically specific to certain data representations 
  and underlying topological questions common to all the approaches have not received 
  adequate attention. In addition to the intrinsic mathematical value of this 
  new vein of research, there is reason to expect that computational topology 
  can lead to well-founded and robust algorithms for computer-aided design, graphics 
  and visualization, and terrain analysis. These algorithms will offer substantial 
  advantages over current algorithms that are largely limited to discrete geometric 
  computations approximating the underlying problems involving smooth or piecewise 
  smooth objects. Additionally, there is a need to introduce spatial statistics 
  into computational representations of geometrical and topological objects, to 
  account for uncertainty in data and computational errors. This has not been 
  extensively explored and exhibits great potential.</P>
<P>* Computer aided design (CAD)</P>
<P>The efficiency and reliability of modern CAD systems, as well as the compatibility 
  of CAD models with downstream applications (e.g., stress analysis and computational 
  fluid dynamics), are severely limited by the persistent lack of robust algorithms 
  for computing surface intersections and trimmed surfaces. The resolution of 
  these problems, which can have tremendous economic impact by reducing product 
  design and verification cycles, is expected to require interdisciplinary expertise 
  from topology, algebraic and differential geometry, numerical analysis, computational 
  algebra, and the engineering application contexts. The issue of guaranteed "topological 
  consistency" must be a central guiding principle in the development of innovative 
  new algorithms and approaches to these fundamental CAD problems. Bringing collaborative 
  teams of mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers together to explore 
  the development and application of Computational Topology in the context of 
  CAD is a significant opportunity for providing coherence and basis to this, 
  commercially and militarily, important technology. </P>
<P>* Computational cartography</P>
<P>The major fundamental problem in computational and geometric cartography is 
  developing representations that respect the particular properties of terrain 
  elevation. Since elevation usually has no high order continuity, traditional 
  representations involving linear combinations of basis functions are inadequate. 
  In addition, terrain has large complexes of long-range relationships, such as 
  drainage networks. Operations, such as lossy compression, whose design ignores 
  this will generate impossible terrain. Quality metrics must encourage the preservation 
  of derived properties such as visibility instead of simply minimizing elevation 
  errors. New representations and algorithms must be cognizant of the large amounts 
  of data becoming available from LIDAR and other sources. This data, from multiple 
  sources of varying resolutions and reliabilities, and containing differing terrain 
  features (e.g., vegetation, transportation routes, hydrology, drainage), must 
  be conflated, with its mutual inconsistencies resolved. </P>
<P>New algorithms applying these representations to problems such as visibility 
  determination and mobility analysis, among others, are also of great interest. 
  Useful solutions will execute quickly on large data sets and will typically 
  employ compact data structures that are easy to implement and test, consume 
  less bandwidth, and are amenable to parallel implementation. </P>
<P>The characteristics of the data raise several avenues of investigation, including 
  analysis of output versus input accuracy, the computational benefits of employing 
  "just good enough" algorithms, and the manifestation of errors in input data 
  at different levels of a hierarchical representation structure. Robust solutions, 
  tolerant of data errors, although possibly suboptimal, are desirable. Here, 
  analysis of error propagation in spatial networks of differing resolution and 
  accuracy is of great computational benefit.</P>
<P>This research will have a wide impact. A proper terrain model will provide 
  a formal basis for many terrain analysis problems. Terrain visibility determination 
  is a component of the siting of radio transmitters, environmental visual nuisances, 
  and military observers. Siting radio relays will be particularly important on 
  the Moon, which has only line-of-sight radio communication, and Mars, which 
  has a weak ionosphere. Mobility analysis, including the generation of a combined 
  obstacle overlay, is of considerable defense and civilian interest in any region 
  where the roads are inadequate or even nonexistent. </P>
<P>This solicitation aims to replace currently isolated research niches in the 
  above areas, which impinge on each other, with a cohesive research community, 
  to harness their potential in a wide spectrum of applications, and to impact 
  the research community by enlarging the pool of principal investigators.</P>
<P>MODES OF SUPPORT</P>
<P>We particularly encourage proposals for efforts involving collaborations of 
  experts in the mathematical and computational sciences with other scientists, 
  engineers, and practitioners representing diverse application areas. Proposals 
  for incremental improvements of ongoing efforts will not be selected for funding. 
</P>
<P>This solicitation will support two types of awards:</P>
<ol>
  <li> Incubation awards will develop new collaborations of mathematical scientists, 
    computer scientists, and application experts relevant to the objectives of 
    the CARGO program. <br>
  </li>
  <li> Team awards will support groups of investigators. An ideal team would include 
    expertise in the mathematical sciences, computer science, computational science, 
    and engineering, and would have connections to industry or government laboratories. 
    An underlying awareness of real-world needs (which may arise from industrial 
    or defense applications) and the ultimate impact of the proposed activity 
    on such needs will be a central criterion in proposal evaluation. Expertise 
    in computational science, algebra, topology, all areas of geometry, spatial 
    statistics, compiler design, and computer graphics could benefit such teams.</li>
</ol>
<P>Potential participants seeking collaborators are encouraged to see the 'Team 
  Building' information below.</P>
<P>PROPOSAL CONTENTS</P>
<P>Proposals should address the major technical themes outlined above in integrated 
  and mathematically rigorous fashion and in contexts consistent with the goals 
  of this effort. In addition to offering substantial scientific innovation, proposals 
  should also address model problems, demonstrations, validation, and technology 
  transfer relevant to industrial and/or defense applications of these innovations. 
</P>
<P>Integration of research and education is of increasing importance across all 
  NSF programs. Proposals should present a plan describing how the proposed effort 
  will contribute to this objective.</P>

  or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
<p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below 
  (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal 
  Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations 
  that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will 
  apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review 
  criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that 
  are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified 
  to make judgements.</p>
<ul>
  <b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br>
  How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
  within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer 
  (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will 
  comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed 
  activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived 
  and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? 
</ul>
<ul>
  <b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br>
  How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting 
  teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden 
  the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, 
  geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research 
  and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? 
  Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological 
  understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? 
</ul>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding 
  decisions: </p>
<ul>
  <i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br>
  One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration 
  of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it 
  supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant 
  opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as 
  researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts 
  that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through 
  the diversity of learning perspectives. 
</ul>
<ul>
  <i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br>
  Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women 
  and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential 
  to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this 
  principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities 
  it considers and supports. 
</ul>
<ul>
  <B>Additional Review Criteria</B><BR>
  In addition to these general review criteria, reviewers will be asked to incorporate 
  the following criteria when reviewing proposals received in response to the 
  CARGO solicitation.</P>
  <P>* The central role of computational and mathematical sciences in formulating 
    and solving the problems, as well as the level and quality of computational 
    and mathematical innovation.</P>
  <P>* The likelihood of the impact of the proposed work on defense and industrial 
    applications. </P>
  <P>* The nature, extent and quality of new or significantly enhanced interactions 
    between mathematical and computer scientists and other scientists and engineers.</P>
  <P>* The effectiveness of the plan for integration of research and education, 
    especially regarding efforts to engage graduate students and postdoctoral 
    researchers in multidisciplinary projects.</P>
</ul>
<p><b><a NAME="REVIEWPROT">B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service 
  Standard</a></b></p>
<p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside 
  NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal. Proposals 
  will be evaluated through a competitive external merit review process that will 
  be managed jointly by NSF and DARPA. The awards will be made by NSF. Site visits 
  to finalists in the competition may be performed. <BR>
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or 
  decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
  review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted 
  by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. 
  Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the identities of reviewers, are sent 
  to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, 
  the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline 
  funding.</p>
In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after his or 
her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved by the Division 
Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee of an eventual award. 
<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have 
  been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval 
  begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation or the date of proposal 
  receipt (whichever is later). The interval ends when the Division Director accepts 
  the Program Officer's recommendation. </p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
  recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements 
  for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing 
  and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only 
  a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards 
  on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the 
  part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with 
  a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial 
  or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement 
  signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at one's own risk. </p>
<h3><a NAME="AWARDADMIN">VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</a></h3>
<h4>A. <a NAME="AWARDNOTIFY">Notification of the Award</a></h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by 
  a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose 
  proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant 
  NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, 
  not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to 
  the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A. for additional information on 
  the review process.)</p>
<h4>B. <a NAME="GRANTCOND">Award Conditions</a></h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special 
  provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) 
  the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which 
  NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals 
  or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the 
  award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions 
  (NSF-GC-1)* or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions;* 
  and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference 
  in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance 
  with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail 
  notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that 
  have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from 
  the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<B>Special Award Conditions</B><BR>
- PIs will be expected to attend an annual program meeting, to present their work 
to each other, and to exchange ideas. </P>
<P>- The third year of the team awards is contingent on the availability of funds, 
  and on progress to date, based on site visits and/or progress reports. 
<p><a NAME="REPORTREQ"><b>C. Reporting Requirements</b></a></p>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), 
  the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer 
  at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
<p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to 
  submit a final project report. Approximately 30 days before expiration, NSF 
  will send a notice to remind the PI of the requirement to file the final project 
  report. Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing 
  of pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required 
  reports in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
<p>NSF has implemented an electronic project reporting system, available through 
  FastLane. This system permits electronic submission and updating of project 
  reports, including information on project participants (individual and organizational), 
  activities and findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions. 
  PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either 
  with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>
