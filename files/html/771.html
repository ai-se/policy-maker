          <p><strong>A Competition of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)</strong></p>
          <p>The Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its two wave Child-Development
            Supplement (CDS) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative
            sample of US families begun in 1968. The PSID has collected 34 waves
            of data on the same families and their descendents as of 2005. The
            PSID has consistently obtained wave-to-wave reinterview response
            rates of 95-97%. Data have been posted on a web-based Data Center
            for the user community within 12 months of its collection. Substantial
            companion funds from other non-NSF agencies have been competitively
            won by the current vendor to support additional key data collection
            and post-data processing and dissemination activities.</p>
          <p>Programs in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences
            may make one award for the next five-year funding cycle, 2007-2011,
            to renew support for the PSID. We anticipate an NSF award of at least
            $12 million and at most $20 million to cover these activities, including
            three waves of data collection, over a five-year period. The annual
            amount of the award is expected to be at least $2.4 million and no
            more than $4 million. The duration of the award will be five years.
            The expected start date is January 1, 2006.</p>

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>The Economics Program and other programs in the Division of Social,
          Behavioral and Economic Sciences invite scholar-investigators who possess
          the theoretical, methodological, measurement, and administrative skills
          to undertake an important large-scale data collection project to submit
          proposals to conduct the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID).</p>
        <p>The PSID is the key data source about the economic and social well-being
          of U.S. families. The PSID and its two-wave Child Development Supplement
          (CDS) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample
          of US families begun in 1968. The PSID has collected 34 waves of data
          on the same families and their descendents as of 2005. The PSID has
          consistently obtained wave-to-wave re-interview response rates of 95-97%.
          Data have been posted on a web-based Data Center for the user community
          within 12 months of its collection. More information about the PSID
          is available at <a href="http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/">http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/</a></p>
        <p>The PSID consists of two elements. The first is the &ldquo;core&rdquo; PSID,
          which is 40 minutes of questionnaire content from 5,300 families. This
          part of the PSID is funded by the National Science Foundation. The
          second part of the PSID is made up of additional modules. These modules
          make up an additional 30 minutes of questionnaire content and an additional
          sample of approximately 3,000 low-income families. This award will
          not fund the additional modules that are part of the full PSID.</p>
      </div>
      <a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides fundamental
        cyberinfrastructure for the social and economic sciences. The award will
        fund seven activities: (1) three waves (2007, 2009, and 2011) of data
        collection on the historic core PSID sample of approximately 5,300 families
        and 40 minutes of content that will advance the quality of scientific
        inquiry and knowledge about the economic and social well-being of US
        families; (2) questionnaire development and innovation based on scientific
        expertise in relevant social sciences; (3) survey design that allows
        the addition of modules to meet the needs of federal agencies and other
        potential funders, should such agencies or organizations choose to fund
        specific modules; (4) post data collection editing, processing, and generation
        of constructed variables, data files and code books; (5) data dissemination
        within a cutting-edge web-based data archive; (6) provision of user assistance;
        and (7) support of an independent Board of Overseers. It is expected
        that in meeting these functions the PSID will explore and innovate cutting
        edge methods and technologies.
        <p>The current awardee (the University of Michigan) has successfully
          solicited companion funding from other Federal agencies. This funding
          has been used to provide two additional modules: an additional 30 minutes
          of questionnaire content and an additional low-income sample of approximately
          3,000 families, as well as significant additional processing and dissemination
          activities. The NSF award resulting from this solicitation will not
          fund these activities, but the ability to incorporate such modules
          by other sources is an important part of the design of the core PSID.</p>
        <p>The PSID's current Board of Overseers is an independent group. Board
          members are independent of the NSF and the current awardee, and represent
          the interests of the research and policy communities that use the PSID.
          The Board was established in 1981. New Overseers are nominated by the
          current board, and serve for two-year renewable terms. It is expected
          that proposals will be designed so that the Board of Overseers will
          continue to fulfill its important functions.</p>
        <p>This award will not support secondary data analysis or investigator-based
          research.</p>
        <p>Project descriptions should address the following Scientific Infrastructure
          Objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Possess scientific expertise and resources for questionnaire development
            and innovation;</li>
          <li>Continue collection of 3 biennial waves of questionnaire data from
            the 5,300 families in the core sample (approximately 40 minutes of
            core NSF-funded content) while maintaining the wave-to-wave reinterview
            response rate of 95-97%;</li>
          <li>Maintain continuity and the high quality of this data set;</li>
          <li>Capacity to produce modules that will meet the needs of other research-oriented
            Federal agencies and other potential funders;</li>
          <li>Ability to process, edit and release raw data, generated variables,
            and code books within 12 months of collection;</li>
          <li>Ability to maintain cyberinfrastructure to disseminate/share data
            and documentation with expansions and innovations in data sharing
            tools as technology develops;</li>
          <li>Continue generation of educational tutorials illustrating the use
            of the data to a variety of audiences; and</li>
          <li> Ability to maintain the following functions:
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>sensitive data dissemination archive;</li>
              <li>user help; and</li>
              <li>bibliographic and award archive.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Project Descriptions should also address the following administrative
          issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss the role of an independent Board of Overseers;</li>
          <li>Discuss the standards for data archiving and acquisition;</li>
          <li>Discuss plans for managing and integrating all PSID functions;</li>
          <li>If appropriate, the project description must include a section
            on Results From Prior Support for principal investigators and co-principal
            investigators who have received NSF funding in the last five years.
            Refer to the Grant Proposal Guide for more information; the Guide
            is available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub/cfm?gpg</a>; and</li>
          <li>All proposals submitted for the PSID competition must include a
            section titled &quot;Expected Project Significance&quot;. This section
            should address both the intellectual merit and the broader impacts
            of the project. The sections must identify how the project will generate
            new science related to the study of the economic and social well-being
            of US families, and how it will enhance the capabilities of people
            who engage in research and/or education in these areas in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current PSID awardee is the University of Michigan. They will
          provide any new awardee with data, documentation, and data collection
          software developed with past NSF funds. Contact Dr. Daniel Newlon for
          more information about the specific items that will be included.</p>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      </UL>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Ad Hoc
        and/or panel review. </p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation,
        or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends
        when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special
        provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto;
        (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense,
        on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific
        approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal
        referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions,
        such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration
        Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or
        other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
      <P>OMB control number: 3145-0058.</P>
