      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc and/or
        panel review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P> In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after
        his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved
        by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee
        of an eventual award. </P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
        special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
        thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
        expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
        any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
        the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
        conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal
        Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement
        or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements. </p>
      <p> *These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
