      <div class="user_input">
        <P>The National Science Foundation and the Division of Advanced Networking 
          Infrastructure and Research (ANIR) have had a profound effect on science 
          and engineering research and education through support of computer networking, 
          beginning in 1986 with NSFNET and continuing through 2002 with the vBNS 
          and then the Internet2 Abilene network. To date 210 universities and 
          research facilities have received NSF high performance connections awards. 
        </P>
        <P>The number of researchers in the higher education community who require 
          access to high performance networks continues to grow, the range of 
          applications continues to expand, and the technology continues to evolve 
          (e.g., grid computing). High performance networks have become&nbsp;critical 
          tools, enabling research and education at the forefront of science and 
          engineering where high performance network services such as tele-collaboration, 
          distributed high performance computing, data mining, and remote visualization 
          and imaging are increasingly employed. </P>
        <P>The current need is to continue extending access to an advanced network 
          while training the next generation of scientists, engineers, and other 
          researchers and educators&nbsp;to effectively utilize these tools so 
          they may generate the creative ideas of the future. </P>
      </div>
      <a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a> <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <P>This program supports the establishment of high performance connections 
          to advanced Internet facilities (such as the vBNS or Abilene) to: </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>enable identified cutting edge science and engineering research 
            and education applications with special network requirements (such 
            as high bandwidth and/or bounded latency) that cannot readily be met 
            through commodity network service providers. Such advanced network 
            connections will be at or above 45 Mbps, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, and other 
            researchers and educators&nbsp;to understand and use the network.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>In the past, the program has primarily focused on cutting-edge research. 
          However in this announcement, the programmatic focus includes and extends 
          beyond research, to include aspects of network sustainability and advanced 
          networking education for students, particularly those in underserved 
          areas. </P>
        <P>A portion of the award may be used to purchase equipment (e.g., a small 
          cluster of computers) that will directly enable research and&nbsp;education.</P>
        <P>Institutions may propose to connect their local network infrastructure 
          to the national research network infrastructure by any appropriate technique, 
          for example, </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>acquiring services from a network service provider,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>connecting to a gigapop, or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>connecting to a university that already has a high performance connection.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>The high performance connection must be interconnected with an appropriate 
          local network infrastructure. </P>
      </div>
      <a name="elig"></a> <h3>III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION</h3>

          with industry or government laboratories are encouraged where appropriate. 
        </P>
        <P>Proposals from groups of institutions, where none of the institutions&nbsp;have 
          been previously funded by NSF for a high performance connection, are 
          encouraged, where the proposers can, in addition to meeting the other 
          criteria outlined below, demonstrate a clear cost savings by connecting 
          together rather than separately. </P>
        <P>Due to the limited availability of funds, prospective applicants are 
          urged to contact the Cognizant Program&nbsp;Officer for guidance.</P>

      <a name="budg_cst_shr_txt"></a> <h4>B. Budgetary Information</h4>
      <p><b>Cost Sharing:</b></p>
      <div class="user_input">Cost sharing may include, but is not limited to, 
        any portion of the costs of the high performance connection itself (e.g. 
        circuit costs, circuit installation charges), software/equipment costs 
        needed to interface campus network infrastructure to the external high 
        performance connection (e.g., border routers or switches) not covered 
        in the award.</div>
      <p>Cost sharing at a level of 100 percent of the requested total amount 
        of NSF funds is required for all proposals submitted in response to this 
        announcement/solicitation. The proposed cost sharing must be shown on 
        line M on the proposal budget. Documentation of the availability of cost 
        sharing must be included in the proposal.</p>
      <p>Only items which would be allowable under the applicable cost principles, 
        if charged to the project, may be included in the awardee's contribution 
        to cost sharing. Contributions may be made from any non-Federal source, 
        including non-Federal grants or contracts, and may be cash or in kind 
        (see OMB Circular A-110, Section 23). It should be noted that contributions 
        counted as cost sharing toward projects of another Federal agency may 
        not be counted towards meeting the specific cost sharing requirements 
        of the NSF award.</p>
      <p>All cost sharing amounts are subject to audit. Failure to provide the 
        level of cost sharing reflected in the approved award budget may result 
        in termination of the NSF award, disallowance of award costs and/or refund 
        of award funds to NSF.</p></p>
      <a name="budg_indr_cst_lim"></a> <p><b>Indirect Cost (F&amp;A) Limitations:</b></p>
      <div class="user_input">NSF will not reimburse the awardee for any indirect 
        costs associated with leased line costs and service provider fees. If 
        the organization's normal practice is to include these costs in their 
        indirect cost base, then the indirect cost amount for these two categories 
        will not be funded by NSF but may be used to meet the organization's cost 
        sharing.</div></p>

      <a name="review"></a> <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a> <p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited 
        from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research 
        or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers 
        charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer 
        to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate 
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with 
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic 
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to 
        that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
      <p>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals 
        at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsb9772">NSB 
        97-72</a>). All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit 
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional 
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs 
        and activities. </p>
      <p>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?iin127">Important 
        Notice 127</a>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements 
        Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces 
        the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review 
        of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal 
        processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed 
        when making funding decisions.</p>
      <p>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines 
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. 
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must 
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page 
        Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting 
        from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description 
        and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
      <p>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that 
        do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project 
        Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation 
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance 
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>
      <p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed 
        below (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant 
        Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria 
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are 
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers 
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address 
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered 
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p>
      <ul>
        <b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is 
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, 
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent 
        does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? 
        How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient 
        access to resources?
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting 
        teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity 
        broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, 
        disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure 
        for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, 
        and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance 
        scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of 
        the proposed activity to society?
      </ul>
      <p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making 
        funding decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br />
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster 
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects, 
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These 
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently 
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where 
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement 
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br />
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens 
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities 
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. 
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to 
        the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <span class="user_input"> <a name="rev_addl_crit_txt"></a> <b>Additional 
        Review Criteria</b><br>
        The following additional criteria will be used in the review process: 
        <OL>
          <LI>Quality of the proposed research application(s) that require the 
            high performance connection and evidence that the connection is required;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Adequacy of the network engineering plan, including clear involvement 
            of appropriate technical expertise in computer networking, if not 
            provided by local professionals, then available through arrangements 
            with appropriate third parties (e.g., gigapop operators, network service 
            providers, relationships with other campuses, or access to regional 
            support teams);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Adequate plan to sustain and increase the use of the network connection 
            (e.g., plan to extend the reach of the proposed connection beyond 
            the group of early adopters);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Adequate plan to enhance networking curricula for CS and/or non-CS 
            majors;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Adequate&nbsp;existing and/or proposed local network infrastructure 
            to&nbsp;deliver advanced network service to the desktops and facilities 
            of the intended end users;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Coordination of procedures with proposed network service providers;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Committment to provide for the future continuing support of the 
            proposed network connections as indicated by letters of commitment 
            from appropriate institutional officials;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
          <LI>Cost-effectiveness of the proposed network connection; evidence 
            of thoroughness of effort to obtain cost-effective connection. </LI>
        </OL>
        </span>
      </ul>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a> 
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer 
        Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons 
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the 
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation 
        will be reviewed by <span class="user_input"> <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a> 
        Panel Review. </span></p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support 
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
        review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted 
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. 
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are 
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. 
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision 
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p> In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after 
        his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved 
        by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee 
        of an eventual award. </p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals 
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time 
        interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the Division 
        Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and 
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications 
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers 
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, 
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of 
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical 
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator 
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence 
        of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements 
        Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
      <a name="awardadmin"></a> <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a> <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> 
        by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations 
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by 
        the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim 
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be 
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A. 
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a> <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special 
        provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; 
        (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, 
        on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific 
        approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal 
        referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such 
        as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership 
        (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance 
        that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative 
        agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative 
        Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail notification is 
        the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic 
        mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division 
        of Grants and Agreements. </p>

      <div class="user_input"><a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a> 
        <P>PIs of successful proposals will be required to attend a high-performance 
          network connections workshop.</P>
      </div>
      <a name="reportreq"></a> <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), 
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer 
        at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a> <p> Within 90 days after the expiration 
        of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final project report. 
        Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing 
        of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the 
        formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required 
        data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available 
        through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project 
        reports. This system permits electronic submission and updating of project 
        reports, including information on project participants (individual and 
        organizational), activities and findings, publications, and other specific 
        products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information 
        previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using 
        the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in 
        most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible 
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for 
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such 
        findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and 
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons 
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with 
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of 
        race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded 
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination 
        under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from NSF, 
        although some programs may have special requirements that limit eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> 
        (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
        persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student 
        research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter 
        II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types 
        of proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited 
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection 
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted by 
        awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the 
        Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed 
        to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review 
        process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data 
        regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration 
        of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers 
        and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government 
        agencies needing information as part of the review process or in order 
        to coordinate programs; and to another Federal agency, court or party 
        in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a 
        party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer 
        file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers 
        or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, "Principal 
        Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 
        267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated 
        Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998). Submission of the 
        information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, 
        however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
      <p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control 
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public 
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. 
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of this 
        collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, 
        to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of Administrative 
        Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</p>
