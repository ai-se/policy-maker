        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Despite centuries of discovery, most of our planet's biodiversity remains unknown. The scale of the unknown diversity on Earth is especially troubling given the rapid and permanent loss of biodiversity across the globe. The goal of the Dimensions of Biodiversity campaign is to transform, by 2020, how we describe and understand the scope and role of life on Earth.</p>
            <p>This campaign promotes novel integrative approaches to fill the most substantial gaps in our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. It takes a broad view of biodiversity, and focuses on the intersection of genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. Successful proposals must integrate these three dimensions to understand interactions and feedbacks between and among them. While this focus complements several core programs in BIO, it differs by requiring that multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed simultaneously, in novel ways, to understand their synergistic roles in critical ecological and evolutionary processes, especially pertaining to the mechanisms driving the origin, maintenance, and functional roles of biodiversity.</p>
            <p>The Dimensions of Biodiversity program again includes partnerships with the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and S&atilde;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) of Brazil in fiscal year 2017.</p>
            <p>Investigators wishing to inquire about the suitability of potential projects for Dimensions of Biodiversity are encouraged to email a brief summary and contact information to <a href="mailto:Dimensions@nsf.gov">Dimensions@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Life on Earth is astounding in its diversity and in its ability to transform the world. Despite centuries of discovery, the vast majority of our planet's diversity remains unknown. Only a few years ago scientists shared the view that the diversity of life on Earth was so vast that it might be beyond cataloging, much less understanding. This is no longer the case. Advances in our capacity to collect, analyze, and integrate biological data have provided tools with which researchers can significantly expand our knowledge of Earth's biodiversity and revolutionize our understanding of the living world. Unfortunately, the pace of discovery is increasingly offset by rapid and permanent loss of biodiversity. Drivers of biodiversity loss include climate change, over-exploitation of natural resources, planetary re-engineering (such as land use change, water diversions, coastal development, fertilizer use), and the intentional or unintentional movement of species. With biodiversity loss, humanity is losing links in the web of life that provide important ecosystem services, forfeiting opportunities to understand the history and future of the living world, and losing opportunities for future beneficial bio-inspired discoveries and innovations. This reality has stimulated a campaign of integrated study across the dimensions of Earth's biodiversity.</p>
          <p>Biodiversity research has often focused on single dimensions. For example, investigators have concentrated on the taxonomic diversity or phylogenetic history of a clade, the genetic diversity of a population or a species, or the functional role of a taxon in an ecosystem. Although this research has yielded important advances, huge gaps persist in our understanding of biodiversity. We understand little about how these various dimensions, individually and in concert, contribute to environmental health, ecosystem stability, productivity, resilience, and biological adaptation in response to rapid environmental change.</p>
          <p>By 2020, the Dimensions of Biodiversity program is expected to have transformed our understanding of the scope and role of life on Earth. Investigators are encouraged to propose projects that transcend traditional boundaries among areas of biodiversity research. The Dimensions program focuses on genetic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. <strong>Successful proposals will test hypotheses about biodiversity and must integrate across these three dimensions and investigate the dynamic interactions and feedbacks between and among them</strong>. While this focus complements several core programs in BIO, it differs by requiring that multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed and integrated in innovative ways to understand the roles of biodiversity in critical ecological and evolutionary processes. Examples are provided in the following section. Projects funded in the first six years of the program are listed at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16116/nsf16116.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16116/nsf16116.pdf</a></p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Dimensions of Biodiversity campaign takes a broad view of biodiversity that ranges from genes through species to ecosystems in an effort to integrate both descriptive and functional aspects of biodiversity on Earth. The long-term goal of the campaign is to develop an integrated understanding of the key dimensions of biodiversity in an ever-changing world.</p>

          <p>The Dimensions of Biodiversity program currently targets three fundamental dimensions of biodiversity - genetic diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity. <strong>Integration across these three dimensions is an essential aspect of all proposals. </strong>Genetic diversity includes genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic diversity. Phylogenetic diversity refers to reconstructing evolutionary relationships among lineages at and above the level of the population and how these relationships inform taxonomic understanding. Functional diversity refers to the roles that organisms play within populations, communities, and ecosystems, including the regulation of ecological processes and the role of key innovations in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales. Investigators are encouraged to study the dynamic relationships among these three dimensions and their associated feedbacks (Fig. 1). Proposals should seek to understand how these relationships and feedbacks change  and evolve over time. <strong>Because a primary goal of the program is to describe the largest unknown mechanisms driving the origin, maintenance, and functional roles of biodiversity, proposals that have the potential to fill large gaps in our understanding of biodiversity are particularly encouraged.</strong></p>
          <p>Examples of topics that might be addressed by Dimensions proposals include, but are not limited to, the integrated roles of the three dimensions of biodiversity in: food web and community stability or ecosystem resilience, sustainability or productivity, particularly with respect to environmental thresholds and alternate stable states; eco-evolutionary feedbacks across space and time; maintenance of symbioses; genetic/phylogenetic diversification enabled by natural selection on novel traits; ecological response to anthropogenic disturbances including climate change; carbon, nitrogen, and other biogeochemical cycles; and macroevolutionary patterns and rates of evolution.</p>
          <p>All projects must ensure that data and biological materials are collected, archived, digitized, and made available using methods that allow current and future investigators to access data to address new questions. Funded projects must disseminate project data broadly, using widely accepted electronic methods. Data publication via existing repositories (e.g., Genbank, Dryad, iDigBio, MorphBank, Open Tree of Life) is strongly encouraged. All projects will be expected to adhere to appropriate standards where they exist (e.g., for taxonomic, geospatial, ecological, gene and genome sequence data) and to identify and maintain data linkages across repositories where possible. <strong>As a condition of funding: any digitized data and/or digital media (e.g., images, audio files) of voucher material from the project must be made available through the online National Resource for Digitized Collections (iDigBio.org); and, any phylogenetic character matrices and trees must be formatted and deposited for inclusion within the Open Tree of Life (see </strong><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing">http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing</a> <strong>for instructions).</strong></p>
          <p>Proposals should focus on fundamental aspects of biodiversity research; those whose primary focus is applied in nature (e.g., food and drug development; biomedical prospecting, restoration or biodiversity management) are not eligible for funding. Projects that integrate multiple dimensions of biodiversity but largely repeat or replicate existing work will also not be funded. Additional examples of proposals that will not be considered by this program include: 1) projects that  address only the characterization of genetic diversity within a single population or species; 2) projects that focus on species surveys, discovery, inventories, or descriptions (including projects that solely focus on large-scale sequence acquisition, for example microbiome surveys, without integrating the three dimensions of biodiversity); 3) projects that address only taxonomic boundaries (e.g., species delimitation) using genetic markers; 4) phylogenetic and/or phylogeographic studies that do not also address the genetic and functional aspects of the focal group(s); and 5) projects that focus on marine biodiversity.  </p>
          <p>Research on biodiversity science that is focused exclusively on systematics, evolution, ecology, or ecosystem science is supported by NSF; however, proposals addressing those individual areas may not be directly applicable to the Dimensions of Biodiversity Program. <strong>Proposals that do not integrate the three dimensions as described herein will not be considered by the Dimensions of Biodiversity program and should be submitted to relevant NSF programs instead.  </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Research Proposals</strong></p>
          <p>Research projects must integrate all three dimensions of biodiversity (Fig. 1) with the goal of understanding the complex interactions and dynamic feedbacks among these dimensions. Innovative approaches that accelerate the characterization and understanding of these three dimensions of biodiversity are encouraged, as are empirical, experimental, theoretical, and modeling approaches. Projects may incorporate the context provided by one or more drivers of biodiversity loss (e.g. climate change; over-exploitation of natural resources; planetary re-engineering such as land use change, water diversions, coastal development, fertilizer use; and the intentional or unintentional movement of species), but this is not a requirement of the solicitation. Projects that also develop original computational methods or technology that will be useful to a wide community of researchers (e.g., informatics, instrumentation, imaging, analysis) and other tools specific to integrative biodiversity studies are also welcome.</p>
          <p>Both single investigator and collaborative efforts are acceptable. Investigators are encouraged to develop international collaborations if projects will characterize multiple dimensions of biodiversity and understand their ecological and evolutionary significance within a global context.</p>
          <p>International collaborators are encouraged to seek support from their respective funding organizations. Funding guidelines for involving international collaborators allow the following expenses to be included in the NSF budget:</p>
          <ul>
         <li> Travel expenses for US scientists and students participating in exchange visits integral to the project.</li>
          <li> Project-related expenses for international partners to engage in research activities while in the United States as project participants.</li>
          <li> Project-related expenses for US participants to engage in research activities while abroad.</li></ul>
          <p>NSF has agreements with the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) to jointly support US-China International Research Projects, as described below. NSF also has signed an agreement with the State of S&atilde;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil to jointly support US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research projects, as described below. These agreements do not preclude other international collaborations.</p>
          <p><strong>US-China Collaborative Research Projects</strong></p>
          <p>For FY2017 the US-China partnership will support research projects that integrate the three dimensions of biodiversity as described in this solicitation. <em><strong>The deadline for NSFC is 24 February 2017</strong></em>. </p>
          <p>For US-China Collaborative projects, NSF will fund up to $2,000,000 to support the activities of US researchers and NSF-China has agreed to provide up to &yen;3,000,000 to Chinese participants. The proposal budget submitted to NSF should include only the costs of US participants; the anticipated budget for Chinese participants should be submitted as a supplementary document.</p>
          <p>NSF and NSFC will each independently review proposals and then come to agreement about which projects to support. NSF will manage the review of US-China Collaborative project proposals in accordance with NSF policies and procedures. At the end of that review process, reviews of proposals that NSF has an interest in funding will be shared with NSFC, but reviewer names will be redacted. Coordinated support will be arranged for successful proposals by the participating organizations, with NSF funding the US participants and NSFC funding Chinese participants through its standard award process.</p>
          <p><strong>US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research Projects</strong></p>
          <p>For FY2017 NSF will continue the partnership with the S&atilde;o Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) of Brazil to facilitate coordinated funding of up to two US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research projects. These projects can focus on any topic that falls within the scope of this Dimensions of Biodiversity solicitation and the corresponding FAPESP- BIOTA call for proposals published at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.fapesp.br/biota/dimensions-NSF2016">http://www.fapesp.br/biota/dimensions-NSF2016</a>. These projects must have a 5-year duration and should take advantage of the unique and innovative opportunities offered by an international collaboration.</p>
          <p>S&atilde;o Paulo state researchers applying to FAPESP under this heading must meet FAPESP eligibility requirements and must apply through an institution eligible to receive FAPESP funding.

          <p>For US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research Projects, proposals will be shared with FAPESP during the review process. NSF will solicit suggestions for appropriate external reviewers from FAPESP, but will independently manage the review of proposals in accordance with NSF policies and procedures. Reviews will be shared with FAPESP, but reviewer names will be redacted. Coordinated support will be arranged for successful proposals by the participating organizations with NSF funding the US participants and FAPESP funding S&atilde;o Paulo participants through each agency's standard award process.</p>
          <p><strong>Collection and Transfer of Samples </strong></p>
          <p>Plans to collect and transfer samples should be approved by the appropriate government authorities. Arrangements for the use of traditional knowledge or the collection of samples from the lands of local peoples should be based upon full disclosure and informed consent of those peoples. Under best practices, such arrangements develop as a partnership with early and ongoing full participation of community representatives in project design. If cooperating indigenous groups, on the basis of religious or other concerns, object to specific uses, widespread dissemination or other treatments of the knowledge or resources they provide, these concerns should be respected. Any dissemination of samples or data that were collected in a foreign country, or dissemination of results based on samples or data collected in a foreign country, should be done with the full knowledge and consent of collaborators in that country, and under any agreements that exist with government agencies in that country.</p></ol>

Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions.</p>
        <p>The following instructions supplement the guidance in the NSF PAPPG or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide.</p>
        <p>For US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research Projects, an identical scientific research project description must be submitted to NSF, by the US researcher and to FAPESP by his/her SP collaborator(s).</p>
        <p><strong>Proposal Title:</strong> Titles of proposals submitted to the Dimensions of Biodiversity program should begin with "Dimensions: " followed by the substantive title. Titles of US-China Collaborative Research proposals should begin with "Dimensions US-China: " followed by the substantive title. Titles of US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research proposals should begin with "Dimensions US-BIOTA-S&atilde;o Paulo: " followed by the substantive title.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Summary &ndash; Research proposals:</strong> The one-page Project Summary must separately address Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Integration. Descriptions of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts must be entered into the appropriate text boxes if the proposal is created in FastLane. <strong>As part of the Overview text box, explicitly summarize how the project integrates the three dimensions of biodiversity as defined in this solicitation.</strong> Grants.gov has revised instructions for completion of the summary. Although there are not separate text boxes, the information described above must be included. <strong>Proposals that do not address all three of the required dimensions of biodiversity in the Project Summary will be returned without review</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Description</strong> (max 15 pages): For all proposals, the project description must include:</p>
        <ul>
       <li> A description of how the project integrates the three dimensions of biodiversity, as defined in this solicitation.</li>
        <li>Details about why the work represents an innovative approach to biodiversity research.</li>
        <li>Information about how the work will rapidly increase understanding of biodiversity.</li>
  <li> Identification of the substantial gap(s) in biodiversity knowledge that will be filled by the proposed research.</li>
        <li> Results from Prior NSF Support: Follow the standard NSF format, as described in the PAPPG</li></ul>
        <p>Please note that per guidance in the PAPPG, the Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled "Broader Impacts." This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. PIs can decide where to include this section within the Project Description.</p>
        <p><strong>Biographical Sketches</strong> (<em>up to two pages each</em>): Biographical sketches following the standard NSF format, as described in the PAPPG should be submitted for all PIs, co-PIs, and Senior Personnel.</p>
        <p><strong>Budget:</strong> Proposals Requiring Research Facilities: Budgets should include all costs charged to the project for platforms and facilities supporting the proposed research, except those facilities separately supported by NSF (e.g. research aircraft or field equipment). Research involving polar regions should follow established guidelines for requesting logistical assets, as discussed in the relevant proposal solicitations (for Antarctic Sciences, see NSF 16-541; for Arctic Sciences, see NSF 16-595). Principal investigators are responsible for filing the appropriate requests for major research platforms; a copy of the request must be attached as an appendix to the proposal.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Information and Supplementary Documentation:</strong> Provide information such as letters of collaboration, foreign counterpart agency letters of commitment, collecting permits, environmental impact statement, and other allowed items as noted in the current issuance of the PAPPG. Include letters of commitment and other materials (such as the vertebrate animal care certificate, if applicable, or Memoranda of Understanding with existing collections for maintenance and archiving voucher specimens and digitized images). For Grants.gov users, supplementary documents should be attached in Field 12 of the R&amp;R Other Project Information Form.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplementary Document - Student Training Plan: </strong><em>(up to two pages, if applicable)</em><strong>:  </strong>Building a diverse, interdisciplinary, globally engaged, scientific workforce capable of transforming and communicating our understanding of biodiversity on Earth is one of the major activities of the Dimensions of Biodiversity Program. The future of biodiversity science is highly interdisciplinary and as such, Dimensions proposals require student training in broad research competencies including areas such as ecology, evolution, genetics, phylogenetics, bioinformatics, data management and modeling. Training should promote intellectual and methodological cross-fertilization and encourage a systems/integrative perspective towards understanding biodiversity.</p>
        <p>Each proposal that requests funding to support undergraduate and/or graduate students must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the training activities that will be provided for such individuals. The goal of the Training Plan is to prepare students to develop broad hypotheses and to become well versed with all aspects of inter-disciplinary biological research. This may be accomplished, for example, through lab rotations among PI institutions, cross-training plans, and/or integrative training workshops. NSF believes that student research experiences have their greatest impact in situations that lead the participants from a relatively dependent status to as independent status as their competence warrants. A training plan must be included that explains the approach, depth and breadth of instruction. The training plan must not exceed two pages. Proposers should describe specifically how the proposed training plan will enhance the future workforce for the field of biodiversity science and how trainees will be better able to engage in emerging research areas employing newly developing methods and tools. Only one Student Training Plan should be submitted for each project, even if it is a collaborative project. Proposals that do not comply with this requirement will be returned without review.<strong> 
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Supplementary Document &ndash; Post-Doctoral Mentoring Plan </strong><em>(one page, if applicable)</em><strong>:</strong> Each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals. The mentoring plan must not exceed one page. Only one Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan should be submitted for each project, even if it is a collaborative project. Proposals that do not comply with this requirement will not be accepted or will be returned without review.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplementary Document - Data Management Plan </strong><em>(up to two pages)</em><strong>:</strong> Each proposal must include, as a supplementary document, a data management section with the specific details of data standards, accessibility, electronic dissemination, and preservation. Of particular logistical importance (where applicable) are: plans for data collection and analysis; plans for dissemination of data and archiving; details of collaborative efforts; information about import, export and collecting permits; plans and agreements with existing collections for the distribution and long term storage of voucher specimens; plans for digitization (and sharing with iDigBio) of all voucher material along with a description of specific data standards to be implemented (e.g., Darwin Core); and information about access to resources that are not immediately under the investigator's control (e.g., museum collections, research sites, computing facilities). The data management plan must not exceed two pages. Proposals that do not comply with this requirement will not be accepted or will be returned without review.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplementary Documents - Letters of Collaboration:</strong> This section may include letters of collaboration from individuals or organizations that will play an integral role in the proposed project (e.g., individuals or organizations who will provide materials, data, or analytical capabilities). Letters of collaboration should focus solely on affirming that the individual or organization is willing to collaborate on the project as specified in the project description of the proposal. No additional text, especially elaboration of the nature of activities to be undertaken by the collaborator and endorsements of the potential value or significance of the project for the collaborator, may be included. The template that must be used for the preparation of letters of collaboration is provided below. Letters of collaboration should not be provided for any individual designated as a principal investigator or senior personnel, nor are letters of collaboration required for any organization that will be a subawardee in the proposal budget. Letters of collaboration should not be provided from data repositories where deposition of relevant data is already in scope (e.g., Genbank, Dryad, iDigBio, MorphBank, Open Tree of Life). Each letter of collaboration must be signed by the designated collaborator. The PI should request letters of collaboration well in advance of the proposal submission deadline, because they must be included at the time of the proposal submission. Letters deviating from this template will not be accepted and may be grounds for returning the proposal without review.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
     
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>For research proposals, reviewers will also be asked to evaluate whether the proposal defines a bold agenda that will use innovative approaches to integrate examination of the three dimensions of biodiversity as defined in this document. Strong plans for integration of the information and results from the project with other data should be clearly detailed in the proposal.</p>
        <p>US-China and US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research Projects will also be reviewed with respect to the extent to which they demonstrate substantial collaboration between the US and China or US and S&atilde;o Paulo partners and enhance research on the dimensions of biodiversity. The most competitive projects will be those in which the international collaboration brings substantial additional value to the project.</p>
        <p>For all proposals involving international collaborations, reviewers will consider: mutual benefits, true intellectual collaboration with the foreign partner(s), benefits to be realized from the expertise and specialized skills, facilities, sites and/or resources of the international counterpart, and active research engagement of U.S. students and early-career researchers.</p>

        <h4> 
         B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
   
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>For US-S&atilde;o Paulo Collaborative Research projects, FAPESP awardees are subject to FAPESP reporting and administration requirements as appropriate and outlined in the FAPESP Dimensions of Biodiversity/NSF-Biota/FAPESP Call for Proposals at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.fapesp.br/biota/dimensions-NSF2016">http://www.fapesp.br/biota/dimensions-NSF2016</a>. Annual and final reports of projects awarded by NSF and FAPESP should describe activities of the entire collaborative effort.</p>
        <p>As a condition of funding, any digitized data and/or digital media (e.g., images, audio files) of voucher material from this project must be made available through the online National Resource for Digitized Collections (iDigBio.org), located at the University of Florida and funded by the ADBC program at NSF.</p>
        <p>Also as a condition of funding, any phylogenetic character matrices and trees must be formatted and deposited for inclusion within the Open Tree of Life, funded by the AVAToL program at NSF (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing">http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing</a> for instructions).</p>
        <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
         <h4>
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>As a requirement of the Dimensions of Biodiversity program: 1) any digitized data and/or digital media (e.g., images, audio files) of voucher material must be made available through the online National Resource for Digitized Collections (iDigBio.org), located at the University of Florida, and 2) any phylogenetic character matrices and trees must be formatted for inclusion within the Open Tree of Life (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing">http://purl.org/opentree/data-sharing</a> for instructions). Consequently, PIs must include statements in annual and final reports indicating that their project data are being prepared according to these standards for integration or, in the case of voucher material, any media and/or digitized data are now part of the national resource and the physical specimens are part of a permanent natural history collection.</p>

        <p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism.

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
