        The following Questions and Answers have been prepared to assist proposers
          responding to the U.S. Science Support Program Associated with the
          Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (USSSP-IODP) Program Solicitation
          (NSF 03-586). [See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2003/nsf03586/nsf03586.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2003/nsf03586/nsf03586.htm</a>.]</p>
      <ol>
        <li>          <strong>        	  Q.	Is the anticipated funding level of $15M a target or a limit?</strong>          
          <p><strong>A</strong>.	The $15M amount given in the Solicitation is a limit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          <strong>Q.
                What is the expected start date of the Cooperative Agreement with the
        successful awardee? </strong>          
          <p><strong>A.</strong> Given the November 3, 2003 proposal deadline and
                the length of the anticipated NSF review process, start dates could be
                in winter or spring
                  of 2004. Events
            prior to the award include review, selection, negotiation of the Cooperative
            Agreement, and approval of the Program Plan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          <strong>Q. How many Legs of nonriser
                  drilling should be proposed in the FY 04-06 period and how
        should these be distributed among the three years?</strong>
          <p><strong> A.</strong> The exact number is still uncertain; however, with
                  new developments, these numbers should become clearer year to year. Proposers
                  may conservatively
                    assume a total of 12 Legs of non-riser drilling, distributed in a logical
              manner given available information and constraints.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          <strong> Q.	How many
        US participants should be considered per cruise per platform?</strong>
          <p><strong> A.</strong> Six to ten, as appropriate for each platform, and
            given that the US and Japan will be equal partners.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          <strong>Q. Does NSF envision
                      any significant changes in the extent of post
                      cruise science and publication activ</strong><strong>ities
                      or with the responsibilities of the Project/Program Director
        in the new Program?</strong> <strong></strong>
        <p><strong>A</strong>. Although the details have not all been worked out, the NSF does
                      not envision the need for significant changes to existing models.        
        </p>
        <p> <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences
          (GEO/OCE) has an Ocean Drilling Program that funds activities related
        to ocean drilling. In an attempt
                      to lessen confusion between NSF's own Ocean Drilling Program,
        and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, the current USSSP-IODP solicitation
                      uses the word &quot;project&quot; [rather than &quot;program&quot;] in
                      connection with the Awardee. Other than that, the words &quot;project&quot; and &quot;project
                      director&quot; in the current solicitation are comparable to the words &quot;program&quot; and &quot;program
          director&quot; in the previous solicitation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Q. Should proposers consider mission-specific platform
                        expeditions and expeditions on the riser vessel <em>Chikyu</em> in
                        the first three years of
        IODP and, if so, how many?</strong>
          <p><strong> A.</strong> Proposers are encouraged to consider such missions to the extent that they
      seem justified based on available knowledge and information.</p>
