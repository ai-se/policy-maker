                        <p>In FY 2007, NSF will invest in leading edge, frontier research on sensors and other areas, including social and behavioral sciences, that are potentially relevant to the prediction and detection of explosives and related threats.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Recent advances in sensor research have yielded innovative applications that have been of tremendous value to our national security, healthcare, environmental safety, and energy resource management.&nbsp; Additional frontier research in areas critical to our nation will yield similar advances. This is particularly true for the detection of explosives and related threats, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs).</p>
                        <p>This is an NSF-wide effort, in coordination with the efforts of other agencies, which seeks to advance fundamental knowledge in new technologies for sensors and sensor networks, and in the use of sensor data in control and decision making, particularly in relation to the prediction and detection of explosives and related threats.&nbsp; NSF investments will coordinate with and leverage on research currently underway in other areas of the federal government. The Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, and others each support active research into predicting and detecting explosive devices, including IEDs.&nbsp; By integrating research in the field, effective technologies and systems to counter such threats can best be implemented.&nbsp; This research is seen as critical to our nation's ability to deploy effective homeland security measures, and to protect civilians and our military forces throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Research Related to Prediction</strong></p>
                        <p>New fundamental research into the scientific and engineering principles of prediction will enable the recognition of explosives and other threats earlier than current technologies allow. The ultimate goal is to identify and isolate a threat at or before the point of device assembly and placement. Research toward this goal might include mathematical, behavioral, and cognitive modeling, including algorithms and sensor systems that may predict the possible assembly and placement of explosive devices.&nbsp; This may involve the recognition of emplacement patterns, behavioral pattern recognition from video and other innovative sensing systems, human intelligence and social network analysis of terrorist networks, analysis of communications, and knowledge-management systems.</p>
                        <p>The key to prediction will be the ability to develop novel models and theoretical frameworks and to integrate data from diverse sources, which may include sensor information, psychology and sociology of terrorists, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and information management &#150; areas in which NSF has long been active.</p>
                        <p>Specific topics of research may include the 1) recruitment and indoctrination of potential bombers, the detection of preparatory activities related to the planning and construction phases of bombings; 2) the detection of suspicious behaviors presaging imminent attacks, mathematical modeling of dynamic hybrid systems that include physical systems and human behavior; 3) new sensors and sensor networks that will quickly detect and predict the assembly and placement of explosive devices; 4) fully reconfigurable mechatronic stationary and mobile devices that will optimize in real-time the probability of tracking suspicious devices, substances or people; and 5) the enhanced use of available signal, image, and sensor data in decision-making and planning processes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Research Related to Detection</strong></p>
                        <p>The sensitivity and fine resolution of sensors often determine what can be detected, at what location, and how quickly. This is particularly important for the detection of explosive devices, since the earlier a threat can be identified, the easier it is to address.</p>
                        <p>Once an explosive device is in place, its detection will rely on scientific and engineering concepts that permit rapid, standoff identification and localization of explosives. This research includes the remote surveillance and possible identification of an explosive&#146;s unique characteristics. The purpose is to distinguish real threats in an environment, with minimal to no false alarms. Topics in this category include sensor technologies, signal processing, data fusion, and autonomous system technologies.</p>
                        <p>Specific areas of research may include the development of new detectors based on a fundamental understanding of biosensor systems with an emphasis on new biorecognition principles that extend beyond currently employed schemes involving antibody-antigen interactions. An example is an &#147;electronic nose&#148; modeled after the olfactory response in mammals such as dogs. Additional research may go toward the development of new detectors that can identify specific chemical signatures. These may be based on new spectroscopic, electrochemical and mass spectrometry methods. Other areas of research include self powered wireless networks of mobile platforms with enhanced sensing capabilities, such as those mimicking the five human senses, for accurate detection.</p>
                        <p>More broadly, miniaturization of chemical analyzers is needed. Nanostructured materials like single-walled nanotubes, nanowires, magnetic nanoparticles and luminescent semiconductor quantum dots are especially promising in the miniaturization of electronics and photonics; research is needed on the synthesis and characterization of chemical and electronic materials such as these. Also, in order to maintain active sensors in the field, small reliable power sources are required, including sources capable of long-term unattended operation and/or energy extraction from the local environment.</p>
                        <p>Complementing this sensor research would be advances in tagging and tracing explosives to aid in forensic investigations. There are limited chemical approaches available now because of the difficulty of effectively hiding this information while not interfering with the other chemical and physical properties of the material.</p>
                        <p>Detection capabilities can be enhanced by the development of novel multi-functional smart materials and smart structures with embedded sensing, actuation, morphing, self-healing, reconfiguration and camouflaging capabilities.&nbsp; These advances will lead to new capabilities that will be complemented by distributed data analysis similar to biological brain and nerve systems.</p>
                        <p>Additional perspective is provided in the 2004 report of the National Research Council of the National Academies entitled "Existing and Potential Standoff Explosives Detection Techniques" (<a href="http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/10998.html">http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/10998.html</a>).</p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Under the broad categories of prediction and detection, examples of possible topics that build on previous NSF-supported research include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Science and </strong><strong>Engineering of Materials, Concepts, and Designs for New Sensors and Sensing Systems.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposed research should have the potential to lead to sensors that are sensitive, selective, and stable with rapid response times.&nbsp; A
    unifying theme is to stimulate fundamental advances for in situ and remote
    sensing systems with a goal toward observing, modeling and analyzing a wide
    range of complex materials, compounds, life forms, and processes. Proposed
    research should leverage recent advances in microelectronics, photonics,
    telemetry, robotics, wireless communication, sensor networks, and other methods
    for highly resolved spatial and temporal sensing.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Techniques from nuclear science, such as those using neutrons or gamma rays,
    can also be used for the detection of conventional explosives.&nbsp; The
    development of new detection technologies may be applicable both to basic
    science and to security requirements, and existing technologies may be made
    exportable from basic science use to robust field-based implementation. </p>
  <p>Specific topics of research may include real-time investigation of the detonation process and mechanisms to initiate detonation in explosives. This research will enhance our capabilities in efficient detection, sensing, and control of explosive devices.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Science and </strong><strong>Engineering Applications of Networked
        Sensors; Interpretation of Data; Responsive Action.</strong> This
      area addresses system-level application areas.&nbsp; Research issues include:&nbsp; 1)
      decision and control theory for sensed information, 2) sampling, pattern
      recognition and false alarms in sensed data and 3) research that incorporates
      uncertainty and risk into decision making for use with imperfectly sensed
      data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Information Management of Sensing Systems.</strong> In the area
      of information management, basic research is needed on innovative approaches
      to tagging data to facilitate subsequent retrieval, and on compression
      algorithms useful for transmitting large data files, such as high resolution
      image files. Innovative new signal processing techniques and algorithms,
      together with test bed experiments, are needed for feature extraction of
      anomalies associated with explosives and related activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Social and Behavioral Science of Prediction.</strong>&nbsp; It is increasingly clear that explosives and related threats defy a completely technical solution.&nbsp; Research
      findings from psychologists, sociologists, cultural anthropologists, geographers
      and others can enhance our ability to respond, either through enhanced understanding
      of the threat leading to better prediction, or through enhanced understanding
      and usage of sensor data leading to better detection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Research on prediction and detection of biological, toxic chemical, and nuclear weapons is excluded from the scope of this solicitation.</strong></p>
  <p>This NSF-wide research program encourages PI's to consider the development
    of education programs for the training of graduate and undergraduate students
    in this important area.&nbsp; A unique opportunity exists for collaboration to develop interdisciplinary courses with a view toward the establishment of a comprehensive framework for addressing the prediction and detection of explosives and related threats (e.g., social science and engineering).&nbsp; Also encouraged are innovative approaches that provide students with substantial opportunities to gain deeper knowledge and expertise in this area.&nbsp; This program seeks to integrate research and education, which is a key strategy that NSF supports and promotes.&nbsp;Proposals with an international dimension are welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>TYPES OF SUPPORT</p>
  <p>Projects funded under this solicitation will support research activities
    of the following types:&nbsp; 1) Explosives and Related Threats Small Award
    (EXP-SA) and 2) Explosives and Related Threats Large Award (EXP-LA):&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p> Explosives and Related Threats Small Award (EXP-SA) proposals should
        involve innovative and high-risk research, with potential for high impact.&nbsp; The
        requested budget may be for up to an all-inclusive total, including both
        direct and indirect costs, of $400,000, over a duration not to exceed
        three years.</p>
    </li>
    <li> Explosives and Related Threats Large Award (EXP-LA) proposals
        must involve fundamental contributions in research, with the potential
        to be innovative and transformative, by two or more investigators from
        different disciplines (e.g., engineering and social science; chemistry
        and biology; computer science and geoscience; etc.).&nbsp; EXP-LA proposals should generate new concepts and approaches that are enabled by the synergistic interaction of diverse fields.&nbsp; The PI and up to four co-PI's must be listed on the cover page of the proposal, and have the diverse skills necessary to pursue the research objectives.&nbsp; The
        requested budget may be for up to an all-inclusive total, including both
        direct and indirect costs, of $800,000, over a duration not to exceed
        three years.&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A grantees conference at NSF (Arlington, Virginia) at the end of the first
      year will enable the principal investigators of grants awarded through
      this solicitation to review progress, exchange information, and promote
      collaborations.&nbsp; At least one investigator from each funded grant will be required to participate.&nbsp; Funds
      should be included in the proposal budget for attendance at this conference.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>

<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
    within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the
    proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the
    reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does
    the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How
    well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient
    access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for
    research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and
    partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific
    and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed
    activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
    -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF
    is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>Clear and compelling explanation of the cutting edge nature of the proposed research and its potential for the prediction and/or detection of explosives or related threats.</p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed
  by&nbsp;<span>Adhoc Review or Panel Review</span>.		</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or
  decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's
  review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
  by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
  Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent
  to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In
  addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award
  or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available
  through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project
  reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
  project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other
  specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter
  information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
  using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes
  certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>IX. OTHER INFORMATION</h3><p>The NSF Website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this Website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, MyNSF (formerly the Custom News Service)is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF Regional Grants Conferences. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests.  MyNSF also is available on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/mynsf/">https://www.nsf.gov/mynsf/</a>.</p>

<p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal
  government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed
  via this new mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov may be obtained at <a href="http://www.grants.gov">http://www.grants.gov</a>.</p><blockquote>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
  under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended.
  The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection
  of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used
  for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress.
  The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff
  assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees
  to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
  or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers
  and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other
  government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants
  or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate
  programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court
  or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information
  about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to
  select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee
  members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal
  File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004),
  and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69
  Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary.
  Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility
  of receiving an award.</p>
<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
