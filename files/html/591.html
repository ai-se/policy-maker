<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>
<p>A revised version of the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em>
(PAPPG), <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a>, was
issued on October 1, 2010 and is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 18,
2011. Please be advised that the guidelines contained in <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf11001">NSF 11-1</a> apply to proposals
submitted in response to this funding opportunity. </p><p><strong>Cost Sharing: </strong>The PAPPG
has been revised to implement the National Science Board's recommendations regarding cost sharing.
Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. In order to assess the scope of the
project, all organizational resources necessary for the project must be described in the Facilities,
Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal. The description should be narrative in nature
and must not include any quantifiable financial information. Mandatory cost sharing will only be
required when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director. See the PAPP Guide Part I: <em>Grant
Proposal Guide (GPG) </em><a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2gxi">Chapter
II.C.2.g(xi)</a> for further information about the implementation of these
recommendations.</p><p><strong>Data Management Plan: </strong>The PAPPG contains a clarification of
NSF's long standing data policy. All proposals must describe plans for data management and sharing
of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. FastLane will not
permit submission of a proposal that is missing a Data Management Plan. The Data Management Plan
will be reviewed as part of the intellectual merit or broader impacts of the proposal, or both, as
appropriate. Links to data management requirements and plans relevant to specific Directorates,
Offices, Divisions, Programs, or other NSF units are available on the NSF website at: <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a>.
See <br /><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter
II.C.2.j</a> of the GPG for further information about the implementation of this
requirement.</p><p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: </strong>As a reminder, each
proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary
document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.
Please be advised that if required, FastLane will not permit submission of a proposal that is
missing a Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan. See <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Chapter II.C.2.j</a> of
the GPG for further information about the implementation of this requirement.</p></p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Historically, the fields of cancer biology and clinical oncology have been dominated by
researchers with classical training in the basic and clinical life sciences. More recently,
the field has expanded to include physical and engineering scientists, whose background and
expertise are complementary to those possessed by life scientists, leading to the recognition that
significant advancements in the fundamental understanding of cancer diseases are possible through
multidisciplinary research that involves experts in the physical and engineering science
disciplines. Emerging and burgeoning opportunities for collaborative research at the
intersection of the physical/engineering sciences and the life sciences have been identified through
several NSF workshops over the past few years, including "<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://mechse.illinois.edu/conferences/CellAsMachine/">The Cell as a Machine</a>" (NSF award
0803692) and "Cell and Molecular Biomechanics" (NSF award 0834046); in addition, this topic was the
focus of a well attended and highly participatory session at the <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.cmmigranteeconference.org/2009CMMI/docs/2009%20NSF%20CMMI%20Agenda.pdf">Grantees
Conference</a> held by the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) in
June of 2009. Similarly, in October of 2009, the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Office of
Physical Sciences-Oncology (OPSO) launched its network of 12 <a
href="http://physics.cancer.gov/news/announcements.asp">Physical Sciences - Oncology Centers</a>
(PS-OCs). In addition, the National Academies has conducted and published similar studies,
including "<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12809">Research at the Intersection
of the Physical and Life Sciences</a>," "<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12764">A
New Biology for the 21st Century</a>," and "<a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12159">Inspired by Biology: From Molecules to
Materials to Machines</a>." </p><p>Continued investments in inter- and multi-disciplinary research
at the intersection of the engineering and physical sciences and the life sciences that focus on
elucidating the cause and origin of cancer cell formation may lead to significant scientific and
societal impacts. Advancing the fundamental understanding of cancer biology and clinical
oncology to underpin translational research can promote the prevention, detection, and treatment of
cancer diseases. There are many opportunities, therefore, to apply perspectives from physical
and engineering sciences to advance the understanding of cancer processes (<em>e.g.</em> initiation
and progression, invasion and metastasis, heterogeneity or resistance, <em>etc</em>.) at various
temporal and/or spatial scales. </p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Significant advances may be expected as the result of continued investments in inter- and
multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of the physical/engineering and life sciences that
focus on unraveling the cause and origin of cancer cell formation. Advancing the fundamental
understanding of cancer biology and clinical oncology to underpin translational research can promote
the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer diseases. Researchers have the opportunity
to submit proposals to advance the understanding of cancer processes (<em>e.g.</em> initiation and
progression, invasion and metastasis, heterogeneity or resistance, <em>etc</em>.) at various
temporal and/or spatial scales with perspectives from physical sciences and engineering.<br /><br
/>Considering these opportunities and areas of needed knowledge, competitive proposals submitted in
response to this announcement should (1) develop novel non-traditional physical and engineering
sciences based approaches, materials, or platforms to understand and/or control cancer; (2)
generate unique sets of physical measurements that can provide insight into molecular mechanisms of
oncogenesis, metastasis, drug resistance or other aspects of cancer that could eventually lead to
more effective disease treatment; (3) develop and evaluate theoretical approaches (using simulation
or control theory, for example) to provide a comprehensive and dynamic understanding of
cancer.</p><p>Researchers are encouraged to contact the most relevant research program director
listed in this announcement to ensure that their proposed research fits within the scope of the NSF
program to which submission is planned. </p><p>Please be aware that NSF as part of its partnership
with NCI will share proposals with officials from this partner agency. NCI's Office of
Physical Sciences-Oncology (OPSO) refers to this collaborative interagency agreement as PLIER,

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed
if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a
scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten
other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal.
These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process.
Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to
review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may
serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion.
Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no
conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4><p>All NSF
proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review
criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances,
however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of
certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below.
The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and
not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria,
reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being
considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is the
intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />How important is the proposed activity to
advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well
qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer
will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest
and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and
organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p><p><strong>What are
the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />How well does the activity advance
discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the
proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity,
disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and
education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be
disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits
of the proposed activity to society? </p></blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to
demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p><p>Mentoring
activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page
supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion.</p>

<a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding
decisions:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />One of the
principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education
through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.
These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume
responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts
that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
learning perspectives.</p><p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and
Activities</strong></em><br />Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all
citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is
essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle
of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and
supports.</p></blockquote>

<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program announcement will be reviewed by Ad
hoc Review and/or Panel Review.
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal.
The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers
and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the
NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be
declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their
proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins
on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when
the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In
all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the
names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program
Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or
decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for
funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business,
financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement.
Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations
or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF
should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal
Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant
or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own
risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in
the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as
promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of
reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal
Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable
to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by
categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific
approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award
letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research
Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by
reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF
Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable
Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and
Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p><p>*These
documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.
Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by
e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p><p>More comprehensive
information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF
awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available
electronically on the NSF Website at <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal
Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days
before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project
reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final
project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the
required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report will delay NSF review
and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs
should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required
data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through
FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports
provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and
organizational), publications, and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be
required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
using the electronic system. Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification
by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report
must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared
specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted
on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National
Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF
is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and
welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and
engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering.
It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities,
K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations
throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic
institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for
research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition,
the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The
agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities,
certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also
supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international
scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic
level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide
funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on
NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding
preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device
for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals
with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or
general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800)
877-8339.</p><p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703)

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority
of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will
be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by
awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to
Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as
part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data
regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to
government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete
assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding
applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate
programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal
administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers
or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>,

&quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004).
Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information,
however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information
collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB
control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of
information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing
instructions. Send comments regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
