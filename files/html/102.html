          IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Scalable Nanomanufacturing for Integrated Systems (SNM-IS) solicitation is changed from the previous Scalable Nanomanufacturing (SNM) solicitation in that the objective has shifted from research in large-scale manufacturing of single-component nanomaterials and nanostructures to investigations in scalable nanomanufacturing and integration of multi-component nano-enabled integrated systems. The emphasis is to frame proposals in the context of the realization of integrated systems for the eventual economic manufacture of demonstrably useful nano-enabled products in high volume or customized products in low volume, responsibly and safely. An integrated system is a system that combines different functions together to work as one entity. System integration is the process of assembling component subsystems such that the subsystems function together as a system.</p>
          
          <p>Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16001">NSF 16-1</a>), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 25, 2016. Please be advised that proposers who opt to submit prior to January 25, 2016, must also follow the guidelines contained in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16001">NSF 16-1</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) announces a 7<sup>th</sup> (seventh) year of a solicitation on collaborative research and education in the area of Scalable Nanomanufacturing for Integrated Systems (SNM-IS). This solicitation is in response to and is a component of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) Signature Initiative: Sustainable Nanomanufacturing - Creating the Industries of the Future (<a href="http://www.nano.gov/NSINanomanufacturing">http://www.nano.gov/NSINanomanufacturing</a>).</p>
            <p>Many nanofabrication techniques have demonstrated the ability to synthesize small quantities of nanomaterials and nanostructures for characterization and evaluation and simple nanodevices for analysis and testing purposes. The emphasis of the Scalable Nanomanufacturing for Integrated Systems (SNM-IS) solicitation is on research in new nano-scale manufacturing concepts and integration methods to realize complex integrated systems based on nanotechnology. The research will focus on overcoming the key scientific and engineering barriers that prevent the translation of laboratory-scale discoveries in nano-enabled integrated systems to an industrially relevant scale, reliably, affordably and within sustainability and environmental, health and safety (EHS) guidelines. The goal of the SNM-IS solicitation is to study and formulate the fundamental principles of scalable nanomanufacturing and integration for nanotechnology-based integrated systems towards the eventual manufacture of useful nano-enabled products.</p>
            <p>The SNM-IS solicitation is driven by the discovery of numerous new nanomaterials with unique properties (2D atomic layer, transition metal dichalcogenides, van der Waals heterostructures, perovskites, metal-organic frameworks, metamaterials, origami, etc.) in recent years and invention of many novel fabrication methods (nano additive manufacturing, strain engineering processing, bio-nanomanufacturing, etc.) to synthesize nanostructures with different geometries, 'microstructures' and functionalities. These nanomaterials and nanostructures need to be assembled into larger-scale components and devices, which, in turn, need to be integrated into higher-order subsystems and systems so novel and useful products can be made for a variety of applications in the areas of functional and structural materials, mechanics, optics, electronics, chemical, biomedical, catalysis, environmental, energy, sensing, security, defense, etc. Integration will need to be across material sets (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, hierarchical nanoparticles, etc.), across length-scales (molecular to nano to micro to meso to macro), and across function (mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical, biological, thermal, etc.) and across processes (top-down, bottom-up). Integration will involve the study and implementation of hybrid manufacturing and assembly processes and methods. The research will be driven by the need to understand and establish, among others, design rules for integrated systems, manufacturing and integration process and control models, and measurement science and technology. The desired outcome will be a nano-enabled integrated system that combines many different functions together to work as one entity and that is made up of component subsystems that are designed to perform in a unified manner.</p>
            <p><strong>The SNM-IS solicitation seeks proposals that investigate novel scalable nanomanufacturing and integration methods for nano-enabled integrated systems with a clear commercial relevance. Proposals should consider addressing key aspects of the nanomanufacturing value chain comprised of nano-scale building-blocks </strong><strong>&rarr;</strong><strong> complex nanomaterials and  nanostructures </strong>&rarr;<strong> functional components and devices </strong>&rarr;<strong> integrated sub-systems and systems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
          <li><strong>Novel nanomanufacturing processes and integration strategies for large-area or continuous manufacturing or customized manufacturing of nano-scale materials and structures and their assembly into larger-scale components and devices and the integration of the components and devices into higher order structures, subsystems and systems;</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Fundamental scientific research in key, well-defined technical areas that are compellingly justified as approaches to overcome critical scientific and engineering barriers to nanomanufacturing scale-up, customized nanomanufacturing and multi-scale integration; and</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Design principles for production systems leading to nanomanufacturing tools, and platforms; identification of manipulation and control methodologies, and metrology, instrumentation, and standards needed for process monitoring and control and to assess quality and yield; determination of process models and simulations to guide processing and integration; identification of environmental and energy footprints, as applicable. </strong></li></ul>
            <p>Competitive proposals will incorporate the following three elements in their research plans:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>A persuasive case that the nano-enabled integrated system to be manufactured has or is likely to have sufficient demand to justify eventual scale-up or meet demands for low-volume specialty materials or device systems;</li>
              <li>A clearly identified set of research challenges requiring science and engineering solutions that must be addressed to enable the realization of integrated systems for the cost-effective manufacture of high quality nano-enabled products in large quantities or low-volume specialty products; and</li>
              <li>A compelling research plan with clear objectives and approaches to overcome the identified research challenges. This may include environmentally benign approaches and life-cycle considerations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These elements should be carefully explained and justified in proposals, since both the scientific novelty and the feasibility of the methods being researched will be important evaluation factors.</p>
            <p><strong>The SNM-IS solicitation is NOT seeking research proposals in large-scale manufacturing of single component nanomaterials and nanostructures. Novel ideas in novel nanomanufacturing processes and scale-up may be sent to the core Nanomanufacturing (NM) Program.</strong></p>
            <p>Competitive proposals are expected to address the training and education of students in nanomanufacturing, system integration and related areas. Since Scalable Nanomanufacturing for Integrated Systems research will involve addressing multiple scientific and engineering challenges in the design and manufacture of complex nano-enabled integrated systems, an inter-disciplinary approach is strongly encouraged. Disciplines could range from the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and others) to engineering (materials, mechanical, electrical, chemical, biomedical, industrial and others) and could include mathematics and computer science. While not required, collaborative activities with industrial or small business companies (e.g., through the GOALI program) are welcome and collaborations in which industrial partners develop industrially relevant test-beds where university and company researchers can experiment and interact are encouraged. It is advisable that such firms be consulted early in the proposal preparation process and that their intellectual contributions be clearly explained in the proposal.</p>
            <p>Other research and education projects in nanoscale science and engineering will continue to be supported in the appropriate programs and divisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Please see requirements for submitting proposals for collaborations; a single proposal with sub-contracts must be submitted for collaborations and the submission of separate proposals from multiple investigators for collaborative projects ('collaborative proposals') is not allowed.</strong></p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>A length of one nanometer (one billionth of a meter) approximately defines both the minimum feature size of the smallest human-made structures and the dimension of small molecules from which living things are assembled. Nanoscale materials and structures are designed to have novel physical and chemical properties that derive from their intermediate scale, where unique properties between atomic and bulk behaviors can be accessed and controlled. While many potentially technologically interesting nanomaterials and nanostructures have been identified, these often have been produced using slow and expensive methods with little potential for economical production at commercial scale. The assembly of nanomaterials and nanostructures into components and devices is usually done batch-wise, which further reduces the speed of production. However, progress has been made in component assembly using continuous and other high-throughput processes. One area where significant advances are needed is in multi-scale integration of nanostructures, nanocomponents and nanodevices into subsystems and systems. There is a need for economical methods for making nano-enabled integrated systems. These may be created by combining various manufacturing and assembly techniques, including but not limited to combinations of molecular, self- and directed-assembly and top-down miniaturization, bio-assembly, networking at the nanoscale and multi-scale and hierarchical architectures, robotics on surfaces, nanomodular materials and systems by design, chemo-mechanical processing of molecular assemblies, and quantum interactions. These are just a few examples of processes among many others that may be studied towards the realization of nano-enabled integrated systems. Research may also be directed to the study of processes for the realization of specialty, customized integrated systems, which are necessarily low-volume. Another challenge to consider is economical nanomanufacturing and integration with zero or near zero waste production.</p>

         <h3>
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The SNM-IS solicitation is seeking high-risk/high-reward research and education proposals. Its focus is on challenges in scalable nanomanufacturing for integrated systems and societal and educational issues associated with continuing advances in the nanomanufacturing research field and the ensuing increasing use of nanoscale materials, devices and systems. <strong>All proposals should clearly state what technical roadblocks to integration and scale-up exist and what new approach or approaches will be investigated to overcome those roadblocks. The scientific and engineering barriers to commercialization, in terms of production rate, throughput, quality, reproducibility, yield, efficiency, sustainability, mass customization and cost should be addressed in the proposal.</strong></p>
          <p>In preparation of the proposal, the research team should consider one (or more) of the following elements of Scalable Nanomanufacturing for Integrated Systems:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong><em>Novel nanomanufacturing processes and integration strategies for large-area or continuous manufacturing or customized manufacturing of nano-scale materials and structures and their assembly into larger-scale components and devices and the integration of the components and devices into higher order structures, subsystems and systems.</em></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Processes could be top-down (deposition, lithography) or bottom-up (directed- and self-assembly) or a combination of the two. Deposition processes could be vapor- or solution-based or any other. Lithography processes could be tip-, directed energy-, print- or imprint-based or any other. Assembly processes could be spontaneous or directed via physical, electrostatic, magnetic, acoustic, chemical, biological, thermal or any other means. Research on creating nanostructures that can be easily assembled into large-scale nanosystems and systems of such nanosystems is sought. It is anticipated that such systems will comprise of discrete elements that are differentiable in composition, structure, dimension, and/or geometry. It is further anticipated that such desired integrated systems could be broken down into a finite number of interacting or interdependent subsystems and components with individually-defined functions. The proposed methodologies should lead to the fabrication of complex heterogeneous nanostructures and components, which are integrated into higher order devices and systems. The potential for high-volume production of industrially-relevant nano-enabled systems or low-volume production of specialized systems should be demonstrated. Research in computation, modeling and simulation, coupled with bench-scale and high throughput experimentation in support of the scale-up and integration of nanomanufacturing processes is sought. Projects identifying specific technological roadblocks and proposing academic-industry research partnerships to overcome them are particularly encouraged. These may include research efforts inspired by promising novel nanotechnologies, fabrication approaches and tools recently demonstrated in industry or academia that likely have wider applicability. Examples of such approaches include large area or multi-wafer nanofabrication, continuous reactive processing, continuous roll-to-roll processing, massively-parallel processing, layer-by-layer processing, self-organizing structuring, and other high-throughput methods as well as methods for low-volume production of customized nano-enabled integrated systems such as additive manufacturing.</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong><em>Fundamental scientific research in key, well-defined technical areas that are compellingly justified as approaches to overcome critical scientific and engineering barriers to nanomanufacturing scale-up, customized nanomanufacturing and multi-scale integration; and.</em></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Approaches for the scale-up and integration of both emergent and more well-established materials synthesis and processing methods are desired. For example, proposals that include new theoretical developments related to nanoscale materials, physics, chemistry or biology; ideas for creating mathematical models for manufacturability; experimental and computational methodologies for retaining nanoscale properties in materials and function in nano-enabled systems after scale-up or as customized systems; harnessing of interfaces across dimensional scales;  and exploration of production-scale assembly approaches for device fabrication and system integration are welcome. High production rate, throughput, quality, reproducibility and yield are all required for commercial viability. Some emerging fields of application appear to be particularly well suited for scale-up or mass customization. In more established areas, researchers should clearly state what roadblocks to scale-up and system integration exist and what new approach or approaches will be investigated to overcome these roadblocks.</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong><em>Design principles for production systems leading to nanomanufacturing tools, and platforms; identification of manipulation and control methodologies, and metrology, instrumentation, and standards needed for process monitoring and control and to assess quality and yield; determination of process models and simulations to guide processing and integration; identification of environmental and energy footprints, as applicable.</em></strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Research is encouraged on design principles, architectures and construction methods for nanoscale measurement and processing tools and platforms. Research in this area anticipates instrumentation with integrated and/or stand-alone capabilities for the nanometer-scale resolution metrology of three-dimensional objects, new tools for sensing, assembling, processing, manipulating, manufacturing and integrating across length scales, across material sets, and across functions; new sensing modalities and algorithms for controlling and testing nanostructures and devices, and design automation tools for assembling devices and systems of large numbers of heterogeneous nanocomponents. This research should be strongly grounded in fundamental understanding of nanoscale processes and system design rules, and should integrate novel concepts for measurement, high-rate synthesis and processing, multi-scale integration, and scale-up of nanoscale processing methods that derive from such understanding. Key factors in the progression to large-scale nanomanufacturing of integrated systems and low-volume manufacturing of specialized systems involve standardization and the development of measurement, control and quality monitoring methods. Towards that end, approaches are sought for reliable, high-speed, high-resolution on-line or off-line metrology, diagnostics, and adaptive (real-time) control methods and the process simulation and design methods needed in nanomanufacturing and integration.</p>
          <p>In addition, proposals should address technological, societal, educational, sustainability and outreach implications in context of the SNM-IS solicitation. NSF has a strong interest in developing the infrastructure for nanoscale science and engineering. Accordingly, all proposals should address integration of research and education, for example, by including course development appropriate to the nature of the project. Collaborations between research universities and community colleges to provide curricula and research experiences to educate the future nanomanufacturing workforce are particularly encouraged.</p>
          <p>NSF does not normally support technical assistance, pilot plant efforts, research requiring security classification, or the development of products for commercial marketing or market research for a particular project or invention. Other research and education projects in nanoscale science and engineering will continue to be supported in the relevant programs, divisions and directorates.</p>
          <p>Principal Investigators should ensure that their proposed project does not substantially overlap with ongoing federally-funded research. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation may be shared by NSF with other federal agencies, including (but not limited to) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, Environmental Protection Agency, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Army Research Office, Office of Naval Research, and the Intelligence Community. Reviews, including panel summaries, if applicable, may also be shared. The reasons for sharing these proposals and reviews include potential co-funding as well as avoiding duplication of federal funding for a particular research project. If the PI or awardee organization does not wish the proposal to be shared with a particular federal agency or agencies for funding purposes, they should provide a Single Copy Document with the proposal stating which federal funding agencies should be excluded. No explanations for exclusion are required.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
   
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>In addition, the following criteria will be used:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Potential for significant contributions to the advancement of the field of nanomanufacturing. Examples include: Novel scalable processes and techniques and integration strategies for high volume nanomanufacturing of integrated systems and manufacturing of low-volume specialty nano-enabled systems; New strategies for integration of nanomaterials and nanostructures into large-scale functional components and devices and integration of these into higher-order architectures and systems; Fundamental scientific research in well-defined technical areas that are compellingly justified as approaches to overcome critical barriers to scale-up and system integration; and/or, Design principles for production systems leading to nanomanufacturing and system integration platforms, identification of metrology, instrumentation, standards and control methodologies needed for process control and to assess quality and yield.</li>
          <li>Uniqueness and importance of the impacts of the project as they relate to nanomanufacturing and system integration. For example, the societal, environmental and economic implications of the large-scale production and specialty product manufacture and use of integrated systems; and/or the added value to nanomanufacturing education.</li>
          <li>Strength of the team and their interactions evident through planned collaborations, especially, industrial collaborations; appropriateness and likely effectiveness of those collaborations; quality of the collaborations, not on the number of collaborators; degree of inter-disciplinary synergy; and likely effectiveness of the management plan.</li>
        </ol>

          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

         <h4>
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
