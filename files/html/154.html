          <blockquote>
            <p>Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) is an NSF-wide program that supports international activities across all NSF-supported disciplines. The primary goal of PIRE is to support high quality projects in which advances in research and education could not occur without international collaboration. PIRE seeks to catalyze a higher level of international engagement in the U.S. science and engineering community.</p>
            <p>International partnerships are essential to addressing critical science and engineering problems. In the global context, U.S. researchers and educators must be able to operate effectively in teams with partners from different national environments and cultural backgrounds. PIRE promotes excellence in science and engineering through international collaboration and facilitates development of a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering workforce.</p>
            <p>This PIRE competition will be open to all areas of science and engineering research which are supported by the NSF. </p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Recognizing the value of international partnerships in addressing critical science and engineering questions, NSF established the Partnerships in International Research and Education (PIRE) program in 2005. PIRE is an NSF-wide program that supports fundamental, international research and education in physical, living, human, and engineered systems. PIRE awards enable research at the leading edge of science and engineering by facilitating partnerships with others nationally and internationally, by educating and preparing a diverse, world-class STEM workforce, and by fostering institutional capacity for international collaboration. This agenda is designed to encourage high-risk/high-reward activities and the pursuit of potentially transformative ideas.</p>
          <p>International engagement will be critical to keeping the U.S. globally competitive at the frontiers of knowledge. As science and engineering expertise and infrastructure advance across the globe, it is expected that the U.S. will increasingly benefit from international collaborations and a globally engaged workforce leading to transformational science and engineering breakthroughs. Therefore, PIRE will promote cooperation among scientists and engineers from all nations, and will fund international collaborative activities through all areas of research supported by NSF.  PIRE is also working with counterpart funding agencies to lower barriers to international collaboration for U.S scientists, engineers and students, and to encourage jointly funded, bilateral and multilateral projects.</p>
          <p>This sixth round of the PIRE competition will be open to all areas of science and engineering research which are supported by NSF (including education research). Interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.</p>
     
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p><strong>A. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Support excellence in science and engineering research and education through international collaboration.</li>
            <li>Promote opportunities where international collaboration can provide unique advantages of scope, scale, flexibility, expertise, facilities, or access to phenomena, enabling advances that could not occur otherwise.</li>
            <li>Engage and share resources and research infrastructure within and across institutions to build strong international partnerships.</li>
            <li>Create and promote opportunities for students and early career researchers to participate in substantive international research experiences.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>B. CHARACTERISTICS OF PIRE PROJECTS</strong></p>
          <p>PIRE partners share an ambitious research vision that integrates research and education. The project theme may involve any area of science and engineering research that is supported by NSF. PIRE projects may vary in size and exhibit diverse forms of organization, collaboration, and operation suited to their individual needs. PIRE projects must include collaboration with foreign research partners and international research experiences for students to promote a diverse internationally competitive science and engineering workforce.</p>
          <p>NSF is committed to the principle of diversity and expects PIRE projects to involve groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering at all levels (faculty, students and postdoctoral researchers). Underrepresented groups include women, persons with disabilities, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. Increasing the participation of a diverse U.S. citizenry by creating opportunities and enabling them to contribute is essential to the health and vitality of science, engineering, and education.</p>
          <p><strong>C. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</strong></p>
          <p>The Principal Investigator (PI) will be the director of the PIRE project. The PI is expected to provide intellectual leadership and to be an essential participant in research and related educational activities. The PI will have overall responsibility for the administration of the award, for the management of the project, and for serving as the main point of contact with NSF.</p>
          <p><strong>D. ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Proposals involving collaboration with all countries are eligible and encouraged.</strong></p>
          <p>In addition, NSF is working jointly with counterpart national and international funding organizations to enhance opportunities for collaborative activities in S&amp;E research and education between U.S. investigators and their colleagues abroad. Funding for international collaborators on PIRE projects may be available from agencies identified in the sections below. Details in the sections below describe coordinated and supplemental funding that may be available for PIRE awardees' international collaborators from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research Program (PEER Science), and from these counterpart agencies abroad:  Brazil: The Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo (FAPESP), China: the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Czech Republic: Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic (MEYS), and Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TA CR), France: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Germany: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), India: Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Ireland: Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Italy: Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN), Japan: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Korea: National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), Mexico: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a (CONACYT), Norway: Research Council of Norway (RCN), Poland: National Science Centre of Poland (NCN), Russia: Ministry of Education and Science (MES), Spain: Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), Switzerland: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), *Taiwan: the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST, Taiwan), and Turkey: Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK).</p>
          <p>*MOST Taiwan is the designated representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).</p>
          <p>For those PIRE proposals where the foreign collaborators may be eligible for these additional funding opportunities, NSF will coordinate and manage the review of proposals in consultation with the participating domestic and foreign funding organizations, according to the respective arrangements with NSF (see <strong>Collaborations with Counterpart Agencies</strong> below).<strong>  </strong>Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared between the participating organizations as appropriate, according to the respective arrangements with NSF. </p>
          <p>For more information as to what is required of the foreign collaborators or PIRE PIs in order to apply for these additional funding opportunities refer to the <strong>External Agency Partners</strong> contact information in <strong>Part VIII. Agency Contacts</strong>.  Prior to final NSF funding recommendations, PIs whose proposals are selected for PIRE awards may be asked to submit additional information, including relevant budget details, to co-funding organizations to enable completion of their co-funding decisions. Award decisions by NSF are in no way contingent upon the funding decisions of partnering agencies.</p>
          <p><strong>It is important to note that NSF&rsquo;s partnerships with the organizations listed below do not restrict applicants from submitting proposals with foreign collaborators from locations or support from agencies that are not on that list.  Proposers are free to partner with foreign collaborators of their choice. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Models of Collaboration with NSF</strong></p>
          <p>For PIRE-2017, select counterpart national and international funding organizations are partnering with NSF to enhance opportunities for collaborative activities between U.S. investigators and their colleagues abroad, according to the following models: </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Model 1.  Joint Review (Preliminary and Full Proposals)</strong> - In this model agencies will work closely with NSF from the beginning of the PIRE process and will be sharing information during the preliminary proposal stage, the full proposal stage, the award stage, and the post award stage of the process. Information on PIRE proposals and awards (that involve partnerships with institutions served by that counterpart) will be shared with NSF counterpart agencies throughout the PIRE evaluation and award process.  Representatives of each agency partnering according to Model 1 may recommend reviewers and panelists for the preliminary and full proposal stages, and may be present during panels when preliminary and full proposals involving researchers served by their agency are being discussed.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Model 2.  Joint Review (Full Proposals)</strong> - In this model, agencies will work closely with NSF from the beginning of the PIRE process. However, coordination and sharing of information with counterpart agencies will not occur at the preliminary proposal stage and will begin only at the time full proposals are invited.  Representatives of each agency partnering according to Model 2 may recommend reviewers and panelists for the full proposal stage, and be present during panels when full proposals involving researchers served by their agency are being discussed.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Model 3.  Post-Award Recommendation Review</strong> - In this model, agencies will work closely with NSF from the moment that the PIRE-invited proposals are recommended by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) for award. Counterpart agencies will opt out of the preliminary and full proposal stage. Coordination and sharing of information with counterpart agencies will begin at the time full proposals are recommended for award.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget Preparation Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Budget Justification (3-page limit):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Budget Justification should be provided (maximum 3 pages per budget and subaward budget). A careful and realistic budget that is consistent with the proposed activities will add to the overall strength of a proposal.</li>
          <li>Explore use of off-campus indirect cost rates whenever appropriate. Provide indirect cost rate calculations and the basis to which both on campus and off-campus rates apply.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Required Costs: </strong>Include costs of travel for two project participants for one trip per year to the Washington, D.C. area to participate in a 1.5 day PIRE Grantees' meeting. In addition, include costs of travel for two project participants in year three of the project to attend a PIRE Reverse Site Visit in the Washington, D.C. area.  Also include costs to fund a project administrator to help manage the project, thus allowing the PIs to focus on the research agenda of the award.</p>
        <p><strong>Allowable Costs for NSF PIRE Budget:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A significant portion of direct costs should fund <strong>U.S. undergraduate students, graduate students, and/or early career researchers </strong>to conduct collaborative research-related activities at foreign sites.</li>
          <li><strong>Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits for senior project personnel</strong>: Up to two months per year for the PI and up to one month per year for other senior project personnel, within the limits established in NSF's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/PIRE/PAPPG%202016.pdf" target="_blank">Proposal and Award Policy and Procedures Guide</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits for a project administrator, postdoctoral scholars, other professionals, graduate students, secretarial-clerical, or administrative staff </strong>who will perform dedicated work on the PIRE project.</li>
          <li><strong>Participant Support Costs: </strong>Stipends, travel, subsistence and other costs of participation for undergraduate students or K-12 teachers should be included under Participant Support Costs. Stipends for undergraduate students should be budgeted at rates comparable to those in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517</a>) in addition to any travel and subsistence costs incurred while abroad. Travel, subsistence and other costs of participation in PIRE project meetings and workshops for faculty, researchers and students from non-grantee institutions (who are not included in subawards) should also be included under Participant Support Costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel: </strong>Research-related travel support (i.e., airfare, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses). For living expenses abroad, applicants are encouraged to work with international counterparts to develop realistic budget requests. For example, access to university guest housing or similar facilities should be explored. Cost-effective arrangements should be made for individuals residing at the international site for extended periods and for projects involving on-going exchanges of short-term visitors. Costs for lodging, meals and incidental expenses (MI&amp;E) should not exceed the authorized <a title="http://aoprals.state.gov/content.asp?content_id=184&amp;menu_id=81" href="http://aoprals.state.gov/content.asp?content_id=184&amp;menu_id=81">U.S. Government per diem rates</a>, calculated at the daily rate for the first 30 days of a project visit, and 50 percent of that rate for all time after that.</li>
          <li><strong>Expenses related to project assessment: </strong>Should include consultant fees for internal or external evaluators and costs associated with tracking participating students beyond graduation.  Costs should be limited to no more than 10% of total direct costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Direct Costs: </strong>May include PIRE-specific items, for example, research and education communication linkages between institutions, language training, non-travel costs associated with coordination meetings, and preparation/orientation of students for living abroad.</li>
          <li>All expected <strong>subawards </strong>should be included, regardless of amount.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment: </strong>PIRE is not intended to support the purchase, operation or maintenance of moderate to large equipment. Only limited equipment costs can be included.</li>
          <li><strong>NSF awards normally support the U.S. portion of the collaboration. </strong>However, when collaborators are scientists and engineers from a developing country or from a country whose currency is not convertible, limited funds may be requested to support their participation in the project. Proposers should consult the cognizant Office of International Science and Engineering program officer for the country(ies) in question (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/country-list.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/country-list.jsp</a>). U.S. PIs planning to collaborate with developing country partners are encouraged to consider the potential for USAID collateral support of their partners through the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research Program (PEER Science), as described in section II.D.11.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although reciprocal visits by international researchers and students to U.S. institutions are encouraged, NSF will not usually pay for the expenses of foreign scientists or students undertaking such visits; however, when projects involve exchanges of researchers and/or students, reciprocal arrangements for provision of housing and subsistence are encouraged, with adherence to the overall principle that each side supports equivalent costs<strong>.</strong></p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <p><a name="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4> 
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
   
        <p>To be considered by PIRE reviewers:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Value Added through International Partnership and perceived strength of proposed partnership and partner resources</strong></li>
        <br />
        <p>To what extent is the international partnership essential to the proposed project? How does each participating institution contribute to advancement of the PIRE project? Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts? Do all partners have or propose the funding and resources necessary to carry out the proposed project?</p>
        <li><strong>Internationally-Engaged Educational Activities</strong></li>
        <p>How do the proposed educational activities of the PIRE project promote educational excellence via international collaboration and development of a globally-engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce?</p>
        <li><strong>Institutional Engagement</strong></li>
        <p>How clearly presented are the roles and contributions of each participating organization? How well defined are anticipated benefits that each of the project's partners will gain in the proposed partnership?</p>
        <li><strong>Evaluation and Assessment</strong></p>
          <p>How effective is the proposed plan likely to be in measuring project outputs and outcomes? How clear and appropriate are the proposed metrics and criteria for measuring project accomplishments according to a well-defined schedule?</p>
        <li><strong>Project Management</strong></li></ol>
        <p>How well is the management structure described and how appropriate is that structure for effective management, coordination, logistics and oversight of the PIRE activities?</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.
        </p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
       
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Award Conditions
        </h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>.

       <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the standard reporting requirements described above, PIRE PIs must include information on: international location(s) visited, duration of stay, and research activity undertaken by all participants, noting the career stage of each participant. Each PIRE project must also provide metrics, demonstrating progress towards achieving PIRE program goals in accordance with the proposed Assessment and Management Plan. Reporting requirements will be detailed in the PIRE award letters.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
