        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) are embarking upon a collaborative research program to address compelling research challenges that arise from leveraging Big Data approaches to transform, at both human and societal scales, disaster management.</p>
            <p class="BodyA">Several recent reports have documented how transformative improvements in disaster management will require systems approaches to analyze large, noisy, and heterogeneous data and facilitate timely decision making in the face of shifting demands (<em>Computing for Disasters</em>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.cra.org/ccc/files/docs/init/computingfordisasters.pdf">http://www.cra.org/ccc/files/docs/init/computingfordisasters.pdf</a>; <em>Big Data and Disaster Management</em>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BigDataAndDisaster-v34.pdf">https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BigDataAndDisaster-v34.pdf</a>).</p>
            <p>Specifically, disaster events and responses result in non-linear behaviors, and there exist large and unique interdependences among variables, multiple concurrent temporal and spatial scales, and few single optimal solutions. The resultant complexity causes algorithmic and data complexity, as well as challenges that arise in modeling chaotic systems. Other sources of complexity include the need for maintaining data security and privacy, as well as the resilience of the underlying computing and communications infrastructure during and following a disaster event.</p>
            <p>At the same time, rapid advances in technology are enabling new opportunities for addressing disaster management. For example, new computer systems and networks &ndash; namely smartphones, tablets, and other types of edge devices; embedded and hybrid systems spanning automobiles, aircraft, chemical processing plants, and electrical power grids, etc.; sensor networks; and next-generation networking technologies spanning wireless, mobile, and cellular networks &ndash; are giving rise to potentially powerful data streams requiring novel analytics capabilities to facilitate timely and effective actions, as well as open questions about the resilience of these systems in the face of disasters.</p>
            <p>This joint NSF/JST solicitation aims to address two specific challenges in the context of leveraging technological advances and using Big Data approaches to support effective disaster management:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                capturing and processing the data associated with disasters to advance capabilities for disaster modeling as well as situational analysis and response modeling; and</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Improving the resilience and responsiveness of emerging computer systems and networks to facilitate the real-time data sensing, visualization, analysis, experimentation and prediction that is critical for time-sensitive decision making.</div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This NSF solicitation parallels an equivalent JST solicitation (available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.jst.go.jp/sicp/announce_usjoint_bdd.html">http://www.jst.go.jp/sicp/announce_usjoint_bdd.html</a>). Proposals submitted under this solicitation must describe joint research with Japanese counterparts who are requesting funding separately under the JST solicitation.</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
         
          <p>The US NSF's Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) have a history of collaboration that extends back several years under the umbrella of the Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_2.jsp#IID1">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_2.jsp#IID1</a>) funding mechanism within NSF and the J-RAPID program in Japan. In 2011, the two agencies funded a set of projects in the area of automating emergency data management to support disaster recovery. These projects helped establish new collaborations among researchers from both countries. In early 2012, a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) for Global Research on Applying Information Technology to Support Effective Disaster Management (GRAIT-DM; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/">https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/</a>) was established, with a focus on leveraging Big Data to improve the preparedness for, response to, and recovery from, disasters. This SAVI specifically promotes global research on the application of information technology by engaging Big Data producers (e.g., sensor networks researchers), managers (e.g., data analytics researchers), and consumers (e.g., disaster management researchers).</p>
          <p>In May 2013, US and Japanese principal investigators gathered in Washington, DC, to examine and prioritize collaborative research opportunities in Big Data and Disaster Research (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BigDataAndDisaster-v34.pdf">https://grait-dm.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BigDataAndDisaster-v34.pdf</a>). NSF and JST are now establishing a US-Japan joint research program in Big Data and Disaster Research (BDD).</p>
          <p>The BDD program addresses a critical subset of the issues that arise when leveraging Big Data to support effective disaster management. Consistent with other NSF solicitations, we use the term Big Data to refer to large, diverse, complex, longitudinal, and/or distributed data sets generated from instruments, sensors, Internet transactions, email, video, click streams, and/or all other digital sources available today and in the future. Unique to this particular solicitation, the focus lies on BDD research that is both transformative and challenging, at both human and societal scales.</p>
    
        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
         
          <p>Disaster events and responses are complex -- indeed, chaotic -- systems. The behaviors are not linear, are not easily decomposed into separate processes, and span multiple concurrent temporal and spatial scales. This complexity results in algorithmic and data complexity, and it also makes modeling very challenging. Other sources of complexity include the need for maintaining data security and privacy, as well as the resilience of the underlying computing and communications infrastructure.</p>
          <p>At the same time, rapid advances in technology are enabling new opportunities for addressing disaster management. For example, new computer systems and networks -- namely smartphones, tablets, and other types of edge devices; embedded and hybrid systems spanning automobiles, aircraft, chemical processing plants, and electrical power grids, etc.; sensor networks; and next-generation networking technologies spanning wireless, mobile, and cellular networks -- are giving rise to potentially powerful data streams, as well as open questions about the resilience of these systems.</p>
          <p>In this context, proposals are solicited for joint US-Japan foundational and transformative research consistent with the theme of Big Data and Disaster (BDD) Research in the two areas specified below. Importantly, given the nature of the BDD space, a proposal responsive to this solicitation may span both areas.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Capturing and Processing the Data Associated with Disasters</strong></p>
          <p>Data associated with disasters are heterogeneous; come from myriad sources, including smartphones, tablets, and other types of edge devices, sensor networks, and embedded and hybrid systems; arrive with varying volumes and velocities; carry wide ranges of confidence due to inherent accuracy, reliability, security, and privacy issues; and exhibit different priorities for different phases of a given disaster. This data milieu and associated complexity raise the need for novel approaches to enable collection, integration, storage, and usage of many different kinds of disaster data, and at the same time, improve the trust in, and reliability of, the data.</p>
          <p>Consider, for example, the ability to precisely assess the damage resulting from a disaster across a large geographic area. This task requires several types of domain-specific, real-time sensor maps at multiple time points, together with historical sensor maps for baseline and comparison purposes. One is confronted with a large, heterogeneous data set spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales and with varying levels of confidence that must be efficiently integrated and analyzed to refine damage predictions.</p>
          <p>Under this theme, we seek joint US-Japan projects that explore the design of novel approaches for capturing, integrating and storing the data associated with disasters that (a) advance capabilities for disaster modeling (to learn more about how similar disasters may be understood or predicted) and/or (b) improve situational analysis and response modeling (to help facilitate the flow of information in real time to decision makers working in the midst of a disaster).</p>
          <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Improving the Resilience and Responsiveness of Emerging Computer Systems and Networks</strong></p>
          <p>To facilitate the real-time data sensing, visualization, analysis, and prediction that is critical for time-sensitive decision making, the resilience and responsiveness of emerging computer systems and networks in the midst of a disaster zone must be improved.</p>
          <p>It is important to ensure that data analysis is highly dependable despite failures of various computing, communications, and information processing units immediately following a disaster. Given the distributed nature of such computational capabilities, it can be difficult to identify which units have failed and to quickly determine how best to address such failures. For example, if roadway sensors and cell towers are disrupted by a disaster, are there alternative means for detecting this disruption, and are there other data that one can use to communicate traffic flow data for decision making purposes?</p>
          <p>Research is thus needed on disaster-proof dependable online system health monitoring tools to enable the rapid identification of faulty components and the activation of redundant standby units to ensure correct and timely completion of the analyses. In addition, to achieve effective disaster management, the underlying computing and communications infrastructure must support significantly time-constrained communication demands, distributed and heterogeneous data, and a wide variety of information sharing needs while maintaining high levels of security and privacy. The inherent difficulty of predicting disasters, along with the cost of the redundancy needed to cover all possible disaster scenarios, may lead to temporary solutions that may be easily deployed when needed. Indeed, effective disaster mitigation may require tradeoffs between short-term fixes and comprehensive long-term solutions.</p>
          <p>Therefore, under this theme, we seek joint US-Japan projects that explore key aspects of novel networking and information technology supporting the resilient and timely data capture, communication, and integration in the face of infrastructure disruption due to both natural and man-made disasters.</p>
          <p>Projects involving collaborations between computer scientists, including data scientists, and experts in disaster preparedness and response are encouraged.</p>

        <p>In determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:</p>
        <p>Collaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. Chapter II, Section D.4 of the Grant Proposal Guide provides additional information on collaborative proposals.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Proposal Preparation Information: </strong>FastLane will check for required sections of the full proposal, in accordance with <em>Grant Proposal Guide</em> (GPG) instructions described in Chapter II.C.2. The GPG requires submission of: Project Summary; Project Description; References Cited; Biographical Sketch(es); Budget; Budget Justification; Current and Pending Support; Facilities, Equipment &amp; Other Resources; Data Management Plan; and Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan, if applicable. If a required section is missing, <strong>FastLane will not accept the proposal. </strong></p>
        <p>Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions. If the solicitation instructions do not require a GPG-required section to be included in the proposal, insert text or upload a document in that section of the proposal that states, &quot;Not Applicable for this Program Solicitation.&quot; Doing so will enable FastLane to accept your proposal.</p>
        <p><em>Please note that per guidance in the GPG, the Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, you can decide where to include this section within the Project Description</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>In addition to the guidelines in the GPG or NSF Grants.gov Application Guide, proposal preparation instructions specific to the preparation of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are provided below:</strong></p>
        <p class="BodyA">It is expected that the Japanese researchers taking part in the joint research project will submit proposals separately to JST in accordance with JST's guidelines and procedures. US researchers will submit to NSF in accordance with NSF's guidelines and procedures. Proposals must be coordinated; it is expected that the Project Summary, Project Description, References Cited, Biographical Sketches, Collaboration and Management Plan, Intellectual Property Plan, and List of Personnel will be identical in both the NSF and JST submissions. Bibliographies must include not only the references relevant to the work to be undertaken by US principal investigators but also those relevant to the work to be undertaken by their Japanese counterparts. Furthermore, <strong>Biographical Sketches for both the researchers to be funded by NSF and the researchers to be funded by JST must be included in the proposals</strong> submitted separately to NSF and JST. US Principal Investigators (PIs) taking part in a joint research project are expected to coordinate their NSF submissions with their Japanese counterparts' JST submissions.</p>
        <p>The following information supplements the guidelines provided in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES   </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14043/nsf14043.pdf"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.   </p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF&rsquo;s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation&rsquo;s most creative scientists and engineers.  NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. </p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
       <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4><strong>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</strong></h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
           </li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />
           </li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />
           </li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to the merit review principles and criteria described above, BDD Research proposals will also be evaluated by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The extent to which the proposed work supports the solicitation theme of Big Data and Disaster Research; and</li>
          <li>The extent to which the work and collaboration plans describe a unified project between the US and Japanese participants and the added value to be expected from the US-Japan collaboration proposed.</li>
        </ul>
   
    
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>NSF will manage and conduct the review process of proposals submitted in accordance with NSF standards and procedures. Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. Following, and based upon the results of, independent and parallel review processes by NSF and JST, program managers at the two agencies will discuss recommendations. During this discussion, NSF and JST program managers may share unattributed reviews (i.e., the reviews will not include reviewer identities) with one another. The NSF Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of both the US and Japanese review processes and the results of the discussions with JST program managers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals.  In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process).</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
       <p> <strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
        <p>NSF intends to make awards to the US collaborators named in the recommended proposals. JST intends to make awards to the Japanese collaborators named in the recommended proposals. Both NSF and JST awardees will acknowledge the collaboration in their award notices. NSF awards will be made in FY 2015 as standard grants. The awards will be made for three-year periods.</p>
        <p>Grantees of this program will be expected to attend, and should budget for, annual grantee review meetings for the purpose of sharing research progress with representatives of other projects funded under this solicitation as well as NSF and JST representatives and other persons designated by NSF and JST. The first such meeting will be held approximately 9 months after the awards are made, and succeeding meetings will be held every 12 months thereafter.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
