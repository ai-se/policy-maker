<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI<sup>2</sup>) is a bold and long-term investment that maintains a sustained focus on realizing the Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf10015">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf10015</a>), which envisions a highly reusable and interoperable cyberinfrastructure architecture that integrates large-scale computing, high-speed networks, massive data archives, instruments and major facilities, observatories, experiments, and embedded sensors and actuators, across the nation and the world, to help make great strides towards revolutionizing virtually every science and engineering discipline.</p>

<p>Software is a primary modality through which CIF21 innovation and discovery has been realized. Software permeates all aspects and layers of cyberinfrastructure (from application codes and frameworks, programming systems, libraries and system software, to middleware, operating systems, networking and the low-level drivers), and catalyzes new thinking, paradigms and practices in science and engineering. Software, in fact, is a cyberinfrastructure in itself.</p>

<p>This software cyberinfrastructure requires a robust, agile architecture and a highly usable and reusable service model, one that allows evolution in order to address increasing scale and complexity, accommodate disruptive hardware trends, allow ever-increasing data volumes, complex application structures and workflows, and emerging considerations such as security, reproducibility, fault tolerance and energy efficiency. Additionally, software must support new scientific and engineering frontiers and their computational methodologies. Education is an important element needed to sustain this vision. SI<sup>2</sup> contributes to an able workforce capable of exploiting the full capability of the cyberinfrastructure and the promise for innovation in science and engineering.</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2 </sup>program focuses on supporting robust, reliable and sustainable software that will support and advance sustained scientific innovation and discovery. Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to describe their approach to quality software development through a defined software engineering process that includes software testing, the appropriate use of analysis tools and capabilities such as those made available through the Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://continuousassurance.org/">https://continuousassurance.org/</a>), and collaborations with resources such as Software Carpentry (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://software-carpentry.org/">http://software-carpentry.org/</a>) and the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://trustedci.org/">http://trustedci.org/</a>), in order to gain access to expertise where needed, such as in software design and engineering, as well as in cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (CISE/ACI) partners with Directorates and Offices across the Foundation to support SI<sup>2</sup>, a long-term comprehensive program focused on realizing a sustained software infrastructure that is an integral part of CIF21. The goal of this program is to catalyze and nurture the interdisciplinary processes required to support the entire software lifecycle, and result in the development of sustainable community software elements and reusable components at all levels of the software stack. The program addresses all aspects of cyberinfrastructure, from embedded sensor systems and instruments, to desktops and high-end data and computing systems, to major instruments and facilities.</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program aspires to support vibrant partnerships among academia, government, and industry researchers, including international entities, for the development and stewardship of a sustainable software infrastructure that can enhance productivity and accelerate innovation in science and engineering.</p>

<p>For 2017, and in addition to regular SI<sup>2</sup> proposals, the SI<sup>2</sup> solicitation welcomes proposals that advance the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI), an effort aimed at sustaining and enhancing the U.S. scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in high-performance computing (HPC) research, development, and deployment. Information about the NSCI together with the strategic plans, results of community workshops, background studies and other relevant resources, which suggest priority areas in both the domain sciences and the HPC and software infrastructure, are available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsci/">https://www.nsf.gov/nsci/</a>. Proposers are encouraged to review these materials for priority areas identified by the research community.</p>

<p>As in previous rounds of this program, SI<sup>2</sup> includes three classes of awards:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Scientific Software Elements (SSE):</strong> SSE awards target small groups that will create and deploy robust software elements for which there is a demonstrated need that will advance one or more significant areas of science and engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Software Integration (SSI): </strong>SSI awards target larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and application of common software infrastructure aimed at solving common research problems faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and engineering. SSI awards will result in a sustainable community software framework serving a diverse community or communities.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Software Innovation Institutes (S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>): </strong>S<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> awards are intended to establish long-term hubs of excellence in software infrastructure and technologies, which will serve a research community of substantial size and disciplinary breadth. S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> includes two subclasses of awards: <em>Conceptualization</em> <em>Awards</em>, which are planning awards aimed at organizing an interdisciplinary community and understanding their software requirements and challenges; and <em>Implementation</em> <em>Awards</em>, which will be made to implement community activities that support software infrastructure, for example, such as those developed by the conceptualization awards. <strong>Only Conceptualization proposals will be accepted for this solicitation cycle.</strong> However, successful Conceptualization proposals must reflect the quality, commitment, and planning that will be needed to lead to full Implementation awards. Conceptualization proposals submitted to NSF in response to this solicitation must exhibit clear relevance to the overall SI<sup>2</sup> program and should be responsive to this solicitation and its review criteria. Proposals that are not relevant or not responsive to the solicitation will not be considered for funding and will be returned without review. Conceptualization proposals must also be in areas not covered by current Conceptualization and Implementation awards. For a list of awards, see Implementation of NSF Software Vision (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program recently launched its first two Software Institutes (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?preview=y&amp;cntn_id=189347">https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?preview=y&amp;cntn_id=189347</a>). The Science Gateways Software Institute (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.sciencegateways.org">http://www.sciencegateways.org</a>) and the Molecular Science Software Institute (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://molssi.org">http://molssi.org</a>) will serve as long-term hubs of excellence and community engagement in the areas of building effective science gateways and in advancing discoveries in molecular science and materials through the use of advanced software tools. Proposals of all types should seek to leverage these Institutes, where appropriate.</p>

<p>Please refer to (i) A Vision and Strategy for Software for Science, Engineering, and Education (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf12113">NSF 12-113</a>) and (ii) Implementation of NSF Software Vision (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817</a>) for further information about NSF's vision for software as part of cyberinfrastructure and the programs that support this vision.</p>

<p>Prospective Principal Investigators (PIs) should be aware that SI<sup>2</sup> is a multi-directorate activity and that they are encouraged to submit proposals for software with broad, interdisciplinary interest. PIs are encouraged to refer to core program descriptions, Dear Colleague Letters, and recently posted initiatives on directorate and divisional home pages to gain insight about the priorities for the relevant areas of science and engineering to which their proposal may be responsive.</p>

<p>As not all divisions are participating at the same level and division priorities differ, it is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact program officer(s) from the list of Cognizant Program Officers in the division(s) that typically support the scientists and engineers who would make use of the proposed work, to ascertain that the scientific focus and budget of the proposed work are appropriate for this solicitation.

><blockquote>
<p>Proposals may only be submitted by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universities and Colleges - Universities and two- and four-year colleges (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in, the US acting on behalf of their faculty members. Such organizations also are referred to as academic institutions.</li>
<li>Non-profit, non-academic organizations: Independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies and similar organizations in the U.S. associated with educational or research activities.</li>
<li>Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) may not receive funds directly from NSF under this solicitation.</li>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Who May Serve as PI:</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no restrictions or limits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization:</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no restrictions or limits for SSE and SSI proposals.</p>

<p>Each organization may only submit one S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization proposal within the calendar year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or Co-PI:</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>An individual may participate as PI, co-PI or other Senior Personnel in at most one full proposal in the pair of SSE and SSI competitions that occurs in a given calendar year.

Any individual whose biographical sketch is provided as part of the proposal will be considered as Senior Personnel in the proposed activity, with or without financial support from the project. In the event that an individual exceeds this limit, any proposal submitted to this solicitation with this individual listed as PI, co-PI, or Senior Personnel after the first proposal is received at NSF will be returned without review. No exceptions will be made. For this purpose, a multi-institution collaborative project is treated as one proposal that is considered submitted when the last component proposal is submitted.</p>

<p>There is no limit on the number of S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization proposals per PI, though there is a limit of one S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization proposal per institution per calendar year.</p>

<h3><a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<div>
<p>Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI<sup>2</sup>) is a bold and long-term investment that maintains a sustained focus on realizing the Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf10015">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf10015</a>), which envisions a highly reusable and interoperable cyberinfrastructure architecture that integrates large-scale computing, high-speed networks, massive data archives, instruments and major facilities, observatories, experiments, and embedded sensors and actuators, across the nation and the world, to help make great strides towards revolutionizing virtually every science and engineering discipline.</p>

<p>Software is a primary modality through which CIF21 innovation and discovery has been realized. Software permeates all aspects and layers of cyberinfrastructure (from application codes and frameworks, programming systems, libraries and system software, to middleware, operating systems, networking and the low-level drivers), and catalyzes new thinking, paradigms and practices in science and engineering. Software, in fact, is a cyberinfrastructure in itself. </p>

<p>This software cyberinfrastructure requires a robust, agile architecture and a highly usable and reusable service model, one that allows evolution in order to address increasing scale and complexity, accommodate disruptive hardware trends, allow ever-increasing data volumes, complex application structures and workflows, and emerging considerations such as security, reproducibility, fault tolerance and energy efficiency. Additionally, software must support new scientific and engineering frontiers and their computational methodologies. Education is an important element needed to sustain this vision. SI<sup>2</sup> contributes to an able workforce capable of exploiting the full capability of the cyberinfrastructure and the promise for innovation in science and engineering.</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2 </sup>program focuses on supporting robust, reliable and sustainable software that will support and advance sustained scientific innovation and discovery. Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to describe their approach to quality software development through a defined software engineering process that includes software testing, consider the use of analysis tools and capabilities such as those made available through the Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://continuousassurance.org/">https://continuousassurance.org/</a>), and include collaborations with resources such as Software Carpentry (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://software-carpentry.org/">http://software-carpentry.org/</a>) and the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://trustedci.org/">http://trustedci.org/</a>), in order to gain access to expertise where needed, such as in software design and engineering, as well as in cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (CISE/ACI) partners with Directorates and Offices across the Foundation to support SI<sup>2</sup>, a long-term comprehensive program focused on realizing a sustained software infrastructure that is an integral part of CIF21. The goal of this program is to catalyze and nurture the interdisciplinary processes required to support the entire software lifecycle, and result in the development of sustainable community software elements and reusable components at all levels of the software stack. The program addresses all aspects of cyberinfrastructure, from embedded sensor systems and instruments, to desktops and high-end data and computing systems, to major instruments and facilities.</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program aspires to support vibrant partnerships among academia, government, and industry researchers, including international entities, for the development and stewardship of a sustainable software infrastructure that can enhance productivity and accelerate innovation in science and engineering.</p>

<p>For 2017, and in addition to regular SI<sup>2</sup> proposals, the SI<sup>2</sup> solicitation welcomes proposals that advance the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI), an effort aimed at sustaining and enhancing the U.S. scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in HPC research, development, and deployment. Information about the NSCI together with the strategic plans, results of community workshops, background studies and other relevant resources, which suggest priority areas in both the domain sciences and the High Performance Computing (HPC) and software infrastructure, are available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsci/">https://www.nsf.gov/nsci/</a>. Proposers are encouraged to review these materials for priority areas identified by the research community.</p>

<h3><a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<div>
<p>The goal of the SI<sup>2</sup> program is to create a software ecosystem that scales from individual or small groups of software innovators to large hubs of software excellence. The program includes three classes of awards:</p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Scientific Software Elements (SSE)</li>
<li>Scientific Software Integration (SSI)</li>
<li>Scientific Software Innovation Institutes (S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>This solicitation includes SSE and SSI classes of awards and </strong><strong>S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2 </sup></strong><strong>Conceptualization awards only.</strong></p>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program envisions an integrated software infrastructure composed of interlocking projects of the above three classes. Specifically, SSE awardees are expected to develop meaningful affiliations with one or more SSI groups and with S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> institutes as they come online in future years. Similarly, it is expected that each SSE or SSI group will affiliate with one or more S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2 </sup>institutes as they come online. S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> institutes are expected to link with each other as well as with other major elements of the national cyberinfrastructure.</p>

<p>A competitive SI<sup>2</sup> proposal will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe application areas in science or engineering where the identified software is needed and describe how the use of the identified software will have a significant impact on science and engineering research;</li>
<li>Describe the targeted user communities of the proposed software and how they will be engaged; and</li>
<li>Provide a compelling discussion of the software's potential use by a wider audience and its contribution to a national cyberinfrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scientific Software Elements (SSE)</strong>: SSE awards target small groups that will create and deploy robust software elements for which there is a demonstrated need that will advance one or more significant areas of science and engineering. It is expected that the created software elements will be designed so as to demonstrate potential for addressing issues of sustainability, manageability, usability and interoperability, and will be disseminated into the community as reusable software resources. The development approach may support the hardening of early prototypes and/or expanding functionality to increase end-user relevance.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific Software Integration (SSI):</strong> SSI awards target larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and application of common software infrastructure aimed at solving common research problems faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and engineering. SSI awards will result in a sustainable community software framework serving a diverse community or communities. These awards will focus on software architectures, processes that explicitly address issues of sustainability, manageability, usability, composability, and interoperability, as well as environments (e.g., code repository, build and test framework, reporting mechanisms, etc.) that are meaningful for the targeted science community. Well-reasoned dissemination and outreach mechanisms, pathways for integration of community software elements (such as those developed by SSE teams) into the developed framework, as well as support structures, will be an integral part of these awards. When appropriate, collaborations with industry and government entities, as well as partnering with international efforts are encouraged. Some SSI awards are anticipated to be continuing grants, and funds will be released annually subject to agreed-upon milestones, and based on approval by NSF and the availability of funds.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific Software Innovation Institutes (S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>) </strong>will focus on the establishment of long-term hubs of excellence in software infrastructure and technologies, which will serve a research community of substantial size and disciplinary breadth. It is expected that outcomes of S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> go beyond the software itself and also include the infrastructure and process by which software is developed and sustained in response to, and to successfully enable, transformative new science. These institutes will provide expertise, processes and architectures, resources, and implementation mechanism to transform computational science and engineering innovations and community software into robust and sustained software infrastructure for enabling science and engineering, which in turn will transform research practices and productivity. S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> proposals are expected to bring together interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and educators along with software engineers and technologists. An S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> proposal must describe the vision and rationale for the proposed institute as a multi-faceted enterprise with credible connections to the community it serves. The proposal must make a compelling case for the institute's need and scope, and state its anticipated impact on the target communities. Furthermore, in addition to innovating in the domain (or domains) as well as the computational and computer science aspects of the software, the proposals must also focus on the required processes and services necessary to support the community. The institutes will provide necessary structures and mechanisms for support, outreach, and workforce development, with a proactive approach to diversity, and will stimulate interaction between all stakeholders through various means including the definition of joint research directions, community standards and models, and collaborative development activities. The institutes will also provide pathways for community involvement, enabling software elements developed within the community to be transitioned to conform to community software frameworks, standards and processes, and to be made accessible, usable and extendible by the community. Institutes are encouraged to leverage existing infrastructure investments. Where appropriate, engagement with industry and government entities as well as partnering with international efforts are encouraged. Proposals should identify a clear set of near-, mid-, and long-term goals, and should describe how the project will organize itself to accomplish those goals. Finally, and very importantly, proposals should include a model for longer-term sustainability of the institute after NSF-funding has ended.</p>

<p>S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> awards are subdivided into Conceptualization and Implementation awards which are described below.</p>

<p><strong>(a) Conceptualization Awards: </strong>S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization Awards are planning awards aimed at organizing an interdisciplinary community and understanding its software requirements and challenges. Example activities that may be undertaken as part of a Conceptualization Award include focused workshops, special sessions at professional meetings, sandpits, focus groups, etc. These awards will typically be 1 year in duration. The product of a Conceptualization Award will be a strategic plan for enabling science and education through a sustained software infrastructure that will be freely available to the community, and will address the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>the science community and the specific grand challenge research questions that the S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> will support;</li>
<li>specific software elements and frameworks that are relevant to the community, the sustainability challenges that need to be addressed, and why addressing these challenges will be transformative;</li>
<li>appropriate software architectures and lifecycle processes, development, testing and deployment methodologies, validation and verification processes, end usability and interface considerations, and required infrastructure and technologies;</li>
<li>the required organizational, personnel and management structures and operational processes;</li>
<li>the requirements and necessary mechanisms for human resource development, including integration of education and training, mentoring of students, postdoctoral fellows as well as software professionals, and proactively addressing diversity and broadening participation;</li>
<li>potential approaches for long-term sustainability of the software institute as well as the software; and</li>
<li>potential risks including risks associated with establishment and execution, necessary infrastructure and associated technologies, community engagement, and long-term sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The strategic plan resulting from the conceptualization phase is expected to serve as the conceptual design upon which a subsequent S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Implementation proposal could be based.</p>

<p>Note that Conceptualization proposals will only be encouraged when NSF funding is available. Thus PIs are encouraged to contact relevant NSF program officers before submitting such proposals.</p>

<p><strong>(b) S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Implementation Awards:</strong> While this solicitation cycle does not include S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Implementation proposals, these awards are described here for completeness. S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Implementation Awards aim to implement community strategic plans, such as those outlined in conceptualization phase described above. Proposals for Implementation Awards will only be considered in response to specific areas that are explicitly identified by NSF. The size of these awards as well as the structure of the institute will be based, in part, on the targeted community and its needs. Awards are expected to be cooperative agreements between NSF and the awardee(s), and funds will be released annually subject to agreed-to milestones, annual project reviews (starting 18 months after a given project begins), and based on approval by NSF and the availability of funds.</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program recently launched its first two software institutes (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?preview=y&amp;cntn_id=189347">https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?preview=y&amp;cntn_id=189347</a>). The Science Gateways Software Institute (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://www.sciencegateways.org">http://www.sciencegateways.org</a>) and the Molecular Science Software Institute (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://molssi.org">http://molssi.org</a>) will serve as long-term hubs of excellence and community engagement in the areas of building effective science gateways and in advancing discoveries in molecular science and materials through the use of advanced software tools. Proposals of all types should seek to leverage these Institutes, where appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Industry and International Participation in SI<sup>2</sup></strong>: NSF encourages participation by industry and international collaborators in all classes of SI<sup>2</sup> awards where it clearly strengthens the proposed activity (e.g., involvement of specific and unique expertise or resources or addressing sustainability).</p>

<p>International participants are encouraged to seek support from their funding organizations. NSF funds may not be used to support the expenses of international researchers at their home institution. However, NSF funds may be used for travel expenses for US scientists and students in exchange integral to the project, or for international collaborators to participate in activities in the US. For those who plan to submit a proposal with international counterparts, please contact the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) program officer who covers that country (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/od/oise/country-list.jsp</a>).</p>

<p>The SI<sup>2</sup> program recognizes that software is a fundamental infrastructure that spans academic, government, civic, and commercial organizations. The program encourages proposals to explore novel partnerships beyond academe wherever beneficial and permissible within the guidelines of the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/nsf17_1.pdf">NSF 17-1</a>).</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="awd_info" id="awd_info"></a>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>

<div>
<p>Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds.</p>

<p>An SSE award shall not exceed a total of $500,000 and a duration of 3 years. SSI awards shall range from $200,000 to $1,000,000 per year, and shall be 3 to 5 years in duration. Projects in the upper portion of this range must be exceptional in terms of scientific impact, and as with all proposals, should be discussed with program officers from the divisions that fund the researchers that would be impacted. Proposed funding amounts should be commensurate with the work being proposed, the size of the community that will be affected, and the level of impact anticipated. Note that SSE and SSI are not categories of funding, but rather, are types of projects, as described elsewhere in this solicitation.<br /> <br /> The number of SSE and SSI awards will be determined by separate review processes and will be based on the proposals submitted and the availability of funds.</p>

<p>The actual number of S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization awards may vary based on the quality of proposals, responsiveness to the solicitation, and availability of funds. Note that funded conceptualization awards may lead to full implementation awards in the future, but that the number of full implementation awards will be smaller than the number of conceptualization awards. Up to 3 S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization awards (each up to $500,000) may be funded in FY 2017, totaling $1,500,000.</p>

<p>It is expected that a significant number of the awards made through this solicitation will be to projects that are strongly aligned with the National Strategic Computing Initiative.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact a program officer from the list of Cognizant Program Officers in the division(s) closest to the major disciplinary impact of the proposed work to ascertain that the scientific and engineering focus and budget of the proposed work are appropriate for this solicitation.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>

<p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>

<p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>

<p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>

<p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<a name="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>

<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>

<p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>

<p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
<li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
<li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>

<p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>

<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>

<p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to<ol type="a">
<li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
<li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
<li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
<li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
<li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
</ol>

<p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>

<p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All proposals must clearly address the following solicitation-specific review criteria through well-identified proposal elements.</p>

<p>SSE and SSI Proposals:</p>

<ul>
<li>To what extent does the proposed software fill a recognized need and advance research capability within a significant area (or areas) of science and engineering?</li>
<li>To what extent does the project integrate innovation and research into the project activities?</li>
<li>How well does the proposal describe how the proposed software compares to alternative or existing elements (including commercial solutions)?</li>
<li>If the PI claims to have previously developed widely-used software, particularly if funded under an SI<sup>2</sup> award, how significant was the use and impact of the previously funded software, as shown by the quantifiable evidence in the proposal? Is the software properly listed in the PI's biographical sketch? What progress has been made towards sustainability?</li>
<li>To what extent has the software architecture and software engineering process been described, and how well does it support the goals of the project? To what extent has the proposal described an approach to quality software development through a defined software engineering process that includes software testing, and the use of analysis tools and capabilities such as those made available through the Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://continuousassurance.org/">https://continuousassurance.org/</a>)? Have proposals included collaborations with resources such as Software Carpentry (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://software-carpentry.org/">http://software-carpentry.org/</a>) and the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?http://trustedci.org/">http://trustedci.org/</a>), in order to gain access to expertise where needed, such as in software design and engineering and cybersecurity?</li>
<li>How well does the proposal present and discuss the project plan and timeline, including proof-of-concept demonstrations of key software elements and the steps necessary to take the software from prototype to dissemination into the community as reusable software resources? How well does the project plan include user interaction, a community-driven approach, and a timeline of new feature releases?</li>
<li>How well does the software engineering and development plan include and/or enable the integration of relevant activities to ensure the software is responsive to new computing developments?</li>

<li>How appropriate is the plan to extend the work to additional user communities?</li>
<li>How well does the project address the sustainability of the developed software beyond the lifetime of the award?</li>
<li>To what extent does the proposed software build upon and leverage, and to what extent is it interoperable with, widely used tools by the community, and NSF and national cyberinfrastructure investments, as appropriate?</li>
</ul>

<p>For S<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup> Conceptualization Proposals:</p>

<ul>
<li>How compelling is the rationale for the envisioned institute, its mission and goals, and its responsiveness to community needs and to programmatic areas of interest to the SI<sup>2</sup> program and associated Dear Colleague Letters?</li>
<li>To what extent does the proposal describe the scientific and engineering communities and software elements/frameworks to be targeted, and the specific software sustainability challenges that will be addressed?</li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>

<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<h3><a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>

<h4><a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>

<p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>

<h4><a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p><p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Awardees are expected to participate in annual PI meetings with travel costs supported by the award.</li>
<li>Some awards, in particular SSI awards, are anticipated to be continuing grants, where funds are released annually subject to agreed-upon milestones, based on approval by NSF and the availability of funds.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>

<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>

<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>

<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>

<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>

<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
