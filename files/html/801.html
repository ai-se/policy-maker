      <h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">The CRCD/EI program will support the design, development,
        testing and dissemination of innovative approaches for increasing the
        effectiveness of the learning experience in IT. This may include innovative
        pedagogy or integrating IT&#160;research results into courses and curricula.
        The research, whether ongoing or completed, may be drawn from any research&#160;activity
        in the computer and information sciences and engineering fields. (See
        http://www.cise.nsf.gov for programs supported by CISE). &#160;At a minimum,
        the set of individuals involved in a project should be chosen to ensure
        an appropriate level of expertise in teaching, curriculum development,
        and in the relevant research areas. Addition of individuals with expertise
        in learning sciences, education, information technologies, cognitive
        sciences and/or related areas, if appropriate to the project, is encouraged.
        It is not required that the principal investigator or other active participants
        in the project be the originators of the research results which are to
        be transferred. However, the proposal should describe the&#160;participants'
        expertise in the research area(s). The&#160;CRCD/EI Program supports
        projects that, for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Integrate state-of-the-art research advances in emerging information
            technology areas into undergraduate and introductory graduate courses
            and curricula;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Address a need for innovative curricula, courses, textbooks, tools,
            instructional modules and instructional laboratories;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Engage faculty researchers in curriculum innovation in the context
            that education and research are of equal value and complementary
            parts of an integrative IT education enterprise;</li>
          <li>Focus on&#160;the recruitment and retention of women, underrepresented
            minorities and the disabled in IT educational programs;</li>
          <li>Provide for the adoption, adaption, and/or dissemination&#160;of
            effective, innovative curricula and pedagogy;</li>
          <li>Provide national leadership for developing new models of learning
            and innovative teaching environments;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Incorporate learning theory and cognitive sciences research that
            promotes student-based learning styles and integrate their education
            and research roles;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Promote broad dissemination, distribution and adoption of exemplary
            practices;</li>
          <li>Prepare IT students to perform in rapidly changing, globally competitive
            environments;</li>
          <li>Develop students' capability and motivation to engage in lifelong
            learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Projects supported by the CRCD/EI program are expected to act as national
          models of excellence by being prototypes of educational experiences
          for use by other institutions.&#160;Proposals should contain a detailed
          set of activities for communicating the results of projects. Collaboration
          with other institutions, particularly as part of the dissemination
          activities, is highly encouraged. The formality, level, and nature
          of this collaboration will be the decision of the institutions concerned;
          however the effectiveness of the dissemination activities will be part
          of the evaluation criteria.</p>
        <p><strong>Participants</strong></p>
        <p>Projects must involve a diverse set of participants including: persons
          with research domain expertise; undergraduate/graduate students; and
          those with expertise in educational methodologies and pedagogy. Describe
          participants' prior work and&#160;the expertise they bring to the project.</p>
        <p>Multi-institution participation is strongly encouraged in all projects
          and is required for projects involving dissemination and adoption of
          exemplary practices. Industrial participation, where appropriate, should
          also be incorporated into the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Management Plan</strong></p>
        <p>The Project Management Plan, presented as a description, table or
          diagram, should outline&#160;specific project tasks, dates when the
          tasks will be completed, and the identity of the project participant
          who will be responsible for implementing the task. The dates should
          be fine-grained (for example, monthly) to insure that the plan is well
          thought out.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Evaluation, Implementation, Dissemination</strong></p>
        <p><em>Evaluation</em></p>
        <p>Projects supported under the&#160;CRCD/EI program are inherently innovative
          and experimental in character. Thus, it is essential that the methodologies
          and results of each project be subjected to careful evaluation to ensure
          that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> The objectives of the project are being&#160;advanced by the projects'
            activities;</li>
          <li>Effective measures for evaluation are considered in cooperation
            with persons experienced in assessment and evaluation;&#160;</li>
          <li>Evaluation includes: measurable objectives (for example, objectives
            for student learning); procedures to measure achievement; a system
            for monitoring the progress of the project in relation to these measures;</li>
          <li>Reliable evaluation usually requires multiple measures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Provide a description of the evaluation plan that addresses the points
          listed above.</p>
        <p><em>Implementation and Dissemination</em></p>
        <p>To achieve the desired national impact, the project must:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide for wide dissemination within the IT education community;&#160;</li>
          <li>Demonstrate the accomplishment of the projects' objectives;&#160;</li>
          <li>Impact the quality and utility of what is learned or produced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A dissemination plan should include: designation of the audience to
          be reached; a description of the information or material to be disseminated;
          the means of dissemination (such as delivery by electronic means, through
          workshops, conference presentations, textbooks, laboratory manuals,
          software, audiovisual materials, journal articles, etc.); a description
          of how these products will be made available to the&#160;IT community
          and others. It should provide&#160;a detailed plan for transferring
          project results to other institutions and the CISE community.</p>
        <p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>
        <p>For <em>projects that rely on physical facilities</em>, provide a&#160;description
          of the equipment, software, and other facilities and materials currently
          available to support the project.</p>
        <p>In addition, for equipment, software and other items&#160;for which
          funding is requested, provide&#160;descriptions with itemized and total
          cost, and a brief rationale for&#160;their selection. For equipment,
          include a representative manufacturer and model number, if possible.
          Describe maintenance costs per year and method of computation.</p>
        <p>Note: The CRCD/EI Program will&#160;only fund equipment or software
          that is necessary to&#160;support&#160;the research and/or development
          foundations of the project. Funding will not be provided&#160;to equip&#160;student
          laboratories.</p>
        <p><strong>Other</strong></p>
        <p>Provide annual budgets showing costs for each of the years requested.
          FastLane automatically creates the cumulative budget.</p>
        <p>If a proposal includes funding for any subawardees, the lead institution's
          summary and annual budgets should include the total amount for any
          subawardees in Line G.5 and the subaward must be justified in the budget
          justification section.&#160; Proposals should also discuss the proposed

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></A> <B>Additional Review Criteria</B>:
        <p>In addition, specific criteria to be used to evaluate the proposals
          in this program will include the following items:</p>
        <p>Potential of the project to act as a national model of excellence
          for the CISE community.&#160;</p>
        <p>Overall merit of the proposed education-related activities.&#160;</p>
        <p>Overall merit of the research results to be transferred to the instructional
          domain and its potential impact on US industrial competitiveness and
          education (if appropriate).</p>
        <p>Plan for dissemination of project results.&#160;</p>
        <p>Level, nature, and appropriateness of participation by underrepresented
          groups.&#160;</p>
        <p>Plan for management and operation of the project.&#160;</p>
        <p>Plan for evaluation of the project and its impact.</p>
        <p>Qualifications and demonstrated capabilities of the project team,
          their understanding of the issues involved in education reform and
          their commitment to the accomplishment of the effort.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and
          submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential
          documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the identities of
          reviewers, are available to the Principal Investigator/Project Director
          NSF&#8217;s FastLane. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation
          of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
      </UL>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc Review
        followed by Panel Review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

        <p>Standard NSF reporting requirements apply to most CRCD/EI projects.
          However, in addition to the required Annual and Final&#160;reports,
          grantees may also be&#160;asked to provide project information that
          can be used in preparing various NSF external reports. For implementation
          projects, NSF requires annual reports that are more extensive in scope
          than those required of single investigator research awards. NSF may
          also require, in the future, that projects collect and submit to NSF
          data on indicators of progress and impact.</p>
      </div>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
