<h3>
<a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Astrophysical and cosmological observations have established that atomic matter constitutes only ~5% of the mass-energy in our Universe. Cosmological models describe the remaining 95% as composed of two mysterious components: dark matter (23%) and dark energy (72%). This solicitation focuses on the study of dark matter. While there is compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, it has never been directly detected. The Standard Model of particle physics does not include a particle species with properties that can account for dark matter. But there are dark matter candidates in non-Standard Model theories. One non-Standard Model candidate for dark matter is a Weakly-Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) whose cosmic abundance today is a relic of the Big Bang. Other dark matter candidates include the axion, originally hypothesized as a solution to the strong-CP problem. Direct detection of dark matter, either WIMP, Axion, or another particle, will significantly advance our understanding of fundamental physics and the evolution of the Universe.</p><p>There are a large number of direct-detection experiments now being conducted world-wide. The large number enables a wide variety of promising technologies to be developed. These competitive experiments have comparable sensitivities for the detection of dark matter, and should all achieve their projected sensitivities and complete operations within the next few years. These experiments may or may not detect dark matter. If they do not, then there is a need for the next generation of more sensitive experiments. If they do detect dark matter, then more sensitive experiments will be needed to confirm, and to study in detail, the new particles. </p><p>Searches for dark matter particle candidates directly address NSF's mission of understanding the origin and unification of particles and forces and the mysterious forms of unseen energy and matter. These studies fall within the NSF/MPS/PHY Particle Astrophysics program, whose focus is on non-accelerator-based measurements of naturally occurring phenomena to learn about the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and other fundamental properties of matter and energy. </p>

<h3>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>There are three complementary methods for studying dark matter: (1) accelerator searches for dark matter particle production, (2) indirect detection of dark matter annihilation within the Galaxy, and (3) the direct detection of Galactic dark matter particles that pass through terrestrial detectors. This solicitation invites proposals for the next generation direct detection experiments. </p><p>The current generation of direct dark matter experiments should all achieve their projected sensitivities and complete operations within the next few years. The more sensitive, &quot;second generation&quot; direct detection experiments will then be required to either search with increased sensitivity or to measure in detail the detected dark matter. These next generation experiments will be selected through this solicitation for research and development and then construction beginning in FY 2014. These experiments should have roughly an order of magnitude or more improved sensitivity to dark matter compared to the currently operating experiments. The NSF and the DOE both support dark matter research. Because of the expected costs to develop the second-generation experiments the two funding agencies will closely coordinate the selection and funding of the awards and subsequent support for the experiments. </p><p>Any viable dark matter species may be the object of an investigation. The strength of theoretical arguments for the existence of a given species will be a factor in the selection process. For WIMPs, a parameter of sensitivity could be (but is not restricted to) the WIMP-nucleon cross section limit. In the case of axions, the parameter could be (but is not restricted to) a limit on the photon-axion coupling constant. It will also be important to place the next generation of experiments within the context of the current and projected future national and international dark matter research efforts. </p>

<a id="review" name="review"></a><h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES </h3>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p><p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p><p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.  </p><p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives. </p><p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot; NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p><p>1. Merit Review Principles</p><p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p><ul><li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br /> </li><li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br /> </li><li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li></ul><p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p><p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p><p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p><p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br /> </li><li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li></ul><p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p><ol><li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to <ol type="a"><li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li><li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li></ol></li><li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li><li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li><li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li><li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li></ol><p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p><p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the NSB approved merit review criteria, reviewers of these proposals will be asked to use the following additional selection criteria:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Importance of the proposed experiment within the context of the current and projected future national and international dark matter research efforts.</li>
	<li>Completeness of the flow-down from science goals to experiment performance requirements.</li>
	<li>Capability of the experiment to meet its performance requirements along with the potential scientific power of the experimental method.</li>
	<li>Completeness of the identification of current technical risks, and feasibility of the plan for technical risk reduction. The increased risk associated with methods incorporating less mature technologies may be offset by the promise of potentially superior science capabilities.</li>
	<li>Realism of project cost and schedule</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or as follows.</p>
<p>An external panel of experts will be jointly charged by the Physics Division and the Department of Energy, Office of High Energy Physics (DOE-OHEP) to evaluate all proposals received through this solicitation as well as the requests for funding for second generation dark matter experiments received by the DOE through a parallel DOE process. Ad-hoc written reviews will also be considered. The NSF proposals will be reviewed according to the primary NSF review criteria with the additional criteria described above. Selection(s) of proposals to be funded by the NSF will be made by the NSF Program Directors for Particle Astrophysics based on these evaluations, coordination with DOE-OHEP, the availability of funds and other programmatic factors. </p><p>Proposals and reviews will be shared with Program Officers at DOE-OHEP as part of the review process.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h3>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p><h4>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter.

<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p><p></p><h3>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.
