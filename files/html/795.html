        <blockquote>
          <P>As a result of recent advances
              in genomic and biochemical analysis, informatics, mathematics,
              and the engineering disciplines, it is now possible to approach
              an understanding of the integrated processes which translate the
              information contained in the genome into functioning biological
              entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems engineering approaches will be essential
              for characterizing the emergence of biological phenotypes from
              underlying hierarchies of interactions and environmental influences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding
              the quantitative systems behavior of cellular systems is important
              in its own right as well as providing a conceptual basis for biotechnological
              process development.</P>
          <P>This Quantitative Systems
              Biotechnology solicitation seeks innovative high-risk/high-return
              proposals, which combine in-depth analysis of large-scale cellular
              biological systems, or their representations, with creative software
              tools for the development of computer models as well as complementary
              quantitative experimental approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multidisciplinary
              proposals are encouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

      <H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <p>Impressive gains in genome sequencing technology and the growing number
          of completely or nearly sequenced naturally occurring or engineered
          genomes have generated substantial data. The heightened availability
          of this genome-level data provides new opportunities for systems-based
          analyses and modeling of cellular systems and biotechnological processes.
          At the same time, advances in high performance computing, massive data
          storage, and new computational paradigms provide opportunities to approach
          this challenge quantitatively and computationally.&#160;&#160;In addressing
          the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and to accelerate
          progress towards realizing associated biotechnological opportunities,
          this program supports high risk/high return research devoted to developing,
          adapting, and exploiting systems analysis frameworks and data acquisition
          systems that hold promise for more efficiently relating genome- and
          environment-level data to a manifested phenotype.&#160;</p>
        <p>The phenotype results from the interactions among numerous gene products
          and environmental factors, and so is best understood from a systems
          viewpoint.&#160;&#160;The construction and testing of quantitative
          frameworks, in turn, will be enabled by the collaborative input of
          bioengineers, complex systems analysts, biologists, and workers from
          other fields to&#160;contend creatively with the hierarchical and nonlinear
          nature of cellular systems, while maintaining a focus on directing
          the research results towards developing and improving cell-based, biotechnological
          processes. These frameworks may involve the use of different system
          analysis tools (discrete math, differential equations, complex systems
          simulation) and model-database integration architectures. Moreover,
          the engineering design and performance space for quantitative investigation
          may extend &#160;far beyond the examples and circumstances provided
          by nature and, consequently, may involve unusual analysis frameworks
          and phenotype drivers.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Highly defined biological systems will be required for developing
          such quantitative frameworks.&#160;&#160;&#160;At this juncture, unicellular
          or engineered unicellular organisms are perhaps the most desirable
          subjects for developing quantitative frameworks, as more rapid progress
          is possible when substantial genomic data are combined with the ability
          to more completely define phenotype as well as identify environmental
          conditions under which proliferation and gene expression occur.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Opportunities and needs also exist regarding data acquisition systems
          (e.g. arrays, two-dimensional gels). It would be beneficial, for example,
          to move beyond the output of data in ratio form so that the information
          can be more immediately used for model building or testing. New approaches
          that yield information that can, for example, link gene array, proteomic,
          and metabolic data sets in the context of understanding metabolic and
          signal transduction pathways are also important research objectives.</p>
        <p>Additional information on QSB is available at the following web site,
          which reports on a QSB Workshop held at the National Science Foundation
          (NSF) on September 13-14, 2000:</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.wtec.org/qsb/">http://www.wtec.org/qsb/</a></p>
        <p>Three&#160;grant competitions for QSB have already been held (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf0137">NSF
          01-37</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf02026">NSF

          03-517</a>).&#160;&#160;The first competition
          resulted in 11 Awards (5 exploratory and 6 standard Awards) with a
          total funding level of $3.1M, the second competition resulted in 7
          Awards (2 exploratory and 5 standard Awards) with a total funding of
          $2.5M, and&#160;the third competition resulted in 10 Awards (1 exploratory
          and 9 standard Awards) with a total funding of $4.2 M.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

        <p><strong>OVERALL GOALS &amp; SCOPE</strong></p>
        <p>The ultimate goals of the QSB initiative are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Predict cellular physiological function across a range of conditions
            and cell types and thus enable engineering of bioprocess behavior
            from knowledge about genomes.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Gain a more comprehensive interpretation of genomic data.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Unify and advance the understanding of the design principles of
            biological systems and options for genomic and metabolic systems.&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Develop software modules to perform computer simulation of cellular
            processes.&#160;&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These goals must be approached using non-reductionist modeling approaches
          and improved data acquisition and integration methods.&#160;</p>
        <p>In a typical case, it is likely that work supported by this initiative
          will use as components a set of known gene products, or sequences,
          whether coding or non-coding, a set of regulators, and/or a number
          of metabolites and pathways, and connect them in a fashion that would
          elucidate aspects of their integrated function, coordination, regulation,
          and role in phenotype determination. The detailed analysis of molecular
          mechanisms (e.g. ligand binding, protein-protein interactions, and
          molecular recognition) falls within the scope of QSB if the task is
          imbedded in an integrated assessment that shows promise for enhancing
          understanding at the intact system level.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the identification and characterization of
          individual genomic or metabolic components is of extreme importance.
          However, the scope of QSB emphasizes the quantitative interactions
          between such components and the consequent phenotype. Thus, research
          focused on molecular component characterization falls outside the scope
          of QSB. The scope of the QSB initiative also does not embrace a focus
          on sequencing, genomic data acquisition, or statistical mining. Proposals
          may include such methodologies only in conjunction with other substantive
          system modeling tasks. Proposals on new screening strategies and assay
          technologies are encouraged if they demonstrate novelty and also explicitly
          address how quantitative modeling efforts will be enabled and pursued.&#160;</p>
        <p><strong>TOPICAL COMPONENTS</strong></p>
        <p>A responsive proposal should describe an overarching issue and present
          a solution path involving system analysis and/or experimentation. Some
          of the general topics of interest include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanism-based, quantitative frameworks (<i>in</i>&#160;<i>silico</i>&#160;biotechnology)
            for assessing phenotypes based on genomic information and environmental
            factors.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Improved experimental screening methods or assays to provide a
            basis for building and testing quantitative frameworks.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Software tools to create computer models of cellular processes
            to allow investigators to explore research issues that are not currently
            amenable to direct experimentation.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Development and analysis of mathematical and statistical models
            of cellular processes to allow investigators to explore research
            issues that are not currently amenable to direct experimentation.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As described above, analysis and experimentation should be viewed
          as linked even if a proposed project emphasizes modeling versus experimentation.&#160;&#160;The
          following questions provide examples of some issues of interest. The
          examples are not meant to be inclusive; other integrative questions
          and the technological implications of the answers also merit investigation.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the design principles or motifs that govern gene and/or
            metabolic regulation that can ultimately form the basis for bioprocess
            analysis and design?&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Is it possible to establish a catalog of regulatory "units" or "modules" that
            can be assembled for the prediction and understanding of larger regulatory
            circuits?&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>How is system performance versus robustness/adaptability managed
            and traded off, and does this limit ultimate bioprocess efficiency?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
          <li>Concerning bioprocess control and repeatability, how do properties
            emerge as a result of initial values, genomic repertoire, and nonlinear
            interactions among system components, and what is the role of degeneracy?&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Quantitative Frameworks</strong>: Modeling work can be anticipatory
          or hypothesis-driven in that one need not delay the development of
          models until all necessary data are acquired.&#160;&#160;&#160;The
          fusion of different computational tools is highly encouraged as a means
          of addressing physicochemical and informational hierarchies, molecular
          biology, and other salient system features. Such frameworks may combine
          differential equations, discrete mathematics, and other system analysis
          tools. Other formalism issues such as revisiting how models connect
          with data bases to enable the prediction of emergent, branching, and
          other properties are of interest.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>All models should be appropriately tested with respect to robustness
          and sensitivities to changes in parameters.&#160;&#160;The models should
          produce testable results and also guide the development of new experiments.
          It is desirable that the proposed program include model testing and
          validation in collaboration with bench scientists.</p>
        <p><strong>Screening &amp; Data Acquisition Systems</strong>: Methods
          and strategies offering increased reliability, reproducibility, and
          resolution for gene expression and protein profiling are required.&#160;&#160;Such
          data must have the attribute of being more directly useable for quantitative
          model development and/or testing. In particular, moving beyond ratio
          analysis is needed where, for example, the information provided is
          in the form of molecules per cell, concentration, etc. This may involve
          inventing new methods or improving the output from existing methods.
          Apart from screening systems, new biomolecular screening strategies
          also need to be developed that allow for the link between gene expression
          (e.g. gene chip) and proteomic data to be more firmly established.
          Examples include new assay strategies for ascertaining metabolite profiles
          and second messenger levels.&#160;</p>
        <strong>Subject Systems</strong>: Unicellular or engineered unicellular
        organisms are viewed as the most desirable research subjects for progress
        to be made in the near term while also providing a platform for investigating
        other biological systems. The genome of the organism (or strain) need
        not be totally sequenced if the project entails using that organism for
        proving the concept behind a new screening or assay approach. However,
        the data-acquisition advances must have high potential for being applicable
        to organisms with completed genome sequences. Additionally, researchers
        must be cognizant of potential limitations when focusing on an organism
        to insure that valid conclusions are drawn and the results are not overly
        extrapolated. Biological modularity and common design-property relationships
        may exist, yet there may also be interesting variations when an organism's
        natural environmental niche versus a synthetic bioprocess (or laboratory)
        environment is considered. Therefore, some careful advance thinking and
        interpretative flexibility are desirable attributes of research programs,
        especially when delineating design rules and general patterns that comprise
        the goals.&#160; </div>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P>
      <P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB
        97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit
        review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
        criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain
        programs and activities. </P>
      <P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements
          Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces
          the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review
          of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its
          internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria
          are addressed when making funding decisions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P>
      <P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P>
      <P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P>
      <UL>
        <B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </UL>
      <P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</P>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <P>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <A id=rev_meth_txt name=rev_meth_txt></A>Ad Hoc Review
        followed by Panel Review. </P>
      <P>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</P>
      <P>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</P>
      <P>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</P>

      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
        special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
        thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
        expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
        any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
        the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
        conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal
        Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement
        or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements. </p>

      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,

      <h3>IX. OTHER PROGRAMS OF INTEREST</h3>
      <p> The NSF <i>Guide to Programs</i> is a compilation of funding for research
        and education in science, mathematics, and engineering. The NSF <i>Guide
        to Programs</i> is available electronically at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gp">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gp</a>.
        General descriptions of NSF programs, research areas, and eligibility
        information for proposal submission are provided in each chapter. </p>
      <p> Many NSF programs offer announcements or solicitations concerning specific
        proposal requirements. To obtain additional information about these requirements,
        contact the appropriate NSF program offices. Any changes in NSF's fiscal
        year programs occurring after press time for the <i>Guide to Programs</i> will
        be announced in the NSF <a 
  href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin">E-Bulletin</a>, which is updated daily
        on the NSF Website at <a   href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin">https://www.nsf.gov/home/ebulletin</a>,
        and in individual program announcements/solicitations. Subscribers can

      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
        proposals.</p>

      <h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
      <P>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited
        under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as
        amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection
        with the selection of qualified proposals; project reports submitted
        by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within
        the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be
        disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the
        proposal review process; to applicant institutions/grantees to provide
        or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions,
        or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts,
        volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned
        work; to other government agencies needing information as part of the
        review process or in order to coordinate programs; and to another Federal
        agency, court or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding
        if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators
        may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates
        to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems
        of Records, NSF-50, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated
        Records," 63 Federal Register 267 (January 5, 1998), and NSF-51, "Reviewer/Proposal
        File and Associated Records," 63 Federal Register 268 (January 5, 1998).
        Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and
        complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving
        an award.</P>
      <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
        respond to an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control
        number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public
        reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average
        120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
        Send comments regarding this burden estimate and any other aspect of
        this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
        burden, to: Suzanne Plimpton, Reports Clearance Officer, Division of
        Administrative Services, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
