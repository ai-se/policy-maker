          <LI><b>I am a little unsure about the difference between the Leadership and the Institutional Transformation Awards.  Could you give me some clarification?</b></LI>
        </OL> 
        <OL TYPE="A">
          <P>
          <LI>The Institutional Transformation awards require cost sharing, evaluation 
            and dissemination mechanisms, and negotiation with NSF. The expectation 
            is that institutions receiving these awards will initiate and sustain 
            organizational change. These are likely to be large, complex efforts. 
            The Leadership awards are probably most appropriate for smaller-scale 
            efforts, or for use by an individual or organization that has developed 
            some "home grown" programs that need funding to scale-up and institutionalize. 
            Leadership awards are also designed to provide support for individuals 
            to maintain an active research program and/or laboratory while the 
            individual is working on activities that target increased participation 
            and advancement of women faculty members.<br>
            <br>
            In general, Leadership Awards will support work that has systemic 
            impact. Leadership in meeting the challenges of increasing the number 
            of women in science and engineering takes many forms, including for 
            example, development and implementation of new strategies and programs 
            that enable women with advanced degrees or equivalent training to 
            establish successful academic careers and advance into positions of 
            academic leadership; programs to encourage the adoption of best practices 
            for advancing faculty development among women in science or engineering, 
            or programs for mentoring scientists through to senior professorships 
            and senior academic administrative and leadership positions. </LI>

          <LI>Leadership Awards are intended to recognize the contributions made to date by 
organizations and/or individuals who have enabled the increased participation and advancement of women in academic and engineering careers, as well as to enable awardees to sustain, intensify and initiate new activities designed to make further progress.  Leadership Awards are not intended to be a substitute for seeking core research funding from NSF's research programs to fund an individual's current research.  The NSF has long-established methods to allow applicants to seek funds via competitive proposal submission; one of these would be the appropriate avenue for obtaining research support.

          <LI>Leadership Awards are intended to support academic institutions
