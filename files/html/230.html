IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES        </h3>
        <p>The previous IRNC solicitation (14-554) issued in 2014 addressed research and education network connectivity between the U.S. and Asia and the Americas. That solicitation also established award activities supporting open exchange points in the US, centralized network operation center (NOC) activities and advanced measurement. That solicitation explicitly stated that U.S.-Europe/Africa network connectivity community needs would be addressed in a future solicitation. This solicitation targets that area. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide </em>(PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">NSF 16-1</a>), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after January 25, 2016. Please be advised that proposers who opt to submit prior to January 25, 2016, must also follow the guidelines contained in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">NSF 16-1</a>.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        <p>The United States research and education (R&amp;E) community communicates, cooperates, and collaborates with colleagues in the global community. Members of this community access remote instruments, data, and computational resources located throughout the world, often as part of international collaborations. Similarly, major NSF investments in large-scale science and engineering facilities located both inside and outside the United States are utilized by multi-national research and education collaborations. To support such activities, NSF solicits proposals for International Research Network Connections (IRNC).</p>
        <p>NSF made a series of awards in 2014-2015 (pursuant to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=503382&amp;ods_key=nsf14554" target="_blank">NSF 14-554</a>) supporting continued multi-gigabit high-performance international trans-oceanic network connectivity between the U.S. and other parts of the world, specifically Asia and the Americas. This solicitation addresses science-driven needs for connectivity to Europe and Africa.</p>
        <p>NSF expects to make 1-2 awards to link U.S. research networks with peer networks in Europe and Africa and leverage existing international network connectivity. High-performance network connections funded by this program are intended to support science and engineering research and education applications, and preference will be given to solutions that provide the best economies of scale and demonstrate the ability to support the largest communities of interest with the broadest services. The funded project(s) will join other awards made in 2015 in the program in assisting the U.S. research and education community by enabling state-of-the-art international network services and access to increased collaboration and data services. Through extended international network connections, additional research and production network services will be enabled, complementing those currently offered or planned by domestic research networks. </p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
        <p>In 2012 NSF began an effort called the International Research and Education Network Initiative (IREN) Initiative to globally develop and coordinate future strategy in international research and education (R&amp;E) networking. An early result of these efforts in 2013 was a short document, co-developed with the European Commission, that provided a concise set of guiding principles for international networking. The full document can be found at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://fasterdata.es.net/nsf-iren">http://fasterdata.es.net/nsf-iren/</a>. These principles, paraphrased below, apply in full to this program.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Coordination Statement: Support global research and education communities by funding globally interoperable networked infrastructures, coordinated innovative services and human network community building. </em><em>This will be achieved through global coordination, planning, execution, and governance through appropriate coordination of governance bodies, and coordinated investments.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Guiding Principles:</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Open exchange points: "policy-light" operation of open exchange points allowing for bi-lateral peering at all layers.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Open shared transit: utilization of the appropriated network capacity will be open to the largest R&amp;E communities possible, including for transit.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- End-to-end interoperability: end-to-end visibility &amp; interoperability across network links and paths, and extended to end systems, is encouraged.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Close partnership with R&amp;E Networks: close coordination and engagement with the community of R&amp;E Networks.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Resilience: network resources will be configured and engineered in a way limiting or eliminating single point of failure and ensuring physical and logical path and route diversity.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Regional development: commitment to the concept of aggregation of demand at the regional level.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Technology agnostic: operators of international R&amp;E network infrastructure are open to different technology architectures.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>- Open innovation: coordinated development and adoption of advanced services at intra-domain, inter-domain and user levels</em>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>A. General Information</strong></p>
        <p>The infrastructure and associated services proposed in response to this solicitation must address U.S. research and education needs with respect to international collaboration and communication that advance science and engineering. The science that will be enabled by the proposal should be detailed. Plans for meeting the evolving service needs of the research and education community should also be described.</p>
        <p>Because of the nature and geographic extent of the efforts involved, interested parties may choose to form consortia that can work together to provide the needed services. Consortia may consist of any number of U.S. and foreign, profit and not-for-profit entities. Awards resulting from this solicitation will be made to the eligible lead U.S. organizations. Usage of any funded connectivity under this program is required to be dedicated to academic science and engineering communities in support of global research and education activities.</p>
        <p>The highest priority is enabling and enhancing communication and collaboration between the U.S. and international science and engineering research and education communities. A key ingredient of networked global scientific collaboration continues to be high-capacity, high-performance network links between the U.S. and other regions of the world. The availability of limited resources means that preference will be given to solutions providing the most efficient economies of scale and demonstrating the ability to link the largest communities of interest with the broadest services. Proposals should describe how this will be accomplished over a four-year period.</p>
        <p>NSF is also interested in innovative and forward-looking approaches to promote the development of a rational global network architecture. In this regard, proposals should address the question of how their international links will become an integral component of the global science and engineering research and education network environment and how they will fit into a rational global network architecture. For example, solutions that offer partnering and engineering incentives to foreign connection points to share circuits or encourage the establishment of national or regional distributed exchange points may be considered.</p>
        <p>Proposals should describe how the design complements, and improves, existing trans-Atlantic network infrastructure dedicated to the R&amp;E community. If direct submarine cable routes between the U.S. and Africa are either unavailable or unfeasible, proposals should describe the network paths enabled by their designs in support of research and education collaborations with countries and partners in Africa. Proposals should consider the IREN principles listed above in their network designs. In addition to the description of the initial technologies and equipment to be employed, proposals should outline how the proposed IRNC connectivity should evolve and discuss plans for introducing new networking technologies, equipment, and services.</p>
        <p>Proposals are encouraged to weigh current network traffic demand and existing R&amp;E network paths and physical connections against future estimated needs and to consider proposing one or more coordinated 100Gbps circuits, depending on geography, availability, and demand.</p>
        <p>Proposals must establish and augment high-capacity R&amp;E network connectivity between the U.S. and Europe and/or Africa. Network Operation Center (NOC) and advanced measurement services have been funded separately through 2015 IRNC awards. </p>
        <p><strong>B. Project Description Elements</strong></p>
        <p>The Project Description for all proposals, which can be up to 15 pages in length, should address the following elements:</p>
        <p>(1) scientific research and education needs for the proposed bandwidth;</p>
        <p>(2) a topology including a logical and physical landing point identified on U.S. soil, and how the proposed connectivity complements existing research and education (R&amp;E) networking paths and capacity;</p>
        <p>(3) technologies and services supported in layers 1-3 and interoperability plans;</p>
        <p>(4) how the proposed activities reflect the IREN principles described above; and</p>
        <p>(5) a project plan, including a schedule for capacity availability, network engineering activities in coordination with existing R&amp;E network connections and infrastructure where relevant, and existing IRNC program funded activities, especially NOC and measurement.</p>
        <p>NOC services should not be included in proposals. Advanced network measurement services, beyond capabilities required to address impact metrics and normative Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based passive measurement, should not be included in proposals. 2015 IRNC awards were made in 2015 to support NOC and advanced measurement functions for the IRNC program. Proposals in this solicitation are expected to address plans to work closely, and coordinate with, these other awards. </p>
        <p>Letters of commitment, submitted as <strong>supplementary documents</strong>, should be included for all international partners in a proposal, and are encouraged to specify the partners' views of the relationship with, and value of, the proposed project, and the nature of their interactions. Letters of support from third parties are limited to 8.</p>
        <p>Budgets should include pricing information for circuit or wavelength spectrum costs and associated port and cross-connect fees with supporting documentation.</p>
        <p>NSF expects to make 1-2 awards at up to $900,000 total per year for up to 4 years, subject to the availability of funds. </p>
        <p><strong>Experimental Europe/Africa Open Exchange Point for Network Innovation</strong></p>
        <p>Proposals may choose to include an additional element: the design and deployment of an experimental network exchange point serving explicit scientific collaborations between the United States and scientific collaborators in Europe and Africa. This experimental open exchange point represents next-generation integration and provision of limited computational and storage resources embedded in the network path and integrated into the network physically at an exchange point. Proposals including this experimental exchange point element should describe how the work relates to the connectivity described and planned elsewhere in the proposal. Proposals should identify specific U.S.-Africa and/or U.S.-Europe scientific collaborations that they intend to support with this experimental cyberinfrastructure, and the nature of interaction and support for integrated scientific workflows associated with those projects.  </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <p>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>
        <h4><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></h4>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate. </p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong> </p>
        <p>Proposals will be evaluated with careful attention to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The expected impact of the proposed international networking activities, either directly or indirectly, across the NSF community;</li>
          <li>The expected level of production quality in resulting capabilities made available to the NSF community; and</li>
          <li>The experience and record of the PI team in delivering reliable, robust, dependable, and state-of-the-art capabilities in international R&amp;E networking. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
        <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation. </p>
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
         C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
