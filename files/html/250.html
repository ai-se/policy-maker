        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
        
          <blockquote>
            <p>NSF currently supports 25 LTER research sites and, through this solicitation, invites proposals to establish three (3) new LTER sites. Research proposals should address questions in one of two broad ecosystems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arid/semi-arid ecosystems: The Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) anticipates support and management of one (1) new site with a focus on arid or semi-arid ecosystems. The location of the research site for proposals submitted to develop a new arid/semi-arid ecosystem LTER must be within the United States, including its territories and protectorates.</li>
              <li>Ocean/coastal ocean ecosystems: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) anticipates support and management of two (2) new sites that focus on ocean or coastal ocean ecosystems; defined as ecological systems from the shoreline outward on continental shelves and including the Laurentian Great Lakes, Congressionally defined as interior oceans. Preference will be given to proposals developing a new ocean/coastal ocean ecosystem LTER site located within the United States, including its territories and protectorates, but other locations are not precluded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address ecological questions that cannot be resolved with short-term observations or experiments, NSF established the Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) in 1980. Two components differentiate LTER research from projects supported by other NSF programs: 1) the research is located at specific sites chosen to represent major ecosystem types or natural biomes; and 2) it emphasizes the study of ecological phenomena over long periods of time based on data collected in five core areas. The five core areas of long-term data collection are: 1) patterns and controls of primary production, 2) spatial and temporal population dynamics and food web interactions, 3) patterns and controls of organic matter accumulation and decomposition, 4) patterns of inorganic inputs and movements of nutrients, and 5) patterns and frequency of disturbances. The LTER program provides a unique opportunity for researchers to obtain an integrated, holistic understanding of ecosystems that is not possible through individual, short-term awards.</p>
            <p>Research at LTER sites must test important, current ecological theories and significantly advance understanding of the long-term dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems. It often integrates multiple disciplines and, through cross-site interactions, examines patterns or processes over broad spatial scales. Recognizing that the value of long-term data extends beyond use at any individual site, NSF requires that data collected by all LTER sites be made broadly accessible.</p>
            <p>The LTER program is a multi-disciplinary, cross-Foundation effort supported by the Division of Environmental Sciences (DEB), the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), and the Division of Polar Programs (PLR).</p>

          Award Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Anticipated Type of Award:</strong> Continuing Grant </p>
        <p><strong>Estimated Number of Awards:</strong> 3 </p>
        <p><strong>Anticipated Funding Amount:</strong> $3,154,000</p>
        
        <p>$3,154,000 is the approximate total for the first year of funding. Budgets for a new arid or semi-arid site should not exceed $900,000 per year. New marine sites can request up to $1,127,000 annually. The expectation is that marine sites will be funded at a higher level than the terrestrial site due to increased costs associated with oceanic field research. Successful projects will be funded for six years. Annual budgets must be well justified and should include $16,000 to support two Research Experiences for Undergraduate students and $24,000 for a LTER Schoolyard program. All awards are contingent on availability of funds.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        
          <p>All ecological communities and ecosystems face long-term change. Identifying the nature of these changes and the mechanisms or processes driving them requires the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data over long periods of time. The LTER program provides a unique opportunity for researchers to obtain an integrated, holistic understanding of ecosystems that is not possible through individual, short-term awards. LTER research is located at specific sites chosen to represent major ecosystem types or natural biomes and it emphasizes the study of phenomena over long periods of time based on data collected in five core areas: 1) patterns and controls of primary production, 2) spatial and temporal population dynamics and food web interactions, 3) patterns and controls of organic matter accumulation and decomposition, 4) patterns of inorganic inputs and movements of nutrients, and 5) patterns and frequency of disturbances. Research at LTER sites must test important, current ecological theories and significantly advance understanding of the long-term dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems. Existing projects often include integrative, cross-site research.</p>
          <p>Over thirty years of LTER research have produced unique and valuable knowledge about ecological change in response to natural and human influences. LTER research has advanced the field of ecology and helped to provide the empirical data needed to forecast change. It has also advanced understanding of continental-scale processes, through cross-site analyses of ecological change. At some sites, social scientists have been engaged to examine questions of socio-ecological connections among organisms, biological processes, and the abiotic environment.</p>
          <p>The LTER Program faces new demands for long-term research as it enters its fourth decade. Long-term data are necessary to advance our understanding of complex biological systems, important ecological processes that are context-dependent and non-linear, ecological and evolutionary processes that interact continually through feedbacks, and the effects of ongoing climate and environmental change that are currently unknown. These are a few of the frontiers particularly appropriate for LTER research.</p>
          <p>To enhance the scope and disciplinary breadth of the LTER Program, NSF invites proposals to establish three new LTER sites. Research proposals submitted to this solicitation competition should address questions in one of two broad ecosystems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arid/semi-arid ecosystems: The Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) anticipates support and management of one (1) new site with a focus on arid or semi-arid ecosystems. Arid lands are experiencing rapid changes due to climate, land use, fire, and shifting biotic interactions. Reduced productivity, shifts in vegetation structure, changes in plant-soil feedbacks, and the importance of legacy effects underscore the complex interactions responsible for dynamics of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Ocean/coastal ocean ecosystems: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) anticipates support and management of two (2) new sites that focus on ocean or coastal ocean ecosystems, here meaning ecological systems from the shoreline outward on continental shelves and including the Laurentian Great Lakes, Congressionally defined as interior oceans. The LTER program recognizes the critical need to understand the resilience and sustainability of coastal ocean systems in the face of environmental change, including activity by humans.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Evaluation of proposals will place priority on: a) evidence of an intellectual framework that links diverse studies through explicit predictions; b) testing core ecological principles or concepts; c) promoting an integrated understanding of how processes interact across components of an ecosystem, including the five core areas mentioned above; d) identification of a site that convincingly characterizes a major biome; and e) an investigative team with the expertise to manage and conduct a cohesive research program.</p>
          <p>The LTER Program comprises a collaborative network of over 1,200 scientists and students investigating ecological processes over long temporal and broad spatial scales. The LTER network governance expands the opportunities and capabilities of individual sites to promote synthesis and comparative research across sites. Additional information about the LTER Program and network activities can be obtained from the LTER homepage at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.lternet.edu">http://www.lternet.edu</a>.</p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
        
          <p>The LTER program enables research to advance the understanding of long-term ecological dynamics, processes, and phenomena. It provides researchers a unique opportunity to obtain an integrated, holistic understanding of populations, communities, and ecosystems that is not possible through individual, short-term awards.</p>
          <p>Current LTER projects or sites each address a suite of integrated questions that test major ecological theories or concepts. These questions arise from ongoing analyses of long-term data and demand study on decadal time scales. The research seeks to achieve a mechanistic understanding of biological responses to past and present environmental changes at multiple scales, and to use this understanding to predict ecological, evolutionary, and &ndash; if appropriate &ndash; socio-ecological responses to environmental change. As described above, each site collects long-term data in five core areas, and many also implement manipulative, long- and short-term experiments. Results from this research significantly advance an integrated understanding of site-specific dynamics. They also provide opportunities for cross-site or synthetic research.</p>
          <p>All current LTER sites have developed educational activities appropriate for all levels of learning. They execute thorough data management plans that include timelines for data release, publication of discovery-level metadata, and online access for all core data through the LTER Network Information System. NSF recognizes that human decisions, behavior, and actions may contribute to LTER research. New proposals may elect to include social science research if it helps to advance or to understand key, conceptually-motivated ecological questions.</p>
          <p>The LTER program supports 25 sites that examine Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems (Arctic LTER, McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER, Palmer LTER), forest ecosystems (Andrews Forest LTER, Bonanza Creek LTER, Coweeta LTER, Harvard Forest LTER, Hubbard Brook LTER, Luquillo LTER), urban ecosystems (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, Central Arizona-Phoenix LTER), coastal ecosystems (Florida Coastal Everglades LTER, Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER, Plum Island Ecosystems LTER, Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, Virginia Coastal Reserve LTER), marine ecosystems (California Current Ecosystem LTER, Moorea Coral Reef LTER), grassland and prairie ecosystems (Konza Prairie LTER, Cedar Creek Ecosystem LTER, Sevilleta LTER), agroecosystems (Kellogg Biological Station LTER), alpine ecosystems (Niwot Ridge LTER), arid land ecosystems (Jornada Basin LTER), and freshwater ecosystems (North Temperate Lakes LTER).</p>
          <p>NSF invites proposals to establish three new LTER sites in order to enhance the scope and disciplinary breadth of the LTER Program and to complement research carried out at current sites. Research proposals submitted to this solicitation competition should address questions in one of two broad ecosystems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arid/semi-arid ecosystems: The Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) anticipates support and management of one (1) new site with a focus on arid or semi-arid ecosystems.
              <ul>
                <li>Almost one third of the total land area of the world is classified as arid or as dryland, based on the definitions below. These environments are extremely diverse in terms of their land forms, soils, fauna, flora, water balances, and human activities. Arid lands are experiencing rapid changes due to climate, land use, fire, and shifting biotic interactions. Reduced productivity, shifts in vegetation structure, changes in plant-soil feedbacks, and the importance of legacy effects underscore the complex interactions responsible for dynamics of arid and semi-arid ecosystems</li>
                <li>For the purposes of this solicitation, semi-arid ecosystems are defined as those for which annual precipitation varies from 300-600 to 700-800 millimeters (11.81 &ndash; 31.5 inches), with summer rains, and from 200-250 to 450-500 millimeters (7.9 &ndash; 19.7 inches, with winter rains. Native vegetation is represented by a variety of species, such as grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, half-shrubs, shrubs and trees. Arid ecosystems experience highly variable rainfall, with annual amounts ranging between 100 and 300 millimeters (3.94 &ndash; 11.8 inches). Vegetation is generally sparse, represented by annual and perennial grasses and other herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and small trees. Arid or dryland climate is characterized by significant diurnal fluctuation in temperatures. Semi-arid and arid ecosystems occur in tropical, temperate, and high-latitude climatic zones. The location of the research site for proposals submitted to develop a new arid/semi-arid ecosystem LTER must be within the United States, including its territories and protectorates.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ocean/coastal ocean ecosystems: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) anticipates support and management of two (2) new sites that focus on ocean or coastal ocean ecosystems, here meaning ecological systems from the shoreline outward on continental shelves and including the Laurentian Great Lakes, Congressionally defined as interior oceans. The LTER program recognizes the critical need to understand the resilience and sustainability of ocean or coastal ocean ecosystems in the face of environmental change, including activity by humans. Investing in additional ocean or coastal ocean LTER sites that address nationally important ecological and sustainability issues in marine systems requires long-term studies and observation. Presently there are eight marine sites. The last competition for establishing new LTER sites was in 2003 and resulted in establishment of the Moorea Coral Reef LTER and the California Current Ecosystem LTER. Preference will be given to proposals developing a new ocean/coastal ocean ecosystem LTER site located within the United States, including its territories and protectorates, but other locations are not precluded.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposals submitted to this competition must support the general mission of the LTER Program, focusing on site-specific questions that promote an integrated understanding of how a particular ecosystem is structured and functions. The research should be innovative and justify the need for long-term support. A new LTER site should conduct hypothesis-driven, long-term research that is coupled with short-term mechanistic studies to derive an understanding of long-term dynamics. Modeling efforts are important and should be discussed in detail where appropriate.</p>
          <p>The research proposed should emphasize major ecological processes and questions or hypotheses that will advance current understanding of arid- or semi-arid and ocean or coastal ocean ecosystems. It should seek to understand the predominant causes of ecological variability and long-term change, and how populations, communities, and ecosystems respond to this change. Research that extends the traditional ecological disciplines represented at ongoing LTER sites by incorporating elements of evolutionary or physiological ecology, for example, are encouraged.</p>
          <p>The following elements are encouraged in proposals for new LTER sites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an unifying conceptual framework, based on key ecological theories, that integrates the questions and the research activities (e.g., sampling, experiments, modeling) proposed;</li>
            <li>development of conceptual, analytical, or numerical models to guide the research;</li>
            <li>inter-disciplinary, process-oriented research that is coordinated among investigators;</li>
            <li>experimental studies across a range of appropriate and manageable spatial and temporal scales;</li>
            <li>plans for documenting, archiving, and disseminating research data in accordance with current LTER standards(see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://lternet.edu">http://lternet.edu</a>);</li>
            <li>describe the domain of the proposed project that is adequate to outline the larger biome or region that would be characterized and to justify the site chosen as appropriate for new, long-term ecological research;</li>
            <li>evidence of a research team with the expertise required to accomplish the proposed research.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This solicitation will establish new LTER projects or sites. A proposal may be submitted for a site for which long-term data exist or for a site that requires an entirely new effort. Use of existing federal and state facilities, and collaboration with other long-term research sites or programs are encouraged. Prospective investigators may wish to contact current LTER Principal Investigators to learn more about the structure and management of an LTER site.</p>
          <p>Review Process: A two-stage review process will be used for the opportunities described above.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Preliminary Proposals: All proposers must submit a preliminary proposal that outlines the major goals of the project including the components described below. Preliminary proposals typically will be reviewed by a panel of outside experts. The Program Directors will communicate the decision to Invite/Do Not Invite full proposals via FastLane and those decisions will be based on the panel recommendations and additional portfolio considerations. Invite/Do not Invite decisions are binding.</li>
            <li>Full Proposals: Invited full proposals will receive panel review and ad hoc review at the discretion of the program as described in Section VI of this Solicitation. Full proposals that were not invited or that do not address one of the two ecosystems as defined above will be returned without review.</li>

          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
        
          <p>Budgets for a new arid or semi-arid site should not exceed $900,000 per year. New marine sites can request up to $1,127,000 annually. The expectation is that marine sites will be funded at a higher level than the terrestrial site due to increased costs associated with oceanic field research. Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds.</p>

Authors should develop and explain the conceptual framework that provides the unifying theme for the proposed research. Describe in some detail the long-term experiments, sampling, and sampling protocols that will be used and explain how each fits into the conceptual framework. Describe methods and data analyses in sufficient detail that the quality of these efforts can be critically evaluated by reviewers. In addition, describe any short-term, mechanistic experiments, empirical studies, sampling programs, or modeling efforts that will be conducted. Describe methods and planned analyses in detail and explain how these short-term studies fit into the conceptual framework. Likewise, proposed models or model development must be presented in sufficient detail to allow evaluation, including the model structure and how models account for sources of uncertainty. Conceptually integrate shorter-term efforts with proposed long-term studies. Outline any planned regional, cross-site, or other collaborative efforts involving the LTER network if they are not part of your core program. Close this section with a synthesis that ties together the proposed research activities.</li>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

        <p>The following additional merit review criteria will be used to evaluate the scientific goals of the proposed research:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>evidence of an intellectual framework that links diverse studies through explicit predictions;</li>
          <li>testing core ecological principles or concepts;</li>
          <li>promoting an integrated understanding of how processes interact across components of an ecosystem, including the five core areas: 1) patterns and controls of primary production, 2) spatial and temporal population dynamics and food web interactions, 3) patterns and controls of organic matter accumulation and decomposition, 4) patterns of inorganic inputs and movements of nutrients, and 5) patterns and frequency of disturbances;</li>
          <li>identification of a site that convincingly characterizes a major biome or region;</li>
          <li>a research team with the expertise to manage and conduct a cohesive research program.</li>
        </ol>

         <h4>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

        <p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. "NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>
        <p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism.

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
