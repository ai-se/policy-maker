<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3><div class="user_input"><p>The Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) is calling for the computing research community to unite in the establishment of a Computing Community Consortium (CCC). CISE will support the CCC as a community proxy responsible for facilitating the conceptualization and design of promising infrastructure-intensive projects identified by the computing research community to address compelling scientific &ldquo;grand challenges&rdquo; in computing. The CCC will ensure broad community engagement in the identification of compelling research agendas and in the subsequent identification and refinement of related shared use infrastructure requirements.</p>
<p>One of the first responsibilities of the CCC will be guiding the design of the Global Environment for Networking Innovations (GENI). As such, the process to be followed in maturing the GENI design might serve as a prototype for the identification and development of other infrastructure-intensive projects yet to be defined by the computing community. In fact, the CCC must play a broader role, serving a community proxy function that facilitates the conceptualization of other promising infrastructure-intensive projects designed to meet the computing community&rsquo;s broad research needs.</p>
<strong>About GENI. </strong>GENI is a facility concept being explored by the research community, including investigators from the disciplines supported by CISE. GENI is expected to complement ongoing CISE research investments in networking, distributed systems and other areas. It promises to increase the quality and quantity of experimental research outcomes supported by CISE, and to accelerate the transition of these outcomes into products and services to enhance economic competitiveness and secure the Nation's future.
<p>With CISE support, the computing community is already engaged in the conceptual design of the facility. A number of workshops have taken place and, under the leadership of a planning group, an initial strawman design has been completed. This design is being shared broadly for comment and is available for review at www.geni.net. CISE will support a number of town hall meetings in the spring of 2006 to gather community input that further informs and refines the facility design. Assuming the concept proves to be as promising as currently anticipated, GENI construction may be considered for funding from NSF's MREFC account.</p>
<p>When funded, the CCC will assume responsibility for guiding evolution of the GENI design on behalf of the research community, ensuring broad community participation in the GENI design process and identifying necessary pre-construction development activities. It is anticipated that the GENI design will be finalized during 2007.</p>
<p>Through a complementary competition to be initiated during calendar year 2006, CISE anticipates establishing a GENI Project Office to prepare for and support GENI construction and subsequent operations.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting NSF&rsquo;s MREFC Process.</strong> The design and development stages of large facility projects like GENI are described in NSF's <em>Guidelines for Planning and Managing the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction Account.</em> The CCC role in this process for GENI is summarized below.</p>
<p>    Preliminary Design and Readiness Stage: The CCC will be responsible for defining the scientific grand challenges to be addressed with GENI and for identifying the necessary infrastructure requirements. The CCC will define the GENI research agenda, and provide scientific leadership and guidance to the GENI Project Office (to be established this year) to ensure that the GENI design is fully compatible with this agenda. The GENI Project Office, with input from the CCC, will then: refine the Project Execution Plan; prepare a Project Development Plan that addresses major risks anticipated in the completion of project design and development activities and in the undertaking of construction; and develop a robust bottom-up budget estimate that can be transmitted with confidence to the NSF Director, the National Science Board, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress for inclusion in a future NSF budget request. A detailed description of the activities to be undertaken during the Preliminary Design/Readiness stage of GENI in preparation for a full Preliminary Design Review by an independent panel of experts is provided in the <em>Guidelines for Planning and Managing the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction Account.</em> With the successful review of the Preliminary Design and NSF management approval, the project will progress to the next stage - the Final Design Stage.</p>
<p>      Final Design Stage: During the Final Design Stage, the CCC will provide scientific leadership to the GENI Project Office in order to assist with the development and finalization of the scientific and technical requirements for GENI construction. Requirements include: delivery of designs, specifications and work scopes that will be competitively bid; refined bottom-up cost estimates and contingency estimates; development and delivery to NSF of a Project Management Control System for project technical and financial status reporting; successful prototyping of key technologies necessary for construction; finalization of commitments with academic, industry, interagency and international partners; and, submission of a complete Project Execution Plan for construction. The Final Design for GENI will be reviewed using NSF's merit review procedures. Following merit review and approval by the National Science Board, the CCC and the GENI Project Management Office will together produce a Final Design as defined in the document, <em>Guidelines for Planning and Managing the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction Account.</em></p>

<h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3><a name="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4><a name="reviewproc"></a>
<P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p><P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsb9772">(NSB 97-72)</a>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </p><P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=iin127">Important Notice 127</a>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding decisions.</p><P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p><P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p><P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p><UL><B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><BR>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</ul><UL><B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><BR>How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</ul><P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p><UL><I><B>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><BR>One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</ul><UL><I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><BR>Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</ul><UL><A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></a> <B>Additional Review Criteria</b>:<div>
    <p>Reviewers will be asked to comment explicitly on the issues discussed below, in the context of each proposal's Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>How well does the submitting organization represent the broad computing research community, particularly the academic and industrial communities including the communities supported by the CISE Directorate? Is the CCC sufficiently broad to play a community proxy role for CISE-related large-scale, systems-level infrastructure projects, including GENI?</li>
        <li>Is the organization and management structure sufficient to meet the project goals? Does the submitting organization have experience with similar types of projects? How qualified are the PI(s) and other named personnel to meet the project goals? Are the milestones and associated activities appropriate?</li>
        <li>Comment upon the quality and appropriateness of the proposed plans to provide scientific leadership guiding the evolution of the GENI design. Does the proposal present a comprehensive and timely approach to complete GENI design? Are the milestones and associated activities appropriate?</li>
        <li>How well does the proposing team understand the research and education priorities associated with GENI? Does the plan for development of the GENI final design include sufficient mechanisms for obtaining input from and consulting with the community?</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
</div>
 </ul><a name="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4> <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal.  <a id="rev_meth_oth_txt" name="rev_meth_oth_txt"></a>Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be reviewed using a combination of ad hoc, review panel, and/or site visits&#160;. </p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation, or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3><a name="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>
  Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants 
  Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are 
  declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division 
  administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the 
  reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section 
  VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)
</p> <a name="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<p>Consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-16, <i>Coordination of
    Geographic Information and Related Spatial Data Activities</i>, Fand the
    Federal Geographic Data Committee, all NSF awards that result in relevant
    geospatial data must be submitted to Geospatial One-Stop in accordance with
    the guidelines provided at: www.geodata.gov.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <u><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpm</a></u>.

<a name="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must 
  submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before 
  the end of the current budget period.  
</p><a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>

	<div class="user_input">
	The activities of the awardee will be monitored through brief monthly reports of financial and technical status by monthly teleconferences and quarterly progress reports. Reports should account for the activities of sub-awardees and major sub-contractors as well. In lieu of a fourth quarter report, an annual report on progress and plans will be submitted by the awardee to the cognizant Program Officer. NSF will provide the format for these reports within one month of the award date. Both quarterly and annual reports must address progress of the CCC regarding the duties outlined in the Solicitation.
</div>
 <p>
  Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final 
  project report.  Failure to provide final 
  technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs.  PIs 
  should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
  required data. 
</p>

<p>
PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. 
  This system permits electronic submission and updating of project reports, including 
  information on project participants (individual and organizational), activities and 
  findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions.   PIs will not be 
  required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in 
  earlier updates using the electronic system.
