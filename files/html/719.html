<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to enhance opportunities for collaborative activities between U.S. and foreign investigators. To realize this goal the Chemistry Division at NSF has partnered with the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation),&nbsp; the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of the United Kingdom and &nbsp;the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC).&nbsp; NSF Chemistry will accept collaborative research proposals in chemistry that establish new bilateral collaborations between U.S. investigators and investigators from Germany, United Kingdom or China.&nbsp; The proposals will be written in English.</p>
<p>The program seeks new and highly innovative 3-year collaborative projects
  that break new ground and demonstrate high level of synergy between the collaborating
  investigators.&nbsp; The program will not accept proposals for projects that
  were funded in the past or are currently funded by other funding sources. The
  program will also not accept proposals for projects that largely overlap or
  are closely related to research projects that are currently carried out in
  the collaborators&rsquo; laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed 3-year projects
  must be in areas that are supported by the NSF Division of Chemistry programs
  in Analytical and Surface Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry,
  Physical Chemistry and Theoretical and Computational Chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  program encourages the development and use of cyber infrastructure to facilitate
  communication, data sharing and remote control of instrumentation to increase
  the level of synergy of the proposed projects.&nbsp; The program also encourages
  meaningful participation of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates
  and junior investigators in the proposed international research collaborations
  since it seeks to develop a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering
  workforce.&nbsp; Research activities of U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral
  research associates and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented
  groups, in the laboratories of&nbsp;international collaborators should be an
  integral part of proposals submitted to this program.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to enhance opportunities for collaborative
  activities between U.S. and foreign investigators. To realize this goal the
  Chemistry Division at NSF has partnered with the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
  (DFG; German Research Foundation),&nbsp; the Engineering and Physical Sciences
  Research Council (EPSRC) of the United Kingdom and &nbsp;the National Science
  Foundation of China (NSFC).&nbsp; NSF Chemistry will accept collaborative research
  proposals in chemistry that establish new bilateral collaborations between
  U.S. investigators and investigators from Germany, United Kingdom or China.&nbsp; The
  proposals will be written in English. The program seeks new and highly innovative
  3-year collaborative projects that break new ground and demonstrate high level
  of synergy between the collaborating investigators.&nbsp; The program will
  not accept proposals for projects that were funded in the past or are currently
  funded by other funding sources. The program will also not accept proposals
  for projects that largely overlap or are closely related to research projects
  that are currently carried out in the collaborators&rsquo; laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
  proposed 3-year projects must be in areas that are supported by the NSF Division
  of Chemistry programs in Analytical and Surface Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry,
  Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry and Theoretical and Computational Chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  program encourages the development and use of cyber infrastructure to facilitate
  communication, data sharing and remote control of instrumentation to increase
  the level of synergy of the proposed projects.&nbsp; The program also encourages
  meaningful participation of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates
  and junior investigators in the proposed international research collaborations
  since it seeks to develop a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering
  workforce.&nbsp; Research activities of U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral
  research associates and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented
  groups, in the laboratories of&nbsp;international collaborators should be an
  integral part of proposals submitted to this program.&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S investigators
  will submit their proposals to NSF through Fastlane or Grants.gov.&nbsp;Foreign
  investigators will submit an identical proposal to the partnering international
  agency if required. NSF and the partnering international funding agencies will
  co-review and make joint funding decisions on these proposals. NSF awards will
  support the research of U.S. Investigators while the partnering international
  funding agencies will support the research of the collaborating foreign investigators.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
  (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
  of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
  criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
  and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to
    advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different
    fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct
    the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the
    prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore
    creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
    activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How
    well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports
    at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities
    where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators,
    and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education
    with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
    learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating
    Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities --
    is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is
    committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the two NSB-approved merit review criteria, the reviewers will be asked to specifically comment on whether the researchers demonstrated a clear need for international collaboration, the synergy between the collaborating groups, the collaboration plan between the investigators, and whether the proposed project provides meaningful international training experience to students and junior researchers. Foreign investigators will need to address the review criteria of their partnering agency.</p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. NSF Program Officers will utilize the ad-hoc review to evaluate the proposals. The partnering agency may also utilize a panel to review the proposals. The program officers in charge from NSF and the partnering agency will consider the advice of reviewers and panel to formulate a joint recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, Program Officers&nbsp; in charge from NSF and the partnering agency recommend to the cognizant NSF Division Director and the decision making bodies of the partnering agency whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the NSF Division Director and the decision making bodies of the partnering agency accept the Program Officers' recommendation. A proposal can only be funded if both NSF and the foreign partnering agency agree to fund it.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the US Principal Investigator/Project Director by the NSF Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the investigators will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important
  information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration
  Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a></p>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available
  through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project
  reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings,
  project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other
  specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter
  information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates
  using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes
  certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
