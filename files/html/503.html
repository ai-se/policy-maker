        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The ARI is a joint Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and National Science Foundation (NSF) program seeking novel cross-cutting research that will enhance the nation's ability to detect and interdict nuclear or radiological material outside of regulatory control, and otherwise help prevent nuclear or radiological attacks.&nbsp; This year's solicitation topics will encompass a range of subjects, with an emphasis on unconventional, multidisciplinary approaches to threat detection. A number of small to medium awards are intended in the areas of novel approaches to extremely low-cost threat detection, orthogonal and informatics approaches to threat detection, deterrence analytics, and advanced forensics techniques. A single large award is intended for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to shielded special nuclear material detection.&nbsp; Primary objectives of the ARI include advancing fundamental knowledge in the above areas and developing intellectual capacity in scientific fields relevant to long-term advances in these areas.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Proposals outside of the scope described in this solicitation will be returned without review.</p>
          <p>Research proposals specific to detection of biological, chemical, and conventional weapons are excluded from the scope of this solicitation, however approaches that consider explosives detection and nuclear or radiological materials detection are of interest.</p>

        <p>This Joint NSF/Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) solicitation is seeking proposals for new ideas and technologies that will significantly improve the Nation&rsquo;s capability to prevent nuclear or radiological attacks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been tasked to ensure that the United States remains safe from the illicit importation, development, procurement or use of a nuclear or radiological device. Critical to supporting this objective is cutting-edge research supporting the development of new capabilities for law enforcement and DHS components to aid detecting and interdicting these devices or component materials. Research is also required to improve capabilities to effectively respond from nuclear or radiological events, and specifically to support U.S. capabilities for effective and timely attribution.  In FY 2013 DNDO, a component of DHS, in partnership with the NSF will invest in leading-edge, fundamental research in science and technology that will support the successful detection and interdiction of nuclear and radiological threats through this Academic Research Initiative (ARI). Through this ARI, funding will be provided to establish and maintain aggressive research efforts at a number of academic institutions in a broad array of disciplines. These efforts will also help rebuild intellectual capacity in academic specialties relevant to the above objectives through the initiation and maintenance of long-term frontier research.</p>
        <p>This research and the research community that will be developed under the ARI are seen as critical to our Nation's ability to deploy increasingly effective homeland security capabilities.  This DNDO-NSF program will also coordinate with and leverage research currently underway in other areas of the federal government, to include research sponsored by DHS, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense, to further ARI program objectives.</p>
        <p>Radiological and nuclear threats have traditionally been detected through the deployment of radiation sensing technologies that detect the intrinsic radiological signatures of threat materials. Related sensors have been developed and deployed that enable identification of detected radiological materials. The sensitivity and specificity of these sensors and sensor systems determine what nuclear and radiological threats can be detected, at what distances or locations, and how quickly. Shielding or masking of threat materials can significantly impact their detectability.  Radiographic approaches can also be used to detect high atomic number materials and high mass density objects, and active interrogation techniques are being investigated that seek to extract or identify uniquely detectable signatures of special nuclear materials, even when shielded. ARI-funded research has previously focused on a wide array of activities intended to improve detection, identification and localization of threats through advanced neutron and gamma radiation sensing materials, passive radiation detection technology, active interrogation techniques, and other technical approaches that could result in high confidence detection and identification with minimal false alarms and minimal impact to the flow of commerce. </p>
        <p>Previous studies conducted by DNDO have highlighted a number of significant, long-term challenges in the deployment and operation of an effective Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA). The GNDA is a worldwide network of sensors, communications, and personnel, with the supporting information exchanges, programs, and protocols that serve to deter, detect, identify, and report on nuclear and radiological devices and materials out of regulatory control.  Many of these challenges cannot be easily overcome with existing or near-term technology developments.  Solutions to these challenges will need sustained, long-term and interdisciplinary research to develop the fundamental scientific and technological foundation required to make such capabilities effective and affordable. Additional perspective and background is provided in the report on the Workshop on the Role of the Nuclear Physics Research Community in Combating Terrorism, as well as by the Congressional Research Service on Detection of Nuclear Weapons and Materials at the following sites:</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>In order to effectively build on previous DNDO and NSF-supported research and address the program objectives discussed above, proposed research must fit into one or more of the following five topic areas:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Scientific and Engineering<strong> </strong>Approaches for Extremely Low-cost Monitoring for Radiological and Nuclear Threats</strong></p>
        <p>This topic seeks innovative research in science and engineering that can lead to considerably decreased capital investment and operational costs for routine monitoring and/or directed search for nuclear and radiological threat materials out of regulatory control. Approaches that support multiple modalities (choke point monitoring, wide area surveillance, and intelligence directed search) are preferred. Research could focus on techniques that radically decrease the cost of producing high-sensitivity and/or high- energy resolution radiation detection materials and systems, or consider the development of specific and sensitive radiation sensing materials and systems that are inherently extremely low cost. Very low cost detector materials that support both neutron and gamma detection, and that can be readily discriminated from gamma ray interactions are also of interest.  Materials can include, but are not limited to, scintillator and semiconductor materials.  Capital investment cost goals would be on the order of less than $100 per detector/sensor. Some sacrifice in detector performance may be acceptable to accommodate a significant decrease in associated cost. <span>Alternatively, completely novel approaches for threat monitoring that can be broadly utilized, are highly effective, and given to implementation at very low operational cost and burden are of interest.</span></p>
        <span>
        <p>All proposals should emphasize fundamental and early applied research that can potentially support dramatically new or improved capabilities to detect nuclear and radiological threats.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Deterrence Theory and Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>This research topic is seeking innovative proposals to develop and apply deterrence theory to help prevent the importation of nuclear or radiological weapons and materials into the United States. It shall address adversary decision making and uncertainty creation with respect to the design and capabilities of the GNDA, and shall include a methodology for quantifying the deterrence value (i.e. measures of effectiveness) of messaging strategies concerning the GNDA. The approach(es) should apply current state-of-art in informatics, game theory, intelligence, adversary analysis and behavior modeling, to enable the determination of the deterrence potential of current and proposed GNDA design and capabilities, with an emphasis on the domestic portion. Analytical approaches should encompass adversary cultural and ideological environments, beliefs, values, goals and objectives, modes of communication and messaging, and perceived and actual capabilities of various aspects of the GNDA. The theory and analytical approach should have the aim of informing homeland security deterrence strategy, the design of the GNDA, and should provide suggestions as to the most effective means to communicate deterrent messages to the adversary.</p>
        <p><strong>3. &nbsp; Scientific and Engineering of Threat Detection through Data Fusion, Informatics and/or Non-Radiological Signal/Signature Exploitation </strong></p>
        <p>Proposed research should explore how detection of nuclear/radiological threats can be definitively made or enhanced through the use of signals or signatures that may be collateral or orthogonal to conventional radiation sensing or radiographic methods.  Approaches may be either applied to routine monitoring at chokepoints (i.e. at border crossings or airport terminals), or applied to surge capabilities to discover nuclear/radiological materials within a wide area.&nbsp; Examples are approaches that would enhance detection through collection, fusion and analyses of all available information in a given application. Proposed approaches should clearly indicate the theoretical basis for the approach, and what information or data will be required to evaluate the theory. The proposed approaches must be specific to enabling the detection of nuclear/radiological material and/or the shielding that may be present around this material.  Excluded from this topic are investigations of novel signals/signatures directly associated with the intrinsic radiological signatures of threat materials (e.g. atmospheric fluorescence associated with ionizing radiation), but may include use of traditional radiological signatures in data-fusion approaches. Non-radiological signals may include thermal/infrared imaging, radar, electro-optical imaging, acoustics, gravimetrics or other potential sensing modalities, or utilization of other available data/information concerning the vehicle or container. </p>
        <p>All proposals should emphasize fundamental and early applied research that can potentially support dramatically new or improved capabilities to detect nuclear and radiological threats.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Science and Engineering of Nuclear Forensics</strong></p>
        <p>In general, the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) community is interested in advancements in separations or analyses of nuclear or radioactive materials that result in improvements in the speed, accuracy, and precision of determining the physical, chemical, radiological, micro-structural and/or morphological qualities of materials. We are seeking improvements in the quantification of micro-structural and morphology measurements of bulk uranium and plutonium in oxide and metal form.</p>
        <p>Basic studies are also needed to improve our understanding of how relevant stages of the nuclear fuel cycle create, persist, or modify discriminating material characteristics in the metal or oxide forms of uranium or plutonium. Activities should focus on identifying discriminating material characteristics (physical, chemical, isotopic) that help assess the recent process history and provenance of bulk uranium and plutonium materials produced in the enrichment, conversion to oxides, and conversion to metal stages of the nuclear fuel cycle; and developing simulations that predict material characteristics from parameterized processes.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Integrated Multi-disciplinary Approaches to Clear Objects from Nuclear Threats</strong></p>
        <p>Proposals under this topic should investigate integrated multidisciplinary approaches to verify with high confidence that special nuclear material (SNM), specifically weapons grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium, even when shielded, is not present in an object (e.g., truck, container, vessel, rail car).&nbsp; Although definitive detection of the presence of SNM is desired at all times, it is not necessary if (1) the selected approach can discriminate all but extremely rare objects; and (2) the actual, well-shielded and masked threat is never cleared.&nbsp; Research should emphasize highly mobile yet efficient and effective means of high volume, low-dose screening/scanning for nuclear threats with minimal operational burden.&nbsp;Modalities of interest include rapid screening/scanning of cargo or conveyances and vehicle chokepoint monitoring. Proposed research should include a detailed step-wise approach to investigating, assessing and recommending novel but practical and cost-effective concepts and approaches to detect and interdict threat materials in transit while expeditiously clearing innocent objects.&nbsp; Research should emphasize multi- and inter-disciplinary integrated approaches, for which radiation screening or radiographic scanning may be only components. The proposal should encompass multi-sensor / multi-data source analyses, data fusion, modeling and experimentation to support and defend the recommended approach.&nbsp; Successful approaches should dramatically enhance or support law enforcement and other front-line personnel&rsquo;s ability to detect, adjudicate and interdict nuclear threats when implemented in primary and secondary scanning roles.</p>
        <p>This ARI strongly encourages PIs to develop education initiatives that train graduate and undergraduate students in science and engineering disciplines supporting these topic areas. PIs are particularly encouraged to provide experiential opportunities that allow students to develop a deeper knowledge, expertise, and appreciation of these important areas (e.g., undergraduate research experiences for individual students or for multiple students through a program like NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites).  This program seeks to integrate research and education, which is a key objective NSF supports and promotes.</p>
        <p>Proposals should involve a program of innovative and potentially high-risk research with potential for high impact. Multi- or inter-disciplinary approaches are preferred.  The research must include the involvement of multiple graduate students and is encouraged to include undergraduate students as well as post-doctoral fellows.  Collaborations with National Laboratories including summer internships and other exchange of personnel are strongly encouraged but must be performed on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.</p>
        <p>All students supported with award funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S., its territories, or its possessions.</p>
        <p>Proposals outside of the scope of the above topics will be returned without review.</p>
        <p>Research proposals specific to detection of biological, chemical, and conventional weapons are excluded from the scope of this solicitation, however approaches that consider explosives detection and nuclear or radiological materials detection are of interest.</p>

<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><a name="review" id="review"></a><h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, will be reviewed. All proposals are carefully reviewed by DNDO-NSF staff, and by three to ten other persons outside NSF and DNDO who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by the DNDO-NSF Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer. In addition, DNDO-NSF Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities. </p>
        <p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives. </p>
        <p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        
        <h4>A. DNDO-NSF Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot; NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects. </p>
        <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i</a> prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol>
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>The following additional merit review considerations apply:
        <ul>
          <li>How responsive is the proposal to the topic areas and research objectives as described in Section II?</li>
          <li>How well does the proposal describe how the project will lead to progress in addressing a &quot;big problem&quot; in detection of nuclear threats that involves innovation and/or high risk?</li>
          <li>What potential does the project have for a major advance that is relevant to detection of shielded or unshielded nuclear weapons or special nuclear material (plutonium or highly enriched uranium)?</li>
          <li>How well does the proposal describe its multi-disciplinary and/or multi-institutional approach?</li>
          <li>What is the project's potential to attract broad scientific and public interest and support?</li>
          <li>How effective are the project's educational, dissemination, and, especially for large awards, management plans?</li>
          <li>What is the degree of undergraduate and/or graduate student participation in the effort?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4><a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, a panel consisting of a DNDO Executive and an NSF Executive will recommend whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. DNDO-NSF are striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the DNDO-NSF Executive Panel accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the DNDO-NSF Program Officers.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF or DNDO should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a DNDO-NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <h3> <a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4> <a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
        <p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the DNDO-NSF Program Managers administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
        <h4> <a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>
        <p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>
        <p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong> </p>
        <p>NSF will fund the initial year of the projects with funds made available from DHS in accordance with NSF policies and conditions. Future funding beyond year one will be awarded and administered by DHS, contingent upon awardees' progress and availability of funds, in accordance with DHS/DNDO policies and procedures.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>Although NSF will provide funding only for the initial year of each award, all annual and final project reports must be submitted through Research.gov. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. </p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>An annual grantees workshop will enable the investigators of grants awarded through this solicitation to review progress, exchange information, and promote collaborations. The PI, all co-PIs, and at least one of the students supported from each funded grant will be required to participate. Representatives of DNDO, DHS Science and Technology, other Federal agencies and various National Laboratories and industry are also expected to be present at this annual workshop to provide an expanded opportunity for collaboration and information sharing.  Funds must be included in each year of the proposal budget for attendance at this annual workshop. For budgetary purposes the workshop may be assumed to be in the Washington, D.C. area and be of three days duration. This workshop will be a primary mechanism for the DNDO-NSF program managers to assess progress and thus to adjust the future funding profiles for individual projects. (Include in budget request.)</p>

          <p><strong>ABOUT THE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR DETECTION OFFICE</strong></p>
          <p>Recognizing the risks associated with the potential use of a nuclear weapon within the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has integrated all nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support into a single office: the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). DNDO will develop a global nuclear detection architecture; conduct research and development; and acquire and support the deployment of domestic nuclear detection systems.</p>
          <p>DNDO is a jointly staffed office established to improve the Nation&rsquo;s capability to detect and report unauthorized attempts to import, possess, store, develop, or transport nuclear or radiological material for use against the Nation, and to further enhance this capability over time.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
