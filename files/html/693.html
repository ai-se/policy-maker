            <p><strong>The Directorate for Computer and Information  Science and Engineering (CISE) of the National Science Foundation recently  released a revised solicitation for the CISE</strong><strong><em> Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) </em><strong>Program.  The CRI solicitation (NSF 08-570) can be found at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08570">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08570</a></strong></strong></p>

</ul>
<p><a name="Q_1" id="Q_1"></a></p>
<p><strong>Why have the scope  and funding levels of the CRI program been changed?</strong></p>
<p>The  CRI solicitation was revised to accomplish the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that CISE researchers  have adequate  infrastructures to carry out their research goals.</li>
<li>Provide a logical, phased-pathway  for the development or procurement of deployable, community-serving  infrastructures that support CISE research.</li>
<li>Ensure that CISE-funded infrastructures  contribute to building  research capacity and provide acceptable <strong>quality </strong>of service to users of those systems.</li>
<li>Improve the long-term sustainability and  availability of existing, worthwhile CISE-related infrastructures  (whether originally funded by NSF or by other sources).</li>
<li>Leverage existing  infrastructure investments by: Extending and expanding the infrastructures  to support new research directions; Making infrastructures available to a broader user  community.</li>
<li>Broaden the population of users  who can benefit from past investments in infrastructure, making them regionally  available to  colleges and pre-colleges for educational purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRI program is committed to maintaining  a broad portfolio of projects that support research and education across a  diverse population and lessens the digital divide. The program encourages  proposals from minority and minority-serving institutions or from teams that  include such institutions.</p>
<p><a name="Q_2" id="Q_2"></a></p>
<p><strong>Four institutions in  my geographical area are willing to cooperate to build a shared lab for  robotics research. Should we apply for an Institutional Infrastructure grant or  a Community Infrastructure grant?</strong></p>
<p>If your intent is to  create a dedicated infrastructure, share it informally, and possibly  collaborate on your research efforts, then your project more closely fits the  scope of the CRI Institutional Infrastructure (II) type of project. If,  however, your view of your facility more closely resembles a &ldquo;utility&rdquo; where  users are provided with support, functionality and services are stable, and  access is open, then you may want to pursue a Community Infrastructure (CI)  grant. Community Infrastructure grants are meant for very broad research  communities, not just geographically co-located groups of institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q_3" id="Q_3"></a></p>
<p><strong>My institution owns  equipment that was created using university funds. Can we apply for CRI funding  to enhance that infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, infrastructures need not have been funded by NSF to be eligible  for CRI funding. The CRI Program will fund enhancements that extend or enhance  the research capabilities or useful life of your infrastructure. You can also  request funding to support the expansion of your facilities to serve a broader  group of researchers inside or external to your institution. So, for example,  you might virtualize access to your infrastructure so that it can be used  remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q_4" id="Q_4"></a></p>
<p><strong>We have a collection  of equipment that successfully supported our research in the past. Now that it  has served its useful life in that context, can we apply for funding to make it  usable for student projects and courses? Can we request funding to transform it  into a resource that can be used by a broader educational community? In that  case, what will CRI fund?</strong></p>
<p>The CRI program will  support educationally-focused infrastructure efforts. Those efforts could be  designed to engage students who participate in research projects. &nbsp;CRI will also support projects that enhance an  infrastructure so that it better serves strictly educational purposes. For  example, you might transform your existing research platform so that it  supports course work, provides a unique research experience for undergraduate  educational purposes at your institution or at institutions in your  geographical area. CRI is especially interested in supporting projects that make  research infrastructure available to pre-K, K-12 institutions, community  colleges, minority-serving institutions and predominantly undergraduate  institutions.</p>
<p>For allowable funding  requests, refer to the appropriate section of the CRI Program announcement that  applies to the activity you plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q_5" id="Q_5"></a></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Our research infrastructure  requirements are quite modest in the context of the CRI funding limits. Will  CRI fund research equipment or data purchases in the $50K region?</strong></span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As described in the CRI Program announcement: II proposals  may request up to $1.5M total for project durations not to exceed 3 years;&nbsp;CI  Planning (CI-P) planning proposals may request up to $100,000 for a duration of  up to one year; CI Acquisition, Development, Deployment and/or Operations (CI-ADDO)  proposals may request up to $4 million for durations of up to 4 years and up to  $250,000 per year for operating the infrastructure.</p>
<p>There is no minimum request in the CRI program. It is expected that only a small number of II awards will  be made in the $750,000-$1,500,000 range. The majority of II grants will be  made in the $200,000 - $750,000 range. &nbsp;However,  projects that request less than $200,000 for equipment, data-repository  development and/or access, or other research-supporting infrastructures are  welcomed from single institutions or consortia of institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_6" id="Q_6"></a>Will CRI fund  infrastructure to support undergraduate student research?</strong></p>
<p>The CRI program focuses on supporting faculty research. However,  faculty are strongly encouraged to provide research experiences for  undergraduates, via the proposed infrastructure. But, the CRI program will provide  undergraduate student stipend support ONLY when the undergraduate students are  participating in the design, acquisition, development or operation (if a  CI-ADDO proposal) of the research infrastructure.&nbsp; Requests for support of undergraduate student  stipends that support students&rsquo; research projects should be submitted to other  NSF programs like the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a name="Q_7" id="Q_7"></a>Can undergraduate  institutions submit CRI proposals?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, predominantly undergraduate institutions are strongly encouraged  to submit CRI proposals. Universities,  two- and four-year colleges (including community colleges) located and  accredited in the USA  may submit proposals to CRI provided the proposed infrastructure supports a  well-defined research activity at those and collaborating institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_8" id="Q_8"></a>Will a CRI grant  support the costs of convening workshops? </strong></p>
<p>CRI will support workshops under certain circumstances, and when well  justified in the proposals. There are several purposes and mechanisms within  CRI for funding workshops. The program supports Planning proposals for those  who wish to develop Community Infrastructure (CI). For proposals in this  category, workshops are strongly encouraged in order to build support for and  consensus among potential users of the CI about the support and services that  the future CI will provide. . For II projects, particularly those that involve  the transformation of an existing infrastructure for broader use by researchers  and/or educators, proposers may convene workshops that build community among  those users. As another example, CI-ADDO projects may use community workshops  as a means by which to enhance or assess user support.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_9" id="Q_9"></a>NSF policy no longer  invites external letters of support. How should we document user support for  our Community Infrastructure proposal?</strong></p>
<p>A CI proposal (whether to  create a new infrastructure or enhance or maintain an existing infrastructure)  is required to include materials that document the user community&rsquo;s consensus  about functional requirements of the infrastructure and the quality of services  and support provided to its users. In your proposal&rsquo;s Supplemental Materials,  you should describe the research community you will be or are supporting,  including a list of institutions and individuals, provide evidence of the  community&rsquo;s consensus with respect to the particular characteristics of the  proposed infrastructure, and describe how you obtained your documentation of  support from the community. If you had a planning grant, a summary of this  grant&rsquo;s results should be included as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_10" id="Q_10"></a>We plan to submit an Institutional Infrastructure proposal  for a facility that will serve our own university.&nbsp; Can CRI funds be used to support Broadening  Participation activities outside our university? </strong></p>
<p>All NSF proposals must involve Broader Impacts. Those impacts may  influence change in any of a variety of arenas.</p>
<p>One critical Broader Impact for the nation results from projects that  pay attention to Broadening Participation.&nbsp;  Broadening Participation (BP) activities address the roles that  infrastructure can play in expanding the participation of under-represented  groups in computing. CISE investments in research and education rely on a  diverse, competitive, engaged, pool of participants. CRI BP activities focus on  improving the resources available to under-represented groups to enhance  opportunities and benefit the future success of research in CISE. BP, in the  context of CISE-infrastructure, supports activities focused on: inclusivity --  supporting access to research infrastructure for members of under-represented  groups and institutions that serve under-represented cohorts; diversity --  supporting the participation of under-represented groups in research and  education in computing; and excellence -- supporting the engagement of  under-represented investigators in cutting-edge research projects to enhance  the human capital in CISE-related exploration.</p>
<p>CISE strongly encourages  all individual and team-proposers to seek the full participation of women,  minorities, and persons with disabilities in research and education activities.  &nbsp;Consequently, women, minorities, persons  with disabilities, and minority or minority-serving institutions, are strongly  encouraged to submit proposals. In addition, the CRI program seeks research and  education related proposals that take extraordinary steps to initiate, expand  and retain the pool of&nbsp;minority computer scientists engaged in research,  to expand the population of role models at minority or minority serving  institutions, or that propose innovative activities designed to attract members  of under-represented groups that engage in infrastructure-related computing research.  So for example, if you propose to work with a local community college whose  faculty and students will have access to your II for research and education  purposes, CRI funds could be used to engage your collaborators in the design,  development, acquisition and/or deployment of the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_11" id="Q_11"></a>Does hiring an  undergraduate or graduate student during the summer satisfy the &ldquo;Integration of  Research and Education&rdquo; merit review criteria?</strong></p>
<p> No. The role of  undergraduate students directly supported by a CRI award is limited to their  involvement in the development of the infrastructure, not for their  participation in research. The integration of research and education may be  accomplished through other means such as the development of curricula related to  the research efforts supported by the CRI award.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong><a name="Q_12" id="Q_12"></a>How should we document the &ldquo;national need&rdquo; requirement for  a Community Infrastructure project? </strong></p>
<p>Because CI projects  are more comprehensive and targeted for use by a broad community, CI proposals  must document that a community exists, that the community agrees that there is  need for the proposed infrastructure, as well as specifying the scope, quality,  and conditions of its use, and the existence of such a community engaged in the  research supported by the CI is important to the nation.</p>
<p> Evidence should be provided  from a variety of sources that justifies the investment of CRI funding in a CI  project on the basis of a national need. The need may be based on global  competitiveness, national safety and security, or other rationales.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_13" id="Q_13"></a>Will CRI fund an operation and maintenance project where  operation and maintenance functions and costs are outsourced with a  sub-contract?</strong></p>
<p> If it is proposed that any  aspects of the operation and maintenance of a CI infrastructure is to be  contracted out of the host institution, that out-sourcing must be carefully  documented and justified in the proposal and its budget. &nbsp;The out-sourcing of intellectual aspects (e.g.  user support, configuration management, etc.) of a CI project is discouraged.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a name="Q_14" id="Q_14"></a>Will either II or CI grants fund &ldquo;expert consultants?&rdquo;  What about professional programmers who are not students?</strong></p>
<p> Support for &ldquo;Expert  Consultants&rdquo; may be requested since some projects may require expertise of  personnel other than the PI and Co-PIs. When such personnel are included in the  proposal their role is limited to activities directly related to the  development of the infrastructure. &nbsp;Of  course, such requests must be well justified in the proposal. In particular,  the CRU program will support professional programmers for software development  activities when the requests are well justified. </p>
<p>Projects may also include funding for undergraduate and graduate  students, and Post-Docs, providing those participants&rsquo; responsibilities that  are funded through the CRI project do not involve research. Also, it is  important that their role in supporting the CRI infrastructure does not  interfere with their engagement in research outside the context of the CRI  project.&nbsp; The inclusion of staff engaged  in activities other than infrastructure development and/or operation and  maintenance is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a name="Q_15" id="Q_15"></a>The project supported by the infrastructure we are  proposing will involve some field work (where sensors are installed in remote  locations). Will CRI funding support the cost of the field work?</strong></p>
<p>Any justified activities for the development  and/or maintenance of an infrastructure are supported, including the costs  associated with necessary field-work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_16" id="Q_16"></a>We have the opportunity of collaborating with researchers  from industry. Will CRI support the travel costs for both sets of participants?  What about international collaborations?</strong></p>
<p>Salary or travel for industrial collaborators is not supported by CRI.  Support for international travel by the project&rsquo;s PI and/or Co-PIs can be  provided through CRI. </p>
<p>There are several options for  obtaining additional funding for international collaboration. NSF&rsquo;s Office of  International Science and Engineering (OISE) will support planning visits and workshops/seminars,  programs for students and post-docs, dissertation enhancement, Summer  Institutes/Advanced Studies Institutes, International Postdoctoral Fellowships,  and Partnerships for International Research and Education. OISE will also  co-fund collaborative international research and education activities within  NSF programs, such as CRI, through new proposals and supplements to active NSF  grants.</p>
<p>With  very few exceptions, NSF will not directly support your international  collaborators. Proposers should refer to NSF&rsquo;s  Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide guidance on international  collaboration: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf08_1/index.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf08_1/index.jsp</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_17" id="Q_17"></a>For a project that involves building or annotating data  that serves as a research infrastructure, what kinds of costs will be funded?</strong></p>
<p>All the costs of  developing such an infrastructure, which are clearly justified and documented  in the budget, are covered by CRI. This may include, for example, the cost of  annotations or other activities associated with structuring, storing, and using  such a repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_18" id="Q_18"></a>Does the CRI program address minority serving institutions  or minority researchers the way CISE&rsquo;s Minority Institutional Infrastructure (MII)  program did?</strong></p>
<p>The CRI program is  committed to maintaining a broad portfolio of projects that support research  and education across a diverse population and lessens the digital divide. The  program strongly encourages proposals from minority and&nbsp;minority-serving  institutions or from teams that include such institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_19" id="Q_19"></a>Can we request an enhancement grant for an infrastructure  that does not consist of equipment?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can request  an enhancement grant for such an infrastructure; however, as in the case of  equipment you&rsquo;d need to describe the new research which would be made possible  by the proposed enhancement.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_20" id="Q_20"></a>Will CI operations and maintenance funding cover our costs  for delivering services such as communications, supplies, documentation (e.g.  building our website) and other incidental costs?</strong></p>
<p>Expenses that are directly  attributable to and justified for the maintenance of the infrastructure will be  funded. So, for example, proposals may not include expenses for the institution&rsquo;s  &ldquo;general computer services&rdquo; unless those costs are in some way connected to the  operation of the CI facility. Likewise, only those incidental expenses directly  related to the support of users may be requested. For example, the design and maintenance  of a website that provides specific information that users require to engage in  their research using the infrastructure may be supported, when well justified.  However, the maintenance of a web site that simply disseminates general  information about the infrastructure would not be supported. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_21" id="Q_21"></a>Why doesn&rsquo;t the CRI Program fund our graduate students and  post-docs to engage in their research? Will CRI cover the costs of hiring  full-time researchers who do not have tenure faculty appointments?</strong></p>
<p> CISE  provides many research programs that support graduate students and post-docs to  engage in research (a comprehensive list of DISCOVERY programs is provided at  the end of the solicitation).&nbsp; The CRI  program provides funding for planning, development, and/or procurement,  deployment, enhancement, extension, sustainability and use of research  infrastructure to <strong>support</strong> research  in CISE disciplines. The CRI does NOT fund research activities per se.  Consequently, the CRI program supports (including students and individuals who  do not have tenure faculty appointments) ONLY to engage in the development or  maintenance of infrastructure. The role of students and other personnel should  be carefully documented in the proposal and its budget justification. Requests  for support of research activities should be made through CISE&rsquo;s core research  programs.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_22" id="Q_22"></a>Our project involves cross-disciplinary activities with  researchers from our institution&rsquo;s Biology department as well as the local  medical college. Will CRI cover any of their efforts?</strong></p>
<p> CRI will fund activities  that are directly related to the development or maintenance of an  infrastructure. The program does not fund the research activities that the  infrastructure supports. So, if aspects of your collaborators&rsquo; involvement contribute  directly to the infrastructure, support can be requested in keeping with the  guidelines in the CRI Program announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_23" id="Q_23"></a>If we submit an operations and maintenance or enhancement  proposals for our existing infrastructure, how should we document the quality  of service we provided to users?</strong></p>
<p>It is important for you to prepare  comprehensive evidence of your past performance in supporting research with  your infrastructure. You should not submit user letters as &ldquo;testimonials&rdquo;.  Prepare a data-rich summary that captures the quality of the service your  infrastructure has provided including, as a minimum: the identity of and  contact information for users, the kinds of research that is being carried out  using your infrastructure, a list of the specific projects that used the  infrastructure, statistics about response time and other quality of service  measures, a description of user-support mechanisms, URL(s) for your website and  websites developed by users of your infrastructure, lists of publications that  cite your resource, and any other data that captures the value of your resource  to the broader research community. This material should be tabulated and  summarized.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q_24" id="Q_24"></a>Will CRI fund the activities needed to make our community  infrastructure available to new populations of users through virtual-access?</strong></p>
<p> Yes -- CRI is particularly  interested in creative new ways to leverage research infrastructure so they can  serve a broader community.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a name="Q_25" id="Q_25"></a>Is it allowable to propose to develop an REU-Site around a  CRI-funded infrastructure?</strong></p>
Yes &ndash; providing that the REU-site  participants are directly involved in research activities related to the  infrastructure and that they do not interfere with its use by the originally  targeted researchers that the infrastructure was meant to serve. The  integration of research and education and the mentoring of future researchers  is strongly encouraged and supported by CISE.
