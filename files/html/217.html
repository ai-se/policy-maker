        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have awarded a large share of bachelor's degrees to African American students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and nine of the top ten baccalaureate institutions of African American STEM doctorate recipients from 2008-2012 are HBCUs.<sup>[<a href="#one">1</a>]  </sup>In 2012, 8.5% of black undergraduates attended HBCUs,<sup>[<a href="#two">2</a>]</sup> and HBCUs awarded 16.7% of the bachelor's degrees and 17.8% of the S&amp;E bachelor's degrees to black students that year.<sup>[<a href="#one">1</a>]</sup> To meet the nation's accelerating demands for STEM talent, more rapid gains in achievement and successful degree completion in STEM for underrepresented minority populations are needed. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at HBCUs as a means to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. To this end, HBCU-UP provides awards to develop, implement, and study evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Support is available for Targeted Infusion Projects, Broadening Participation Research Projects, Research Initiation Awards, Implementation Projects, Achieving Competitive Excellence Implementation Projects, and Broadening Participation Research Centers; as well as other funding opportunities.</p>
            <p>Targeted Infusion Projects (TIP) provide support to achieve a short-term, well-defined goal for improving the quality of undergraduate STEM education at HBCUs. The Broadening Participation Research (BPR) in STEM Education track provides support for research projects that seek to create and study new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented groups in STEM undergraduate education.  Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for STEM faculty at HBCUs to pursue new research at the home institution, a NSF-funded research center, a research intensive institution or a national laboratory. Implementation Projects provide support to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts for increasing the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in STEM and enhancing the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. Within this track, Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) Implementation Projects are intended for HBCUs with exemplary achievements and established institutionalized foundations from previous Implementation Project grants. Broadening Participation Research Centers provide support to conduct world-class research at institutions that have held three rounds of Implementation or ACE Implementation Projects and with demonstrated capability to conduct broadening participation research.</p>
            <p>Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to represent the collective intelligence of HBCU STEM higher education, and serve as the national hubs for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. Centers are expected to conduct research on STEM education and broadening participation in STEM; perform outreach to HBCUs in order to build capacity for conducting this type of research; and work to transfer and disseminate promising broadening participation research in order to enhance STEM education and research outcomes for African American undergraduates across the country.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is a program in the Division of Human Resource Development in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. HBCU-UP is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as a means to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. HBCU-UP realizes this purpose by providing awards to develop, implement, and study innovative models and approaches for making dramatic improvements in the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may participate successfully in graduate programs and/or careers in STEM disciplines.</p>
          <p>HBCU-UP has identified the following priority areas: innovation in instruction and curriculum development; access to STEM research experiences for undergraduate students; recruitment and retention, especially retention in STEM fields during and after the freshman year; critical transitions from K-12 to undergraduate, 2-year to 4-year, and undergraduate to graduate school; increased research capacity of STEM faculty; evidence-based leadership and professional development of faculty; and STEM teacher preparation.</p>
          <p>HBCU-UP is particularly interested in building knowledge in areas related to the following questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the underlying issues affecting the participation and success of African American students in STEM undergraduate education?</li>
            <li>What replicable models of successful STEM programs at HBCUs can be developed, described, and adopted by other HBCUs and other institutions that serve underrepresented minority students?</li>
            <li>What are effective methods of increasing the capacity of HBCUs to produce more STEM graduates who are highly qualified for the STEM workforce or graduate school?</li>
            <li>What models of collaborations and partnerships that include HBCUs have the greatest short- and long-term positive impact for the HBCU institution, faculty, and/or students?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to National Science Foundation data <sup>[<a href="#three">3</a>]</sup>, black students comprise 2% of the B.S. degree recipients in the geosciences, 2.6% in physics and 3.9% in engineering, while Blacks comprise 14.9% of the college-aged population (assuming an 18-24 year population). There is a role for HBCUs to play in increasing their nation-wide prevalence in these particular fields. Therefore, HBCU-UP encourages the submission of innovative projects that offer solutions to the severe underrepresentation of African American students in engineering, the geosciences and physics at the undergraduate level.</p>
          <p>The McKinsey Report <sup>[<a href="#four">4</a>]</sup> estimates that the United States faces a shortage of almost 200,000 people with &ldquo;deep analytical skills&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;1.5 million managers and analysts to analyze big data and make decisions based on their findings&rdquo;. HBCU-UP encourages the submission of proposals that support efforts to educate the next generation of undergraduate students to confront the challenges in computational and data-enabled science.</p>
          <p>HBCU-UP's priorities and efforts to accelerate the quality and effectiveness of the education of undergraduate students at HBCUs are in alignment with findings and recommendations in a number of reports and documents <sup>[<a href="#five">5</a>], [<a href="#six">6</a>], [<a href="#seven">7</a>], [<a href="#eight">8</a>], [<a href="#nine">9</a>]</sup>. These reports outline the importance of the undergraduate experience for preparing a diverse and highly skilled STEM workforce, and a STEM-literate public ready to support and benefit from the progress of science, as well as the importance of preparing STEM teachers for the K-12 level. The call for Broadening Participation Research Centers and research in broadening participation aligns with the recommendation in the report <sup>[<a href="#ten">10</a>]</sup> from the Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering to "better address emerging challenges and opportunities and the limited progress being made in improving broadening participation in STEM".</p>

        <h3> <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have awarded a large share of bachelor's degrees to African American students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and HBCUs are the baccalaureate origins of one-quarter to one-third of black science and engineering (S&amp;E) doctorate recipients <sup>[1].</sup> To meet the nation's accelerating demands for STEM talent, more rapid gains in STEM for underrepresented minority populations are needed. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides awards to develop, implement, and study innovative models and approaches for making dramatic improvements in the preparation and success of underrepresented minority students to participate in the S&amp;E enterprise. Support is available for Targeted Infusion Projects, Broadening Participation Research Projects, Research Initiation Awards, Implementation Projects/Achieving Competitive Excellence Implementation Projects, Broadening Participation Research Centers, and other funding opportunities.</p>
 
          <p><strong>1. TARGETED INFUSION PROJECTS:</strong> Projects of two to three years targeted for short-term, well-defined goals to improve the quality of and make innovations in undergraduate STEM education at HBCUs.</p>
          <p>Targeted Infusion Projects are expected to build knowledge with respect to STEM education. Projects must describe and make a strong case for how a project advances the knowledge base in STEM education through research, evaluation or a combination of research and evaluation processes. The theoretical and empirical justification for the proposed project must be clearly articulated.</p>
          <p>Targeted Infusion Projects could create or adapt innovative learning experiences and pedagogies in STEM fields. Projects could develop creative uses of cyberlearning. Projects could enhance academic infrastructure by updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, or improving the computational network array supporting research and education. Projects could enhance existing degree programs, establish new degree programs or concentrations, secure specialized accreditation or certification, or infuse STEM programs with disciplinary field advances and evolving workforce requirements. Projects that develop faculty expertise, promote implementation of educational innovations, or focus on the preparation of future K-12 teachers are encouraged. Projects should be guided by research on teaching and learning.</p>
          <p>Competitive proposals will describe clearly the innovation in undergraduate STEM education the project will realize. Appropriate short-term goals should be easily measurable and attainable within the project time frame, and appropriate metrics should be identified. The proposal also should include activities for dissemination of project results.</p>
          <p>HBCUs that currently have a five-year Implementation Project will need to explain how  the Targeted Infusion Project differs from the Implementation Project activities and how  the HBCU-UP funded projects will be leveraged, integrated, or synergized to produce greater outcomes that could not be achieved separately.</p>
          <p><strong>2. BROADENING PARTICIPATION RESEARCH IN STEM EDUCATION PROJECTS</strong>: Projects of up to three years to investigate topics that impact the recruitment, retention, and success of African Americans in STEM education and the workforce.</p>
          <p>Broadening Participation Research proposals in STEM Education may investigate behavioral, cognitive, affective, learning and social differences as well as organizational, institutional or systemic processes that may impact participation and success in STEM education. Successful proposals will be grounded in appropriate theory and incorporate recent innovations and advances in research methodologies, conceptual frameworks, and/or data gathering and analytic techniques. Proposals should reflect relevant advances in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research and evaluation methodologies and provide a compelling argument about how the methodologies proposed are appropriately matched with the strategic research questions of the project. Additionally, proposals should demonstrate how the methods chosen will result in rigorous, cumulative, reproducible, and usable findings to merit peer-review and publication.</p>
          <p>Broadening Participation Research proposals must include PIs with demonstrable expertise in education research and/or social science research methods and knowledge about STEM programs at HBCUs.  Proposers are encouraged to establish collaborations to strengthen the research project and describe in the proposal the nature of the collaboration and the anticipated benefits.  As appropriate, proposals should describe mechanisms to effectively and efficiently transfer findings into educational practice for use by other researchers and policymakers.</p>
          <p><strong>3.  RESEARCH INITIATION AWARDS: </strong>Projects of up to three years to perform scientific research.</p>
          <p>Research Initiation Awards provide support for a STEM faculty member at the HBCU to pursue research at either the home institution, an NSF-funded Center, a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The project description should contain all of the elements of a standard NSF research proposal. The project should further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness,  improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Research Initiation Awards are for faculty who are starting to build a research program. Faculty members who hold or have held an external research award within the last three years are not eligible for the Research Initiation Award.</p>
          <p><strong>4A. IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS:</strong> Projects up to five years to advance institution-wide, undergraduate STEM education and research.</p>
          <p>Implementation Projects provide support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students pursuing STEM degrees and the quality of their preparation. Implementation projects should create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate experience. Proposers are encouraged to analyze the strengths and potential of the institution in STEM. Based on this analysis they should design and/or adapt innovative educational strategies that are appropriate in content and context for increasing the capacity and effectiveness of the institution to attract, retain, educate, and train students from groups underrepresented in STEM and prepare them to succeed in graduate school or the workforce.  Transferability and dissemination of successful models, effective methods, and innovative materials for educating undergraduate STEM students are critical aspects of implementation projects.</p>
          <p>Innovative models and tools for STEM teaching and learning developed through an Implementation Project should be part of comprehensive institutional reform and transformational strategies to strengthen and enhance STEM teaching and learning, and improve student access and retention in STEM areas. The components of the implementation design should comprise research-based or evidence-based practices and strategies to produce significant improvements in undergraduate STEM education and research programs at the institution.  Project components may include, but are not limited to: Developing and assessing innovative STEM curriculum teaching and learning techniques; using cyberinfrastructure for anytime, anywhere, anyone learning; providing novel undergraduate student development activities and educational enrichment services; enhancing undergraduate student research experiences; providing activities that promote the development of a globally engaged workforce, including international research experiences for undergraduate students and faculty; creating new approaches to recruitment and retention of undergraduate STEM students; providing faculty professional development in effective STEM teaching, pedagogy, and research; preparing K-12 STEM teachers; addressing the critical transitions from K-12 to undergraduate, 2-year to 4-year, and undergraduate to graduate; and implementing other activities that enhance the quality and competitiveness of undergraduate STEM programs. Implementation Projects should establish sustainable practices and mechanisms that prepare students to compete successfully for graduate research fellowships. Efforts should be made to increase the number of students submitting competitive applications to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, as well as other competitive fellowship programs. The recruitment and retention of veterans in STEM fields as a means to diversify and increase the STEM workforce is encouraged.</p>
          <p>NSF expects that the activities and strategies included in Implementation Project proposals will be consistent with and complementary to the institution's STEM needs, long-term goals, and mission. NSF, therefore, allows maximum flexibility in the design of Implementation Projects under HBCU-UP. The proposal, however, must fully substantiate the rationale for choosing the desired approach.  The project scope should depend on the size and number of STEM departments or programs at the institution and be defined by the complexity of the proposed activities in the project design. Ideally, the implementation project would impact all the STEM undergraduate programs, STEM students, and STEM faculty at the institution. The project plan should be clearly described, detailing measurable outcomes for STEM students (e.g. number and types of high quality research experiences, number going on to graduate school or the workforce) and faculty of the proposed HBCU-UP activities.  The proposal should include compelling arguments for why the practices and strategies implemented in the specific institutional environment are expected to result in the anticipated outcomes. The proposal also should include activities for scholarly dissemination of project results and processes to inform the broader community about the effectiveness of specific implementation strategies.</p>
          <p>If an institution has previously received an Implementation Project grant, it is critical that the proposal for another Implementation Project provide complete information on the outcomes and impact of the previous HBCU-UP project, including a description of what was learned from the previous activities, how these findings were disseminated to the broader community, and how successful activities are being sustained at the institution. Implementation proposals from past awardees must not simply propose to continue the activities of the previous Implementation Project grant. The new proposal should be based on a thorough evaluation of the previous HBCU-UP project and an assessment of the current state of the institution so that a new project can build on progress and achievements and identify new innovations undertaken in order to move the institution into the next level of STEM program competitiveness. The proposal should include a component that outlines a strategy for the creative integration of NSF-funded awards at the institution that are related to the proposed project's goals and scope.</p>
          <p>Proposals for a second round or subsequent Implementation Project must include a research project that is linked to the proposed interventions and strategies to formally study such strategies in the particular setting of the HBCU. Projects may offer a postdoctoral research fellowship to a social science or educational researcher to provide opportunities early in his or her career and to work with this research project.</p>
          <p><strong>4B. ACE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS:</strong> Five-year, institution-wide, sustainable and potentially transformative projects that advance STEM education and research.</p>
          <p>Institutions that have had previous Implementation Project grants should be able to exhibit an established foundation and to provide evidence of institutionalized achievements toward the HBCU-UP goals and objectives. As a result, growth in competitiveness of these HBCU-UP institutions should be reflected in the readiness of faculty and institution leadership to move to the next level of excellence. The Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) Implementation Project track is intended for HBCUs exhibiting these qualities as a result of previous Implementation Project grants.  The goal of the ACE program is to help institutions to bolster their capacity and move onto the national landscape in undergraduate STEM education and research. ACE projects are ambitious, potentially transformative proposals that have the promise of significant advances in STEM undergraduate education at the institution. ACE projects should create more and varied pathways to success for STEM students by increasing intellectual and evidence-based resources. Possible approaches might include: establishing new collaborations and alliances with public and private research institutions, centers, and national laboratories; providing access to tomorrow's science through computationally intensive tools and global networks; establishing international collaborations to enhance undergraduate student and faculty research; or increasing fiscal resources for frontier STEM education and research through innovative institutional integration, leveraging partnerships, and strong linkages with business and industry.  Institutions submitting an ACE Implementation Project must include a component that outlines a strategy for the creative integration of NSF-funded awards at the institution that are related to the proposed project's goals and scope, and that describes how the institution thinks strategically about moving forward in STEM education and research.</p>
          <p>ACE Implementation Projects must include a research project that is linked to the proposed approaches and interventions to formally study such approaches in the particular setting of the HBCU. Projects may offer a postdoctoral research fellowship to a social science or educational researcher to provide opportunities early in his or her career and to work with this research project.</p>
          <p><strong>5. BROADENING PARTICIPATION RESEARCH CENTERS:</strong> Five-year projects that build the intellectual infrastructure to facilitate the creation, integration, and transfer of new knowledge in broadening participation research.</p>
          <p>Institutions that have been awarded three previous Implementation or ACE Implementation Projects are eligible to be the lead institution to submit a proposal for a Broadening Participation Research Center (BPRC). BPRCs conduct world-class research through partnerships as appropriate. BPRCs are expected to establish a culture in broadening participation research that will produce work adding to the research knowledge base and enhancing the understanding of the barriers that hinder and factors that enhance our ability to broaden participation in STEM. The results of these efforts will inform approaches to increase the access and involvement of underrepresented groups in STEM and to strengthen our national STEM capabilities and competitive advantage. NSF expects BPRCs to demonstrate leadership in the involvement of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM at all levels - students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty.</p>
          <p>Centers will offer the HBCU community a venue for interaction and an effective mechanism to undertake long-term integrated research and education activities in the science of broadening participation; and to develop approaches to ensure the transfer of knowledge of research and education advances. BPRC partner institutions work together with the lead institution as an integrated whole to achieve the shared research, education, outreach, and knowledge-transfer goals of the Center.</p>
          <p>The National Academies Report <sup>[<a href="#eleven">11</a>]</sup> states that &ldquo;HBCUs by their very mission, purpose and environment are more likely to achieve success&rdquo;  in recruiting, retaining, and graduating African American students in STEM fields and lists the reasons for this success. Therefore, Centers are expected to gather and represent the collective intelligence of HBCU STEM higher education, and serve as the national hub for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. Centers that meaningfully incorporate and promote broad and systemic connections to mainstream STEM higher education reform efforts are especially encouraged. These connections are critical, because according to the above cited report <sup>[<a href="#twelve">12</a>],</sup> &ldquo;only a small number of institutions (including HBCUs) serve the needs of underrepresented minority students&rdquo;.</p>
          <p><strong>6.  OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
          <p>HBCU-UP also funds conferences; EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) and grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID); and grant supplements for existing awards. Such proposals may be submitted, as described in the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG), which is available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">https://www.nsf.gov</a>.</p>

        <p>Review the regulations regarding Human Subjects (45 CFR 690.101-124 <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp</a>). This is particularly important for Broadening Participation Research Projects and Broadening Participation Research Centers.  Please note that Human Subjects regulations also govern activities that have to do with safeguarding individually identifiable information such as student and faculty surveys and data.  Therefore many Implementation Projects and possibly Targeted Infusion Projects may need to be reviewed by the Human Subjects Internal Review Board (IRB) for the institution. If the project will be IRB reviewed, please indicate on the cover sheet that the review is pending. If the proposal has already been IRB reviewed and found to be exempt, please indicate so on the cover sheet. If the IRB has already given approval of the activities include a letter from the IRB and indicate the expiration date of the IRB approval on the cover sheet. Please note that an award cannot be made unless the IRB process has been completed and documentation has been received by the program director prior to recommending the award.</p>
        <p><strong>REQUIRED COMPONENTS FOR ALL PROPOSALS</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>PROJECT SUMMARY - Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one page in length. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity. The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed. The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative to other persons working in the same or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal. <strong>Proposals that do not contain the Project Summary, including an overview and separate statements on intellectual merit and broader impacts will not be accepted by FastLane or will be returned without review.</strong></li>
          <li>PROJECT DESCRIPTION - 15 page limit.  The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled "Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work." This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Results from prior NSF support must be provided for PIs and co-PIs who have received NSF support within the last five years, Results related to Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts are described under two separate, distinct headlines. Refer to the "Project Description" section below for more information on each type of HBCU-UP proposal: 1) Targeted Infusion Projects, 2) Broadening Participation Research Projects, 3) Research Initiation Awards and 4) Implementation Projects and ACE Implementation Projects. Please note that the Project Description for Broadening Participation Research Center proposals has a 25 page limit. Further detail is provided in section 5) below.</li>
          <li>REFERENCES CITED - Provide the references cited in the proposal.</li>
          <li>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES - Outline the experiences of the PI and co-PIs (two-page limit each person) using the GPG guidelines.</li>
          <li>BUDGET - Follow the directions in the Grant Proposal Guide and refer to section B. Budgetary Information of this document.</li>
          <li>CURRENT AND PENDING SUPPORT- Use the formats provided in FastLane or Grants.gov. Enter this proposal as pending support.</li>
          <li>FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT &amp; OTHER RESOURCES - Provide a description of available facilities and priorities for their use, if applicable.  Please note that this section is a required part of the proposal. If not applicable, the proposer should enter "Not applicable" in the Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources section of the proposal.</li>
          <li>DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN - Must be included as a supplementary document and should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results. The plan should be commensurate with the scope and size of the proposal. Information can be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp</a> .</li>
          <li>POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER MENTORING PLAN - Must be included as a supplementary document if funding to support a postdoctoral researcher is requested.</li>
          <li>
            UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT MENTORING PLAN - HBCU-UP requires that each proposal that requests funding to support undergraduate students must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>PROJECT EVALUATION</strong></p>
        <p>Evaluation of the HBCU-UP projects is a high priority for this program.  All proposals, therefore, should include an evaluation section that describes how the project will be evaluated in determining the accomplishment of project goals and impact. The project evaluation should be designed to serve as a valuable source of information on how the project is being implemented, specifically, what works and what should be modified.  The evaluation plan should be based on benchmarks, indicators, or expected outcomes related to project goals and activities. Evaluation plans should include a Logic Model or other tool that connects the project goals to the specific activities, and outputs, as well as the outcomes.</p>
        <p>Evaluation plans should be appropriate to the size and scope of the project, and usually include both formative and summative components based on the evaluation questions of interest along with a proposed timeline. The purpose of a formative evaluation is to provide information for project improvement. The purpose of a summative evaluation is to assess the quality and impact of a fully implemented project. Formative evaluation plans outline methods for documenting progress toward project goals and should include a feedback feature that allows for continuous improvement of the project activities.  In some cases, formative evaluation may be internal to the project. A summative evaluation collects information about outcomes and related processes, strategies, and activities that have led to the demonstrated outcomes.</p>
        <p>The budget MUST include adequate resources for the project evaluation. Project evaluation should be led by an expert independent evaluator or evaluation team, depending on the size and scope of the project. Evaluators are expected to adhere to the American Evaluation Association&rsquo;s Guiding Principles for Evaluators (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=51">http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=51</a>), and project evaluations are expected to be consistent with standards established by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.jcsee.org/program-evaluation-standards-statements">http://www.jcsee.org/program-evaluation-standards-statements</a>).</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
        <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
   
        <p><strong>For HBCU-UP</strong>: In addition to the two NSF criteria for Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts, special review criteria for <strong>Implementation and ACE Implementation projects </strong>are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the proposal describe a convincing rationale and appropriate methods for the project activities that are research-based/evidence-based?</li>
          <li>Are the project design and methods linked to measureable outcomes and are they appropriate to the scope, scale, and setting for the project?</li>
          <li>Is the project likely to produce high quality results that contribute to the undergraduate STEM education knowledge base?</li>
          <li>Is the project likely to have an impact on STEM education, student learning, and faculty practice?</li>
          <li>Is the project management plan adequate and does it include clear roles and responsibilities of the personnel who will contribute to the project?</li>
          <li>Is there commitment of the leadership to the implementation process?</li>
          <li>Does the evaluation plan define indicators and benchmarks to inform the project team and others about the operations and effectiveness of the implementation?</li>
          <li>Does the project have a plan for effective and scholarly dissemination of results?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional review criteria for <strong>Broadening Participation Research Centers</strong> are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the proposal convey a vision for how the Center will establish a culture in broadening participation research that will produce work that adds to the research knowledge base?</li>
          <li>How are the research, education, outreach, and knowledge transfer efforts strategically embedded and integrated in the proposed Center?</li>
          <li>To what extent are the research, educational, outreach, and knowledge transfer activities innovative and how do they contribute to the unifying mission of the proposed Center?</li>
          <li>To what extent does the proposed Center management have the vision, experience, and capacity to manage a complex and innovative enterprise that integrates research, education, outreach, and knowledge transfer?</li>
          <li>Does the evaluation plan define indicators and benchmarks to inform the project team and others about the operations and effectiveness of the implementation?</li>
        </ul>
     

        <h4> <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
     <p>   Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Site Visit Review.
        </p>
        <p>The types of proposal review employed by HBCU-UP are panel and ad hoc; and for Broadening Participation Research Centers, site visits in addition to ad hoc and panel reviews. Separate review panels are assembled for Implementation Projects (including ACE), Broadening Participation Research Projects, Research Initiation Awards, and Targeted Infusion Projects and Broadening Participation Research Centers. Unsolicited proposals typically receive ad hoc reviews. Research Initiation Awards and Broadening Participation Research Centers receive a combination of ad hoc and panel reviews. For highly rated Broadening Participation Research Centers, site visits will be conducted before an award recommendation is made.</p>
        <p>Proposals for a Broadening Participation Research Center will be evaluated in a multi-phase merit review process. Preliminary proposals are required and will be evaluated by ad hoc review and a panel of experts in broadening participation research and education. Proposing institutions whose preliminary proposals are judged most promising by the panel and program directors will be invited to submit full proposals that will be evaluated by both ad hoc and panel review. Only those full proposals that were invited will be accepted. The full proposal review panel will identify those full proposals deemed worthy of site visit reviews; the other proposals will be declined. For proposals selected for a site visit, the site visit review will consider the review criteria, the vision and potential legacy of the proposed center, and institutional commitment to the proposed center.  Following the site visits, NSF staff will analyze reviews and discussion summaries.  The final decision concerning recommendations is based upon the proposal, the reviews and discussion summaries, and the site visit report. After the site visits, some centers selected for site visits may not be recommended for a center grant, but rather for a collaborative project award.</p>
       
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
        
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Reverse Site Visits: </em>Participation in a Reverse Site Visit (RSV) can be requested by NSF at any time during the grant period. The RSV is a presentation on the outcomes and progress of the grant activities at NSF in front of a peer review panel. Participation in the RSV is required by the appropriate grant management team and institutional administration.</p>
        <p><em>Site Visits:</em> NSF staff may visit the site of the grant project at anytime during the grant period. Reasonable accommodation of the site visit by NSF program staff is required by the grantee. NSF staff and/or a visiting committee will conduct site visits at Broadening Participation Research Centers annually.</p>
        <p align="left">Implementation Project, ACE Implementation Project, Targeted Infusion Project, Broadening Participation Research,  and Broadening Participation Research Center awardees are required to submit the annual evaluation of the project.</p>
        <p><em>Cooperation with NSF evaluation projects and special projects:</em> NSF, an NSF contractor, or a grantee on behalf of NSF, may from time to time conduct program evaluations or special projects of HBCU-UP projects. These may occur at anytime during the grant period and sometimes after the grant period has ended. Reasonable cooperation with these efforts is required by the grantee.</p>
        <h4> <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
