<H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3><div class="user_input">
  <p>The Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF)
    announces a program solicitation in support of HUD&rsquo;s Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing, or PATH. Whereas previous years&rsquo; solicitations have been open calls for a variety of research proposals, this year&rsquo;s
    solicitation focuses on groundbreaking proposals in the five interdisciplinary
    areas designated to be the forefront of housing technology through the NSF-PATH
    Housing Research Agenda Workshop held at the University of Central Florida
    in February of 2004, and sponsored by Michigan State University; Purdue University;
    University of Central Florida; and the National Consortium of Housing Research
    Centers in coordination with the NSF and PATH. These five interdisciplinary
    areas are: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Construction Management and Production</li>
    <li>Structural Design and Materials</li>
    <li>Building Enclosures, Energy, and Indoor Air Quality</li>
    <li>Community and Economic Impacts of Housing Technology</li>
    <li>Systems Interactions and Whole House Approaches</li>
</ol>
<p>Full descriptions of these areas as well as preliminary scholarship within them are available in the NSF-PATH Housing Research Agenda Workshop: Proceedings and Recommendations (Volumes I and II) published by PATH and available at <a href="http://www.pathnet.org/sp.asp?id=12201">http://www.pathnet.org/sp.asp?id=12201</a></p>
<p>Proposals should contribute to engineering and social science fields with a particular interest in interdisciplinary housing technology issues. Proposals must demonstrate advanced knowledge of housing research needs rather than applications or transfers of other techniques within the housing technology arena. Far reaching exploratory research that can lead to breakthrough technologies and engage transcendent technologies, or lead to groundbreaking technology-related social inquiry, is encouraged<strong>.</strong> Proposals should not include demonstrations or applications of technology unless included as part of the larger research proposal. Researchers are advised to visit the ENG website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/">https://www.nsf.gov/eng</a> for updates on this initiative, and to consult PATH for recent relevant scholarship<strong>.</strong></p>
<strong>Background.</strong> Despite the importance of the housing industry to the American economy, there is little investment in developing new residential technologies, or in understanding the reasons for this lack of investment (National Construction Goals, White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy, 1994). In addition, fragmentation among the various industry stakeholders &ndash; homebuilders, material manufacturers, university researchers and government officials &ndash; impedes communication and slows adoption of new housing technologies (NAHB Research Center, &quot;Building Better Homes at Lower Costs: The Industry Implementation Plan for the Residential National Construction Goals,&quot; 1996). As a result, true innovation and the introduction of emerging technologies into the housing marketplace rarely proceeds beyond the prototype stage, and understandings of broader motivational and behavioral practices are limited to product-specific surveys. For these reasons, PATH was created in 1998 and has continuously worked with NSF to create and update this program solicitation.
<p>The Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) is a cooperative initiative of the federal government and the homebuilding industry to streamline the development, dissemination and use of innovative housing technologies that improve America&rsquo;s homes. PATH works to speed the acceptance of innovative products and processes by understanding and eliminating the issues and institutional problems related to technology development in the housing industry, understanding the market, social, and industrial process for innovation, and developing new technologies themselves.</p>
<p>PATH recognizes that technological advances in fundamental research require continuous financial support, and acknowledges that fundamental research in housing technology requires an institutional setting<strong>.</strong> The National Science Foundation supports fundamental research that advances PATH&rsquo;s goals, and serves as the initiative&rsquo;s primary exploratory research component<strong>.</strong> As such, NSF has played a significant and far-reaching role within the PATH partnership.</p>
<p></p>

<a name="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3><div class="user_input">
  <p>There is an opportunity and need for long-term, organizational investments in fundamental research in housing innovation<strong>.</strong> This solicitation is designed to support fundamental engineering, industrial, and social science research that will help promote innovation adoption by the homebuilding industry<strong>.</strong> Proposals that address one or more of the five NSF-PATH Housing Research Agenda Workshop interdisciplinary areas are particularly invited<strong>.</strong> Proposed research projects should dramatically contribute to the advancement of the state of technology, engineering, or the social and economic studies of them, as well as have significant long-term impact for the homebuilding industry<strong>.</strong> Although the primary emphasis will be on achieving a high degree of fundamental understanding, any investigation of potential impact on new applications will also be accepted<strong>.</strong> Proposals that merely involve industrial development or applications of existing technologies that do not contribute to the body of knowledge, do not fall under this solicitation.
  </p>
  <p>It is anticipated that cooperation among researchers from different disciplines will open new avenues of research and develop new applications<strong>.</strong> Each research proposal should identify potential areas of application and potential impacts, and should address the ways in which education and training are integrated within the research program<strong>.</strong> Efforts that incorporate interdisciplinary education experience and that are conducive to student teamwork are also encouraged<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>

<a name="review"></a>
<h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3><a name="reviewcrit"></a>
<h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4><a name="reviewproc"></a>
<P>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</P><P>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsb9772">(NSB 97-72)</A>. All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </P><P>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?iin127">Important Notice 127</A>, Implementation of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding decisions.</P><P>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January 2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description. Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</P><P>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</P><P>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed below (see the <A href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant Proposal Guide</A> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</P><UL><B>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</B><BR>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</UL><UL><B>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</B><BR>How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</UL><P>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</P><UL><I><B>Integration of Research and Education</B></I><BR>One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</UL><UL><I><B>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</B></I><BR>Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</UL><UL><A name=rev_addl_crit_txt></A> <B>Additional Review Criteria</B>: How does the proposed activity suggest an innovative program for housing research? How does the proposed work help in achieving PATH goals? How does the proposed work help in expanding the body of knowledge of home building technology and the innovation process in general? How does it directly address one or more of the NSF-PATH Housing Research Agenda areas? What is the potential to foster and sustain innovation in housing in the long-term?<!--EndFragment-->

<h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4> <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal.  Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation will be reviewed by <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a>Ad Hoc and/or panel review. </p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p> In most cases, proposers will be contacted by the Program Officer after his or her recommendation to award or decline funding has been approved by the Division Director. This informal notification is not a guarantee of an eventual award. </p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation, or the date of proposal receipt, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3><a name="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>
  Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants 
  Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are 
  declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division 
  administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the 
  reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section 
  VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)
</p> <a name="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm">https://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpm">https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?gpm</a>. The GPM is also for sale through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20402. The telephone number at GPO for subscription information is (202) 512-1800.

<a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a>
<a name="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4><p>
  For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must 
  submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before 
  the end of the current budget period.  
</p><a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
 <p>
  Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final 
  project report.  Failure to provide final 
  technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the PI and all Co-PIs.  PIs 
  should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
  required data. 
</p>

<p>
PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. 
  This system permits electronic submission and updating of project reports, including 
  information on project participants (individual and organizational), activities and 
  findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions.   PIs will not be 
  required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in 
  earlier updates using the electronic system.

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering.  Awardees are wholly responsible for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for such findings or their interpretation.
</p>

<p>
NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and educators.  The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit eligibility.</p>

<p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
