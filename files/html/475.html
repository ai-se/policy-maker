          General Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>NSF and selected foreign counterpart science and technology agencies sponsor international research institutes for U.S. graduate students in seven East Asia and Pacific locations at times set by the counterpart agencies between June and August each year. The Summer Institutes (EAPSI) operate similarly and the research visits to a particular location take place at the same time. Although applicants apply individually to participate in a Summer Institute, awardees become part of the cohort for each location. Applicants must propose a location, host scientist, and research project that is appropriate for the host site and duration of the international visit. </p>
            <p>An EAPSI award provides U.S. graduate students in science, engineering, and education: 1) first-hand research experiences in Australia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, or Taiwan; 2) an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and 3) an orientation to the society, culture, and language. It is expected that EAPSI awards will help students initiate professional relationships to enable future collaboration with foreign counterparts. </p>
            <p>The NSF award includes participation in the Pre-Departure Orientation, summer stipend of $5,000, and roundtrip airplane ticket to the host location. EAPSI partner agencies pay in-country living expenses during the Summer Institutes. </p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Support of international activities is an integral part of the NSF mission to sustain and strengthen the nation's science, mathematics, and engineering capabilities, and to promote the use of those capabilities in service to society. In particular, NSF recognizes the importance of enabling U.S. researchers and educators to advance their work through international collaborations, and of helping ensure that future generations of U.S. scientists and engineers gain professional experience beyond this nation's borders early in their careers. </p>
    
       <a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>EAPSI awards are available in any area of science and engineering research or education supported by NSF.  Applicants are reminded that NSF does not support research in the biological sciences with public health or disease-related goals, including the etiology, diagnosis, or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality or malfunction in humans or animals.  Animal models of such conditions or the development or testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also are not eligible for support.  Biomedical engineering and healthcare engineering are supported in selected areas; see the current descriptions on the Engineering website: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501032&org=CBET&from=home">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501032&org=CBET&from=home</a>.</p>
          <p>EAPSI awards provide U.S. graduate students in science and engineering:  1) first-hand research experiences in partner locations, i.e., Australia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, or Taiwan; 2) an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and 3) an orientation to the society, culture, and language of these locations.  These goals are met through research visits that will help graduate students initiate scientific relationships to enable future collaboration with foreign counterparts. All institutes, except Japan, last approximately eight weeks from June to August. The institute in Japan lasts approximately ten weeks from June to August.</p>
          <p>EAPSI aims to provide an international experience to graduate students, particularly those who have never had one previously. Previous awardees may apply to a new host location, but priority will be given to new applicants. As this program is open to all research fields and disciplines supported by NSF, at a wide range of suitable research institutions, NSF will ensure appropriate distribution of fellowships across disciplinary fields and research sites. Members of groups under-represented in U.S. science, engineering, and STEM education are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
          <p>The East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes are administered in the United States by the National Science Foundation. In East Asia and the Pacific, the Summer Institutes are co-sponsored by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Australian Academy of Science;</li>
            <li>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and National Natural Science Foundation of China;</li>
            <li>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science;</li>
            <li>National Research Foundation of Korea;</li>
            <li>Royal Society of New Zealand; </li>
            <li>National Research Foundation of Singapore; and </li>
            <li>National Science Council of Taiwan.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first summer institute began in Japan in 1990, followed by Korea in 1995, Taiwan in 2000, China in 2003, Australia in 2004, New Zealand in 2007, and Singapore in 2008. The Summer Institute in Taiwan operates in accordance with the U.S.-Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8).</p>
          <p><strong>A. Key Elements</strong></p>
          <p>The EAPSI program is designed for U.S. graduate students wishing to conduct research in a foreign setting and to experience the culture of the host location. </p>
          <p>Foreign language capability is not required for acceptance into the EAPSI program; however, basic language training prior to the travel may contribute to a successful EAPSI experience.</p>
          <p>Before applying for the Summer Institutes, U.S. permanent residents should verify their ability to travel without difficulty outside of the United States and to Australia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, or Taiwan.</p>
          <p>The application requires a letter of reference (recommendation) from the student's advisor at the U.S. university.</p>
          <p>Applicants may indicate a second and third choice in the event their first choice is not possible. Only ONE potential host researcher may be identified per location in the application.</p>
          <p>Applicants must obtain an invitation or acceptance from their first choice foreign host researcher to conduct summer research in the host laboratory prior to submitting an application. Information on host locations and lists of potential host institutions may be found at the end of respective Handbooks available at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi">http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi</a>.</p>
          <p>Applicants are required to review information for their selected location in the respective Handbook on the EAPSI website <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi">http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi</a>. Information in the Handbooks is updated each year for the following year's programs, or as details become available. Additional questions about specific locations can be addressed to the Office of International and Integrative Activities whose program managers have expertise and experience specific to these locations: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/index.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/index.jsp</a>.</p>
          <p>Awardees must attend the Pre-Departure Orientation in the Washington, D.C. area, which is usually held in March or April. Expenses are paid by NSF.</p>
          <p>Awardees are responsible for preparing for certain aspects of their own travel, including but not limited to obtaining passports, visas, travel insurance, and any other requirements for travel. Likewise, they are responsible for making their own arrangements for necessary medications, immunizations, and health insurance. Awardees with chronic health conditions should consult their health care provider regarding the advisability of participating in a program which introduces cross-cultural and other physical stresses.</p>
          <p>At the conclusion of the Summer Institute, participants are encouraged to visit other research sites in their host location to learn about research being conducted in their field and to cultivate additional contacts for future collaborations. Such visits are scheduled in consultation with host researchers and foreign co-sponsoring organizations.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Program Conditions and Requirements</strong></p>
          <p>As a set of structured programs jointly funded and managed by NSF and foreign co-sponsoring organizations in the East Asia and Pacific region, all of the Summer Institutes operate in the same manner. All applications are submitted to NSF. Following merit review, NSF nominates its selected awardees to partner organizations and extends tentative offers to those selected applicants to verify that they will accept the fellowship if a final offer is made and that they agree to all conditions of the awards. NSF cannot make final award decisions unless and until the counterpart organizations and hosts concur in the nominations. Therefore, not all tentative offers are ultimately finalized.</p>
          <p>Applicants selected by NSF must ACCEPT the following terms and conditions before NSF will forward their nominations to the counterpart organizations. Participants must commit to attend the Summer Institute:</p>
          <ol>
        <li> in its entirety. Late arrivals and early departures are not allowed and participants must attend any opening and closing ceremonies. Tentative offers will include the dates of the select Summer Institute. </li><br />
         <li> unaccompanied. Due to varying visa requirements and the nature of the program, it is not appropriate for awardees to be accompanied by family and/or friends during the Summer Institutes. NSF and host organizations provide support and resources for awardees only; they cannot provide any support, service, or accommodation to other individuals. </li><br />
         <li>after attending the NSF orientation. Pre-Departure Orientation in Washington, DC is arranged for Fellows and expenses are paid by NSF. </li><br />
        <li> at the location assigned by the partner organization. NSF and the relevant foreign co-sponsoring organizations make every effort to finalize host arrangements as proposed by applicants; but placement with the requested host researcher cannot be guaranteed. Students are expected to accept placement with alternative host researchers as suggested by NSF and/or the foreign co-sponsoring organization. Any changes in the research plan must be approved both by NSF and the counterpart agency in advance of the change.</li><br />
        <li> with no overlap of Federal support. Participants may receive funding from only one federal source while participating in the EAPSI summer activity. If you currently receive salary or stipend from another federal source, including a fellowship or research and training grant, you must choose either the EAPSI stipend or the funding from the other federal source during the Summer Institute. </li><br />
         <li> after providing NSF contact information of someone in the U.S. in case of emergency while outside the U.S. </li></ol>
          <p><strong>Participants are representatives of NSF and the United States. Failure to adhere to any of the above terms and conditions or engagement in behavior that reflects negatively upon NSF or the United States may result in immediate dismissal from the program, immediate return home, and return of all award funds to NSF and the foreign co-sponsoring organization.</strong></p>

Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the GPG instructions.</p>
        <p>In cases where requirements given in this program solicitation differ from those given in the Grant Proposal Guide, this program solicitation takes precedence.</p>
        <p>All page limits indicated within this program solicitation include images, figures, graphics, tables, etc. Applicants must adhere to page limitations, NSF limits on font type and size, and margins (minimum of 1 inch on each side). Proposals that do not conform to the requirements will be returned without review.</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT SUBMISSION NOTES</strong>: Unlike most proposals to NSF, EAPSI proposals are submitted directly to NSF <strong>without going through the applicant's university</strong>. EAPSI proposals must be submitted electronically on the NSF FastLane website. Refer to the How to Apply Guide available at <a href="https://nsf.gov/eapsi">https://nsf.gov/eapsi</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
        <ol>
       <li> Go to NSF FastLane system, choose Postdoctoral Fellowships and Other Programs tab, Individual Registration, and register as an individual researcher: <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/n1/N1IndvReg.html?isScientist=GO">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/n1/N1IndvReg.html?isScientist=GO</a> In the FastLane application process for EAPSI, the applicant will be called a Principal Investigator (PI) or Proposer and <strong>must register as an 'individual researcher'</strong> acting as the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR). </li> <br />
   <li> After registering as an individual researcher, applicants must log in to FastLane under Postdoctoral Fellowships and Other Programs tab; click on PI/Co-PI Login Page button: <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/postdoc_fel.jsp">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/postdoc_fel.jsp</a></li><br />
        <li> Edit the PI Information form regarding citizenship. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents at the time of application and therefore are not permitted to select &quot;do not wish to provide&quot; in response to citizenship. Failure to provide citizenship information will result in the application being returned without review. </li><br />
      <li>The applicant must list the name of the Letter of Reference  Writer (applicant's advisor at the U.S. university) within the &quot;Add/Delete Letter of Reference Writers&quot; section in FastLane Proposal Preparation. This must be done <strong>BEFORE</strong> the applicant's advisor  can upload his or her letter into the FastLane system.  The advisor must log in as Letter of Reference Writer under NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships and Other Programs tab of FastLane <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/postdoc_fel.jsp">https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/postdoc_fel.jsp</a> to submit the recommendation letter.</li><br />
        <li> <strong>All</strong> proposal materials must be submitted via FastLane by the deadline. Materials sent via other means to NSF or received after the deadline will not be reviewed, considered, or accepted. </li><br />
      <li> EAPSI applications will be shared with foreign partner science agencies, and subsequently, with potential host researchers. Therefore, do not include any information in your application to which you would not want your host researcher or the foreign co-sponsoring organization to have access. </li><br />
        <li> Before selecting a host institution, applicants are advised to review lists of prospective hosts available at the end of the Handbooks on the EAPSI website <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi">http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi</a>. Applicants initiate contact with potential host researchers, establish communication, and if mutual commitment is established, obtain letter of invitation or acceptance from the host. Applicants to Japan should seek formal acceptance from a senior-level representative at the host institution (e.g., Professor, Director), even if the applicant's mentor may be a junior-level (e.g<em>.,</em> Assistant Professor) researcher at that institution. </li><br />
    <li> Students are strongly encouraged to seek information about potential foreign host researchers and institutions from their academic advisors, appropriate U.S. or foreign faculty members, or by contacting primary points of contact at foreign co-sponsoring organizations listed in the respective Handbooks. Students may also seek out host researchers by conducting literature searches and/or from host universities directly. Contact EAPSI Program Office <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi">http://www.nsf.gov/eapsi</a> if you wish to be hosted by an institution not listed in the respective Handbook. </li><br />
        <li> While preparing the application, applicants should keep in mind that the key to a successful EAPSI application and experience is developing clear, mutually agreed upon expectations about the proposed research project and sharing them with the host and the graduate advisor. </li><br />
        <li> If applicants have any questions about registering as an individual researcher or need assistance with submitting materials in FastLane, contact the FastLane Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:fastlane@nsf.gov">fastlane@nsf.gov</a> or 1-800-673-6188. </li><br /></ol>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>

        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
    <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
     
        <p>The review criteria above are for standard NSF proposals.  The EAPSI program will also consider the following additional criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Qualifications of applicant, including potential for continued growth and the probable effect of participation in the Summer Institute on the applicant&rsquo;s graduate training and career goals;</li>
          <li>Justification provided in the application for the selection of the host, including resources and capabilities of the proposed host institution(s) and researcher(s); </li>
          <li>NSF program priorities and efforts to broaden participation; and</li>
          <li>Merit, complementarities, and expected mutual benefits of the proposed international collaboration.</li>
        </ul>
 

       <a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Panel Review and/or Internal NSF Review.</p>
        
        <p>Applications will be screened for compliance with the requirements in this program solicitation; non-compliant applications will be returned without review. </p>
        <p>EAPSI is funded and managed in partnership with counterpart agencies in other countries; therefore, final selection of participants is dependent on mutual agreement between NSF and the counterparts. Thus, it is possible that an applicant who has been tentatively selected based on merit review may ultimately be declined.</p>
     
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
     
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

       <a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all EAPSI awards, participants are required to submit a final project report to the EAPSI Program Office by December 1 of the year in which they participated in the EAPSI program. This reporting requirement is in addition to any established by the participant's foreign co-sponsoring organization.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required final project report, or project outcomes report, to NSF will impact any future requests for funding as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of the NSF report.  The report will provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational) publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project.  Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.  The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov.  This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project.  This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.  </p>
    
        <p>The co-sponsoring organizations in Australia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan have independent reporting requirements and deadlines. EAPSI participants are expected to comply with the guidelines of foreign co-sponsoring organizations, in addition to those of NSF. </p>
        <p>EAPSI program staff may request at a future date that EAPSI participants provide evaluations of their experience.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
