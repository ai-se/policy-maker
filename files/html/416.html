        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Proposals are solicited to manage and operate facilities of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF). NRAO is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) that conceives, designs, builds, operates, and maintains world-class radio telescopes used by scientists from around the world to study virtually all types of astronomical objects, from bodies in our own Solar System to galaxies in the distant Universe. NRAO operates the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico; North American contributions to the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) located in Chile; and associated development laboratories, including a Central Development Laboratory (CDL) in Charlottesville, Virginia. Management and operation of two other NRAO facilities, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array, are under consideration separate from this solicitation.</p>
            <p>The Awardee will work closely with NSF and the scientific community to ensure that NRAO continues to support, sustain, and advance frontier science as enabled by unique research capabilities and as promoted through a culture of excellence. In cooperation with NSF and within available resources, the Awardee will plan and execute a viable, coherent, and inclusive program to support multi-user research and education, consistent with the objectives and priorities of the scientific community. The Awardee will manage facilities and equipment provided by NSF and by domestic and international partners, will provide additional facilities and equipment as necessary to fulfill the proposed programmatic scope, and will provide support and technical personnel to manage NRAO as a well-integrated facility to support research and education. The Observatory is a multi-user resource; as such, a significant portion of the NRAO research and education program should be carried out in collaboration with its stakeholder communities.</p>
            <p>Proposals should describe how the proposing institution(s) would provide observing capabilities and scientific data; enable a competitive research program and an integrated program of education, training and outreach; maintain instruments, facilities and infrastructure; manage and develop a skilled and diverse workforce; and establish appropriate partnerships with universities, industry, private organizations, and the international community to support the NRAO mission.</p>
            <p>The successful proposal will be awarded as a cooperative agreement for NRAO management and operations starting on 1 October 2016 for a duration of ten years contingent on the availability of funds and the successful outcome of regular management reviews. As necessary, the Awardee will define and execute a budgeted, scheduled, and tracked project plan to manage any transition from the current to the proposed model of NRAO management and operations. The transition period will commence with a transition award, under this cooperative agreement, on or after 1 April 2016 and conclude no later than 6 months thereafter.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF supports facilities that provide research capabilities in various scientific disciplines. One such facility, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), provides world-class services and facilities to support research and education in radio astronomy.</p>
          <p>NRAO is presently headquartered on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia. Major observing facilities currently include the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) located in Chile; the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) located near Socorro, New Mexico; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) located at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia; and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with antennas at ten sites in Hawaii, St. Croix, and across the continental United States. NRAO also operates a Central Development Laboratory (CDL) in Charlottesville that provides technology and expertise in supporting current and future radio astronomy instrumentation.</p>
          <p>NRAO is currently managed through a cooperative agreement with Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI). The National Science Board (NSB) has adopted the principle that NSF awards should be competed to assure the best use of NSF funds for supporting research and education (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2008/nsb0812_comp_recomp.pdf">NSB-08-12</a>). Through this program solicitation, NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) requests proposals for the management and operation of NRAO, as defined herein, through a cooperative agreement beginning on or after 1 April 2016 and continuing for up to ten years of operations following a transition period of up to six months. The award for NRAO management and operations will commence on 1 October 2016.</p>
          <p>In 2012 the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) conducted a Portfolio Review of all AST-supported facilities, programs, and other activities. The Review report recommended significant adjustments to the MPS/AST research portfolio, including divestment of some major telescope facilities, in order to maintain the most compelling scientific program within constrained budgets. ALMA and VLA were given high priority, while GBT and VLBA were among the facilities recommended for divestment. To sustain the scientific and operational synergies of ALMA and VLA, while allowing flexibility in pursuing operational and management models and partnerships for GBT and VLBA, NSF separated GBT and VLBA from the management competition for NRAO (<a href="http://nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13074/nsf13074.jsp">NSF 13-074</a>). Hence, this program solicitation invites proposals for the management and operation of an NRAO comprising ALMA, VLA, and associated support functions and development laboratories. Management and operation of Green Bank Observatory and of VLBA are not components of this solicitation and are under separate consideration. Services currently provided by Green Bank and VLBA staff and facilities in support of the scope described herein should not be assumed to be available to any proposer.</p>

          <p><strong>A.1 Overview of ALMA</strong></p>
          <p>ALMA is supported by an international partnership, comprising the U.S. and its partners Canada and Taiwan (hereinafter "North America" or NA), the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and Japan and its partner Taiwan (hereinafter "East Asia"), to construct and operate an interferometric radio telescope array in Chile. ALMA consists of fifty 12m antennas in an extended array, provided by NA and ESO, plus twelve 7m antennas and four 12m antennas in a compact array, provided by Japan. ALMA is located in the Chilean high desert near San Pedro de Atacama at an altitude of 5000m and can operate at frequencies from 80 to 900GHz. ALMA construction is due to be substantially completed in 2014, and Early Science observations commenced in 2011.</p>
          <p>ALMA enables transformational research into the physics of the cold Universe, regions that are optically dark but shine brightly in the millimeter/submillimeter portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. ALMA provides one to two orders of magnitude improvement over previous facilities in all areas of millimeter- and submillimeter-wave observations, including sensitivity, angular resolution, and image fidelity.</p>
          <p>ALMA is a general-purpose facility. Within the broad range of science accessible with ALMA, the top-level objectives include imaging the redshifted dust continuum and molecular line emission from evolving galaxies as early as a redshift of <em>z</em>~10 (500 million years after the Big Bang), determining the chemical composition and dynamics of star-forming gas in normal galaxies like the Milky Way but at a redshift of <em>z</em>~3 (75% of the way across the Universe), and measuring the gas kinematics in young disks in nearby molecular clouds and detecting the tidal gaps induced by planet formation.</p>
          <p>International agreements establish the terms under which the ALMA partnership operates and define the roles of the ALMA Board, the regional funding authorities, their Executives, and the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO). The ALMA Board acts as a supervisory and regulatory body responsible for exercising oversight and budgetary and policy control. The regional funding authorities (the "Parties") have each designated an Executive to carry out and manage tasks and responsibilities on behalf of the Parties. ESO serves as its own Executive. The East Asian ALMA Executive is the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The Awardee will function as the NA ALMA Executive.</p>
          <p>The JAO, staffed by the Executives and headed by the ALMA Director, provides the unified leadership and management of ALMA operations, maintenance, and development. JAO headquarters are located in the Santiago Central Office (SCO) on ESO property in Santiago, Chile. The ALMA Director is appointed by, and reports to the ALMA Board, and can be employed by any of the Executives. The ALMA Director meets with the Directors of the Executives, or their designates, in the Director's Council to coordinate activities among the Executives and the JAO. The necessary scientific and technical interactions and support of the respective regional user communities occur through ALMA Regional Centers (ARCs) operated and managed by the Executives. NRAO provides the NA ARC.</p>
          <p>The Resource Library includes the current International Agreements: between NSF and ESO (the ALMA "bilateral agreement") for construction and operation; among NSF, ESO and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan (the ALMA "trilateral agreement") for construction; between NSF and the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada for construction and operation; and between NSF and the National Science Council (NSC) of Taiwan, as the designated representatives of the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, for construction. A fully trilateral International Agreement for ALMA Operations among NSF, ESO, and NINS/NAOJ is under development and intended to be effective from January 2015.</p>
          <p>The Resource Library also includes bilateral management agreements between the NA Executive and ESO, and between the NA Executive and NAOJ, which describe the manner in which the Executives work together to realize ALMA, as well as the agreement between NRC Herzberg and NRAO/AUI that further describes the contributions by NRC Herzberg to NA ALMA operations. An ALMA land concession was granted by the Government of Chile to the NA Executive and ESO through a limited liability company established in Chile for that purpose. AUI's ownership interest in that company may be conveyed to a successor organization with ESO's consent. A fully trilateral management agreement, paralleling the new trilateral International Agreement for ALMA Operations, is planned to be developed and effective in 2015.</p>
          <p>In addition to employing international staff at the JAO, the Parties have designated the NA Executive to be the sole employer of the local staff in Chile on behalf of the partnership. The Parties may jointly agree to change this designation. The NA Executive supports the JAO in employment functions and contract and procurements in Chile, and provides the legal representation of the NA partners to the Republic of Chile. Each ALMA Executive remains solely legally responsible for its own employees.</p>
          <p><strong>A.2 Components of North American ALMA Operations </strong></p>
          <p>NA ALMA operations may be considered to consist of four elements: (a) a share of core operations in Chile, (b) core technical and NA user community support at the NA ARC, (c) a share of the facility and technical development program, and (d) enhanced user support, technical concept studies, and education and public outreach.</p>
          <p>As an international project, the scope and budget for these elements are constrained by the partnership as broadly outlined in the following table and described further below:</p>

          </table>
          <p>Through the ALMA Board, the Directors Council, and other international partnership forums, the NA Executive and NRAO have the opportunity to contribute to evolution of the scope and distribution of the budget among the operations elements.</p>
          <p>Elements (a) through (c) have been identified by the ALMA partnership as a common set of functions necessary to support operation, maintenance, development, and scientific use of the facility. They are funded by each international partner in proportion to their participation in the project (37.5%, 37.5% and 25% for North America, Europe and East Asia, respectively). Together, these elements form the core ALMA Operations Plan (AOP) which is under the approval authority of the international ALMA Board. The ALMA Parties and ALMA Board have recognized that there will continue to be a maturing of the Operations Plan as experience is gained with the facility. The support functions in element (d) were separated from the AOP and the approval authority of the ALMA Board because those services vary and are provided and funded via disparate routes, not necessarily through the Parties and Executives, in the different regions. </p>
          <p>The ALMA Director is responsible for managing day-to-day operations in Chile (element a) within the approved budget.</p>
          <p>NRAO is responsible for offsite (outside of Chile) operations activities (elements b and c) under the coordination of the ALMA Director. The budget for elements (a) through (c) is developed annually by the ALMA Director and the Executives under guidance provided by the AOP and the Parties, and is presented to the ALMA Board for approval.  </p>
          <p>NRAO is responsible for execution of the NA user support and maintenance plans. Offsite user support (element b) includes support for the international observing proposal process, assistance for individual observers in the preparation of their observations, access to the raw and processed data through a NA mirror archive, an on-line helpdesk, and a visiting observer program. Offsite technical support (element b) includes high-level maintenance and repair of the hardware and software delivered to ALMA by the NA Executive. The requirements for this element are described in the current AOP and in statements of maintenance principles and maintenance plans, all of which are included in the Resource Library.</p>
          <p>A science-driven program of technical and facility upgrades and the development of new capabilities is recognized as important to maintain ALMA as a state-of-the-art facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomy. NRAO is responsible for oversight of projects conducted under the NA development program. A statement of development principles is included in the Resource Library. NRAO periodically issues solicitations for development projects which may be conducted within or outside NRAO and in partnership with domestic and international institutions. There are three NA development projects currently underway: a phased-ALMA capability as the high-sensitivity component of a mm-wavelength Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network, contributions to the ESO-led Band 5 (163-211GHz) receiver project, and a high-bandwidth fiber-optic link between the ALMA site and the city of Calama.  </p>
          <p>For reference, the ALMA Board-approved (calendar year) 2013 budget for elements (a) through (c) is $68,330,000 of which the NA share is $25,623,750. To this NA share NRC Herzberg (Canada) contributed approximately $1,100,000 and in-kind operations support. The NA development program budget is planned to ramp up from about $2,200,000 in 2013 to a steady-state level of about $5,700,000 in 2015. However, as the cost of Chilean operations and maintenance and support needs may evolve and fluctuate, for example due to exchange rates, the specific budgets for the individual elements are tensioned within the overall envelope.</p>
          <p>Element (d) may encompass a variety of activities such as support for NA user community data processing; science and technical workshops; tutorials and educational resources for users; postdoctoral and student programs; and an education and public outreach program. In addition, NRAO periodically issues solicitations for development concept studies in order to seed the primary development program. As with the primary development program, these studies may be conducted within or outside NRAO. NRAO is responsible for their oversight. The scope of element (d) activities is constrained by the available budget and tensioned against the budgets for Chilean operations, technical and core user support, and the development program. Subject to these constraints, it is envisioned that the budget for element (d) activities will be approximately 20% of the total.</p>
          <p>The overall budget target under this award for the NSF-supported component of FY 2017 NA ALMA operations is $43,250,000, which includes all aspects of management and operations (elements a through d) and excludes support from NA partners. The cost of providing power (generated on-site at ALMA) is yet to be finalized in steady-state operations but is recognized to be larger than envisioned in the AOP. The additional cost of power is provided for within this overall NA budget.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of proposal preparation only, the FY2017 ALMA budget target of $43,250,000 may be allocated between the four elements of scope as follows: (a) core operations in Chile $19,750,000; (b) core NA technical and user support $11,000,000; (c) NA development program $4,500,000; (d) NA enhanced user support, technical studies, education and outreach $8,000,000.</p>
          <p><strong>A.3 Overview of the VLA</strong></p>
          <p>The VLA is the world's leading centimeter-wavelength radio telescope. It consists of twenty-seven 25m antennas in a Y-shaped reconfigurable array located on the Plains of San Agustin, fifty miles west of the headquarters and support facilities at the Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center (DSOC) in Socorro, New Mexico. Originally constructed in the 1970s, the VLA completed a major overhaul in early 2013 including a new suite of 1-50GHz receivers, a digital data collection and transmission system, a flexible wide-bandwidth correlator provided by NRC Herzberg, and a financial contribution from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The improvement over previous performance is up to a factor of 10 in continuum sensitivity and coarsest frequency resolution, and a factor of 1000 or more in finest frequency resolution and the number of frequency channels. Full science operations were initiated in January 2013. Development and scientific commissioning of advanced correlator modes is continuing.</p>
          <p>The VLA is a general-purpose facility, providing observing capabilities complementary to ALMA and explicitly addressing four primary science themes: measuring the strength and topology of cosmic magnetic fields; imaging young stars and massive black holes in dust-enshrouded environments; following the rapid evolution of energetic phenomena; and studying the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Annually the VLA receives about 500 observing proposals from over 1000 users. Approximately 200 refereed papers are published with VLA data each year.</p>
          <p>The VLA Visitor Center houses educational exhibits, a small theater, and a gift shop.</p>
          <p>The Resource Library includes the close-out report from the expanded VLA construction project and a summary of maintenance, upgrade, and enhancement plans.</p>
          <p><strong>A.4 Components of VLA Operations</strong></p>
          <p>Funding for the VLA under this award encompasses all aspects of management and operations. These include the scientific, technical, and administrative functions necessary to maintain, operate, and develop the array and its infrastructure, to support the user community, and to conduct an education and public outreach program. As with ALMA, the VLA is intended to be a telescope usable by all astronomers, not just interferometry experts. Most astronomers use the telescope remotely. User support activities include conducting an observing proposal and time allocation process; assisting users with observation preparation and data processing; and data quality control, access, and archiving. As constrained by the available budget, user support activities may also include science and technical workshops, tutorials and educational resources for users, and postdoctoral and student programs.</p>
          <p>The budget target under this award for FY 2017 VLA operations is $29,500,000.</p>
          <p><strong>A.5 NRAO Development Laboratories</strong></p>
          <p>The operating facilities are supported and enriched by associated development laboratories. A Central Development Laboratory (CDL) is currently located in Charlottesville, Virginia, with other development activities located in Socorro, New Mexico.</p>
          <p>The development laboratories provide technical expertise for the maintenance and repair of the existing instrumentation and conduct a science-driven program of research and development in critical technologies needed for the next generation instrumentation and facilities. The technologies include signal processing, digitization of receiver systems, cryogenic phased array feeds, cluster computing, and parallel processing of large datasets and data processing algorithms. Technology development is conducted in close partnership with the astronomy community in universities and institutes in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
          <p>The budget target under this award in FY 2017 for the development laboratories is $2,500,000, excluding work performed for ALMA (described in A.2). Funding for major development projects would need to be sought separately from eligible NSF programs such as the Mid-Scale Innovations Program in Astronomical Sciences, or from other funding sources.</p>
          <p><strong>A.6 NRAO Administration and Management</strong></p>
          <p>Administration and management is currently based in Charlottesville, Virginia, with some cross-observatory as well as local functions performed at the NRAO sites. The administration and management activities include business services, procurements, human resources, environment, safety and health, site management, and the office of the Director.</p>
          <p>Funding for all administrative and management functions is provided for within the budget targets stated for ALMA, the VLA, and the development laboratories.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Description of Awardee Responsibilities</strong></p>
          <p><strong>B.1 Core Expectations</strong></p>
          <p>As the NRAO managing organization, the Awardee will work closely with NSF and the scientific research community to ensure that, within available resources, NRAO supports, sustains, and advances frontier science as enabled by NRAO's unique research capabilities and as promoted through a culture of excellence. The Awardee will be accountable for fulfilling the NRAO mission through a visionary strategy that capitalizes on the federal investment to serve the scientific community and to promote world-class research and education. The NRAO program should embody the NSF Vision: <em>a Nation that creates and exploits new concepts in science and engineering and provides global leadership in research and education.</em></p>
          <p>The Awardee will be responsible for the overall management and performance of NRAO, including the infrastructure, instrumentation and staff, and for maximizing the benefits to the scientific research community within available resources through a strategically planned scope of activities.

Organizational structures for NRAO management and operations may include the establishment of new institutions, corporations, or consortia, provided that the proposing organization(s) provide materials in support of the financial capability of the Awardee(s), as required in Section V.B.</p>
          <p>Consistent with the proposed vision, goals, and objectives for NRAO, the Awardee will establish and maintain an effective governance and advisory structure to provide guidance, advice, and oversight for all NRAO activities. The Awardee's advisory structure should enable diverse representation from all sectors served by NRAO, and should include mechanisms to assess and advise on all aspects of NRAO, including large facility management and operations, research, education and outreach, technical capabilities, data management, project management, and human resources and workforce development.</p>
          <p>The Awardee will establish processes within a structured framework for budgeting, planning, review, and performance management, including the development and use of appropriate mechanisms to measure, assess, and improve organizational performance in all functional areas. The Awardee's planning and performance management processes will provide transparency to NSF and to NRAO stakeholder communities of NRAO's activities and achievements versus established plans, milestones, and objectives. </p>
          <p>As appropriate, the Awardee will develop partnerships or arrangements, for example with universities/colleges, national laboratories, research museums, private sector research laboratories and observatories, industry, state and local government laboratories, and international collaborations, that enable NRAO to attain its strategic goals. Partner institutions may invest intellectual or other resources in NRAO activities and work collaboratively with the Awardee and NSF to ensure that NRAO fulfills all aspects of its mission. The Awardee is responsible for planning, operating, and managing all NRAO activities, including contributions provided by partnering organizations.</p>
          <p>Programs using NRAO resources, including non-NSF-funded activities, must be consistent with the NRAO mission and complement and enhance activities funded and approved by NSF. Voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.</p>
          <p>The Awardee is responsible for complying with all applicable laws of the location in which it operates. Accordingly, proposers should seek their own counsel regarding the laws of Chile. As a starting point, proposers should familiarize themselves with Chile law No. 15,172 and No. 17,318 and consider conducting provisional consultations with an appropriate representative of the University of Chile. Other laws with which proposers should also familiarize themselves include, but are not limited to, Chile laws regarding labor and employment.</p>
          <p><em>Specific Duties</em></p>

          <p>The profile adopts an escalation factor derived from consideration of projections for inflation factors for U.S. wage earners and including the complexities of planning operating costs in Chile with Chilean inflation and legal requirements for employee salary increases. The escalation is intended to maintain a constant level of purchasing power.</p>
          <p>The profile is for planning purposes only. Actual annual funding increments will be determined on the basis of annual program operating plans submitted by the Awardee to NSF and approved by NSF and the ALMA Board, subject to the availability of appropriated funds and to the performance of both the Awardee and NRAO.</p>
          <p>In this solicitation, NRAO may be considered to consist of several components as described in the following sections: ALMA; VLA; CDL and other development laboratories; and associated administration and management functions. The budget targets under this award in FY 2017 are $43,250,000 (ALMA), $29,500,000 (VLA), and $2,500,000 (development laboratories), for a total of $75,250,000. Administration and management costs are included in these amounts. In order to ensure appropriate financial and management oversight and tracking, it is envisioned that the award will be made as one cooperative agreement with two separate cooperative support agreements, one for ALMA and the other for VLA plus development laboratories. The cooperative agreement will be the umbrella agreement of the awards and the cooperative support agreements will cover specific terms and conditions for ALMA and VLA plus development laboratories.</p>
          <p>The overall budget target under this award for the NSF-supported component of FY 2017 NA ALMA operations is $43,250,000, which includes all aspects of management and operations and excludes support from NA partners. For the purposes of proposal preparation only, the FY 2017 ALMA budget target of $43,250,000 may be allocated between the four elements of scope as follows: (a) core operations in Chile $19,750,000; (b) core NA technical and user support $11,000,000; (c) NA development program $4,500,000; (d) NA enhanced user support, technical studies, education, and outreach $8,000,000.</p>
          <p>To support any transition from the current to the proposed model of NRAO management and operations, NSF will fund additional, appropriate transition costs through a cooperative support agreement with the Awardee for a transition period of up to six months preceding the ten year award period for operations. Relevant transition activities include, but are not limited to, interviewing and hiring personnel, assigning subcontracts, relocating observatory support functions, transferring data and property, obtaining permits and licenses, and developing management agreements with the other ALMA Executives. During this transition period, the Awardee will have appropriate access to NRAO and ALMA personnel and facilities.</p>

         <h4>
          B. Budgetary Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
        <p>Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>Proposing organizations may include a fixed annual management fee in their proposed budget, and must include a brief justification for the fee in the budget justification. The management fee must be clearly identified as such.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Budget Preparation Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p>The full proposal should include a budget for each year of the ten-year operational period (FY 2017-26) proposed. The first-year budget should total $75,250,000. Each subsequent year should be escalated by 3% per year. FastLane and Grants.gov will automatically provide a cumulative budget.</p>
        <p>The proposal should provide all staffing and budgeting information needed to describe how the organization would fulfill the Awardee responsibilities in Section II of this solicitation. Requested budget amounts for each year of the proposal should reflect the level considered necessary to perform the NSF-funded activities described in the proposal. Proposers should also be cognizant of budget constraints implied by the estimated funding levels provided under Section III.</p>
        <p>A budget justification, not to exceed 20 pages, should be submitted in support of the budgets for the first five years only and shall be in sufficient detail and with stated basis of estimate to show how the proposer reached the amounts specified in the budget. NSF anticipates performing a detailed cost analysis of the successful proposal budget.</p>
        <p>Enter the anticipated total level of subcontract support on line G5, Subawards, of the FastLane budget or line F5 of the R&amp;R Budget Form in Grants.gov. Full proposals require the inclusion of separate budgets for subcontracts that exceed $250,000 per year. For subcontracts that would be less than $250,000 year, include the costs in the aggregate on the subaward line in the budget.</p>
        <p>All proposing organizations must also provide a detailed budget for a transition period of up to six months preceding the award for full NRAO operations. This information must be provided in an Appendix labeled <strong>Transition Budget </strong>and submitted as Supplementary Documentation. The budget must be presented in the same style with all applicable budget line items as for the budget for each year of the proposal. If a new Awardee is selected to manage and operate NRAO, the incumbent will cooperate with the successor to the extent necessary to facilitate uninterrupted support for NRAO during the transition period and will provide transfer of legal rights to relevant property and equipment.</p>
        <p><strong><em>The transition budget should not include non-renewal costs of the incumbent, including medical insurance, severance pay, or other costs incurred by the incumbent under the current cooperative agreement, including costs related to the nonrenewal of subcontracts. If a new operator is selected, the incumbent may submit to NSF costs related to the cooperative agreement non-renewal, and these costs will be considered separately.</em></strong></p>
        <p>In an Appendix labeled<strong> Financial Capability,</strong> entered via the Single Copy Documents section of FastLane under "Additional Single Copy Documents," proposing organizations must provide the following in support of the organization's financial condition and capability:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A detailed structure and plan for implementing and monitoring business systems and internal controls for financial management and accounting, property standards, equipment standards, procurement standards, reporting, and records management.</li>
          <li>Total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees, with supporting information such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys, and studies of professional, public, and private organizations used in establishing the total compensation structure.</li>
          <li>If available, the organization's annual audited financial statements (e.g. Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Statement, and Annual Reports) for the three most recent fiscal years and/or other documentation to clearly explain its current financial strength and resource capability.</li>
          <li>A current indirect cost rate proposal and supporting financial data. If the organization's indirect cost rates have been approved by another Federal agency, provide copies of such agreements. NSF does not participate in or contribute to the cost of Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) and such costs shall bear a proportionate share of overhead and G&amp;A costs; therefore, IR&amp;D costs should be excluded from indirect expense pools and included in the appropriate distribution bases. If the organization has no IR&amp;D costs, a statement to that effect should be included with the indirect cost rate proposal;</li>
          <li>A current Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) Disclosure Statement or Cost Policy Statement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organizations that have not previously received NSF awards should review the NSF Prospective New Awardee Guide <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pnag/nsf1162.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pnag/nsf1162.pdf</a> for additional guidance in preparing their budget submission.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
      
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
     <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a>  <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>For this solicitation, the following additional and specific review criteria will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>

       <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>The panel review will have access to the ad hoc reviews, and with its own deliberations will formulate an overall evaluation of each proposal. The reviewers will include experts in all areas of consideration as identified in the Additional Solicitation-Specific Review Criteria, including individuals experienced in the management of complex scientific and technical organizations. Following external review, strengths and weaknesses of each proposal as identified by the reviewers will be further evaluated in formal meetings of the proposing organizations with the Cognizant Program Officers and other NSF staff.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
   
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
        <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>As described below, the Awardee will be required to provide annual management reports and quarterly and annual reports for all NRAO programs, inclusive of VLA, ALMA, and all associated support functions and development laboratories, along with other reports as may be required by NSF. Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), NSF is required to report on the Federal Performance Goals for Facilities. Any and all facilities with an annual budget exceeding a specific threshold must report on their operations activities; and any and all construction/upgrade projects that exceed a total project cost of a specific threshold must report on their construction/upgrade activities. Therefore, the Awardee will be required, upon request of the cognizant NSF program officer, to submit annual reports related to the GPRA performance goals. This may include the collection and submission of specific data related to the NSF GPRA requirements.</p>
        <p>The Awardee shall submit an <em>Annual Management Report</em> that describes its performance, separate from that of the facility, against the expectations and statement of work and including performance measures as proposed. This report will be considered as the Annual Report in Research.gov, and the NSF Program Officer's approval of this report will be required prior to issuance of scheduled funding for the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>The Awardee shall submit a <em>Strategic Plan</em>, updated approximately every three years, that describes the vision, goals, and objectives for NRAO during the period of the cooperative agreement and in the longer term.</p>
        <p>The Awardee shall submit an annual <em>Program Operating Plan</em> (POP) for NSF review for each upcoming fiscal year. The POP shall describe the principal activities to be undertaken during the year and include milestones, objectives, targets, deliverables, financial and staffing plans, maintenance plans, key decision points, and anticipated risks and mitigation plans. The POP will serve as a basline for assessing variances between planned and actual activities and for identifying and managing emerging risks and opportunities.</p>
        <p>The Awardee shall submit annually a <em>Long Range Plan</em> (LRP) that describes the principal activities to be undertaken during the five-year period subsequent to the POP, in order to support the objectives of the Strategic Plan. The LRP will be based on budget guidance provided by NSF.</p>
        <p>An <em>Annual Program Report</em> for the prior fiscal year shall be submitted for NSF review after the end of each fiscal year. The report shall describe progress against the POP based on milestones, objectives, targets, and deliverables. The report will highlight scientific, technical, and other achievements; describe notable decisions and outcomes; provide financial data, including program income and spending; and present metrics of time allocation, telescope usage, data management, and publications, as well as other performance measures as proposed. Progress on infrastructure maintenance and renewal shall be discussed. Significant variances between planned and actual activities and outcomes shall be described.</p>
        <p><em>Quarterly Status Reports</em> should summarize interim progress during the preceding quarter against the POP and highlight scientific achievements, significant variances between the planned and actual activities, risks and proposed mitigation plans, and ongoing metrics as identified for the Annual Program Report. The quarterly status reports will be in the form of briefings to NSF with the written material from the briefings submitted through Research.gov. The briefings should be held approximately 45 days after the end of a quarter.</p>
        <p>In its role as employer of the local staff in Chile, the Awardee shall provide regular reports to the ALMA parties, other Executives, and the ALMA Director regarding significant developments concerning local staff matters.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
