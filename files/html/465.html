<a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div><p>Within the current administrative structure of most American universities, research and education in the space sciences does not fall under the purview of any particular department (i.e., physics, astronomy, geophysics, electrical engineering, applied mathematics) or even faculty (arts and science, engineering).  It therefore comes as no surprise that the last several decades have witnessed a gradual erosion of faculty positions that are principally devoted to the education and training of future space scientists. At the same time, space scientists are becoming more valuable to our society as we rely more heavily upon technical systems sensitive to conditions in the space environment, such as the electronic workplace, global positioning systems and high-speed communications networks. Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution are significantly affected by Space Weather, and the climatology of the near-Earth space environment. The ability to forecast disturbances which may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, comprising the disciplines of solar physics, heliospheric physics, magnetospheric physics and aeronomy.</p><p>This solicitation provides both support and incentive for universities to reverse this trend, and to create new tenure-track faculty positions in the space sciences.  Awards under this program are designed to provide partial salary, start-up funding, and research support for new faculty members. With this Program Solicitation, the National Science Foundation addresses the recommendation that the Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics of the National Research Council presented in their recent decadal survey that NSF continues and expands the faculty development program that was initiated with the original solicitation in 2004 (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13060">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13060</a>). </p></div>
<h3>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will have as their principal objective the creation and support of a single tenure-track faculty position, bearing teaching, educational outreach, and research responsibilities. The faculty position may reside within one department or be shared between several departments. In either case, the proposal must clearly state how topics in space physics will be integrated into the graduate and undergraduate courses offered by the department(s), and it should outline a plan for the development of a space physics graduate program if no such program presently exists.</p><p>The proposal should make clear how the position will be integrated into the institution's overall strategic plan. It should set specific goals and milestones to gauge the overall efficacy of the integration and educational outreach. A specific evaluation plan should be presented in the proposal. It will be critical for the institution to state in full the measures it will take to ensure the successful integration of the faculty position.</p><p>The proposal should not designate any candidate for the new faculty position, but a description of the desired skills, background and training of the successful candidate should be included. Particular emphasis will be placed upon evaluating the:             </p><ul><li>Clear articulation of how the faculty position will be integrated into the university program of education, outreach and research.                </li><li>Plan for space physics curriculum development. </li><li>Potential for the faculty position to attract capable students and train future scientists in space physics.</li><li>Plan for developing partnerships both within the university and the space sciences community.       </li><li>Metrics developed to ascertain the success of the program.</li><li>Pro-active activities to foster participation by women and underrepresented groups.</li></ul><p>The proposal should contain a description of how the job search would be carried out. It is required that the search be open and adequately publicized. Consonant with the stated policies of the National Science Foundation, women, minorities and other underrepresented groups should be strongly encouraged to apply.</p><p>Once a specific candidate is determined by the university, NSF will decide if the proposed research program and qualifications of the candidate meet the requirements of NSF's review criteria <strong>and</strong> addresses the stated objectives of this solicitation. The successful candidate will be added to the grant as a Co-Principal Investigator.   Funding will not start until the candidate is selected and approved. </p><p>The duration of the grant  may not exceed five years (60 months).  If used for an entry-level position, the duration must be sufficient to allow the candidate to stand for tenure review at or before the end of the award period. </p><p>Principal Investigators should be someone at the university with the authority to implement the proposed program and select and hire the new faculty member. These may be, but are not limited to, a Dean, a Provost, a Director of a university associated research institute, a Department Chairperson, or a senior tenured faculty member.</p>

  <h3>VI.  NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.  Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards.  A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the GPG as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3ex1.pdf">Exhibit III-1</a>.</p><p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p><p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/strategicplan/nsfstrategicplan_2011_2016.pdf"><em>Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation: NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2016</em></a>.  These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part.  NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.    </p><p>One of the core strategies in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects and activities it supports at academic and research institutions.  These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the variety of learning perspectives.  </p><p>Another core strategy in support of NSF's mission is broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.  NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<a name="reviewcrit" title="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education.  To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.&quot;  NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.  </p><p>1. Merit Review Principles</p><p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p><ul><li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.<br />  </li><li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These &quot;Broader Impacts&quot; may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.<br />  </li><li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project. </li></ul><p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project.  Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p><p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p><p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p><p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient.  Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria.  (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a> contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.)  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2di">GPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i.</a>, prior to the review of a proposal.</p><p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful.  These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.  To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: </p><ul><li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and<br />  </li><li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. </li></ul><p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria: </p><ol><li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to <ol type="a"><li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and </li><li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)? </li></ol></li><li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? </li><li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?  Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success? </li><li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities? </li><li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities? </li></ol><p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project.  NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. </p><p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p><p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>Particular emphasis will be placed upon evaluating the:</p><ul><li>Clear articulation of how the faculty position will be integrated into the university program of education, outreach and research. </li><li>Plan for space physics curriculum development. </li><li>Potential for the faculty position to attract capable students and train future scientists in space physics.</li><li>Plan for developing partnerships both within the university and the space sciences community. </li><li>Metrics developed to ascertain the success of the program.</li><li>Pro-active activities to foster participation by women and underrepresented groups.</li></ul></p>
<h4>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.  The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p><h3>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p><h4>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4><p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Research Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p><p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special Award Conditions: </strong></p>
<p>It is expected that the PIs will initiate a job search to determine an appropriate  candidate to fill the tenure-track faculty position. When the candidate  is indentified, the PI will provide the cognizant Program Officer with a  synopsis of the search process, including, but not limited to:</p>  <ol><li>A curriculum vitae,   </li><li>A publication list, and   </li><li>A statement of research interests, and proposed educational outreach and teaching plans,  of the successful candidate.</li></ol>  <p>NSF reserves the right to approve or reject this  selection based upon the intent of this solicitation. The award will be made based on the ability of the proposing  organization to (1) hire the successful candidate who emerges from the  open job search, and (2) agree to put this candidate forward for  consideration for tenure at or before the conclusion of the award.   After the candidate has been hired and the award has been made, the  proposing institution should request (via FastLane) that the successful  candidate be added as a co-PI to the award.</p>  <p>If at any time during the award, the candidate hired into the new  Space Science faculty line should terminate their association with the  award, the cognizant Program Officer will have the discretion  to terminate the award, or permit the organization to open a new search  process to fill the vacant position. If a new candidate is selected by  such a process, the NSF reserves the right to approve or reject this  selection based upon the intent of this solicitation.</p>

<h4>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4><p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). Within 90 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p><p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p><p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports.  Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p><p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p><p>The annual and final project reports for the award are required to explicitly address the strategic goals for the strengthening and integration of space physics in the department(s) involved in the new faculty position.  This should include, but is not limited to, a description of the progress achieved on these objectives as well as an evaluation of the advances made according to the metrics for this that were outlined in the proposal, including any modifications or additions to these that may have been required during the review and award process. </p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p><p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p><p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p><p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p><p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p><p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" width="590" align="center" bgcolor="#e9e9e9"><tbody><tr><td><p>The National Science Foundation promotes and advances scientific progress in the United States by competitively awarding grants and cooperative agreements for research and education in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.</p><p>To get the latest information about program deadlines, to download copies of NSF publications, and to access abstracts of awards, visit the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">https://www.nsf.gov</a></p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="90%" align="center"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>Location:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>4201 Wilson Blvd. Arlington, VA 22230</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>For General Information<br /></strong>(NSF Information Center)<strong>:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5111</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>TDD (for the hearing-impaired):</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5090</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>To Order Publications or Forms:</strong></li></ul></td><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td height="25" align="middle" valign="top"><p>Send an e-mail to:</p></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p><a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td height="25" align="middle" valign="top"><p>or telephone:</p></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-7827</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycopy" height="25" align="left" valign="top"><ul><li><strong>To Locate NSF Employees:</strong></li></ul></td><td height="25" align="left" valign="top"><p>(703) 292-5111</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>
