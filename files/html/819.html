<h3><a NAME="DESC">II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</a></h3>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000>The MPS Internships in Public Science Education (IPSE) program is intended to bring science research results from MPS disciplines to the public by promoting partnerships between the MPS research community and professionals in public science education.  By its very nature, public science education is intended to reach far beyond the boundaries of the universities, colleges, and research centers where the research is carried out, and to bring to the general public a broader awareness of science, its methods, and its most exciting results.  Science centers and museums play an important role in informing and educating society by providing an effective mechanism that brings current, accurate, and compelling scientific concepts and discoveries to the public. The IPSE activity will provide support for undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers to work in conjunction with MPS research scientists and with professionals at science centers and museums on projects to meet this goal.</P><P>IPSE activities should be designed to increase the museum or science center's effectiveness in outreach and public science education through specific projects or exhibits that bring new scientific ideas to museum programming. Examples might include, but are not limited to, the development of new or expanded exhibits or the creation of programs such as museum shows and public lectures.  IPSE is not intended to support K-12 curriculum development or teacher training; these kinds of activites are supported by other programs within NSF.  In all cases, the projects proposed should demonstrate the active involvement of both research scientists and science center or museum staff in the planning and execution of the project.  Because this activity is intended to reach a broad public, and the development of exhibits and programming involves the skills and talents of many people, IPSE is open to students and teachers of all disciplines, including art, writing, museum studies, education, history, as well as science and mathematics.  The involvement of minority-serving institutions and the development of projects that serve diverse populations are encouraged.</P><P>IPSE is intended to encourage effective partnerships between the MPS research community and science centers and museums.  Therefore, proposals should show evidence of active collaborative planning among all the institutions and individuals involved and a commitment to develop an effective and sustained working relationship among the partner institutions.  Proposals will be accepted from individuals or groups of faculty members at universities and colleges working with a local science center or museum, from a science center or museum working with departments at a university or college, or from MPS-supported research centers, facilities, or institutes with an outreach or educational program.  </P><P>Proposals must show the active involvement of both a research scientist or scientists in one of the MPS disciplines (astronomy, chemistry, materials research, mathematical sciences, and physics) and science center professionals.  Research scientists involved in the projects serve as consultants to the science centers or museums and as scientific advisors to the participants.   Museum and science center staff serve as advisors on issues of outreach and education and provide structure and oversight of activities.  The participants in the program should have clearly defined activities that exemplify the integration of education and research. The program may include either summer or academic year activities or a combination of both.  </P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></P></FONT>

addition to presenting details of projects that meet the goals of the
activity as described in Section II above, proposals are expected to address
the following points in the project description (Proposal Section C).  In
what follows, participants are defined as those undergraduate or graduate
students or K-12 teachers who serve in the capacity of interns for the
proposed projects.  </P><P>1) Nature of participant activities: Proposals
must <BR><ul><li> present plans for participant intern activities, which are
expected to focus on one or more specific projects.  Participants are not to
serve as general summer or year-round help, but are to contribute to the
development or implementation of specific projects;  <BR><li> provide a clear
description of each participant's role in the project and the nature of his
or her work;<BR><li> describe plans for interaction among student/teacher
interns, the research scientist, and the museum and science center
staff;<BR><li> present a clear schedule for participant activities, including
the nature of summer and/or academic year involvement.</ul></P><P>2)
Recruitment and selection of participants: Proposals must <BR><ul><li>
describe plans for participant recruitment and selection, including what
effort will be made to attract members of underrepresented groups.  If
candidate students or teachers have been identified at the time of the
proposal, a brief biographical sketch for each participant should be included
in Proposal Section E; <BR><li> present details on the number of planned
participants and the nature of their qualifications. </ul></P><P>3) Project
Outcome and Evaluation: Proposals must <BR><ul><li> describe plans for

or more co-principal investigators, should address explicitly plans for
project management, sustained activity beyond the grant period, and project
maintenance and continued staffing as necessary.  </P><P>4) Proposal Budget:
The proposal should include a detailed project budget and budget
justification.  The budget justification should explain and justify major
cost items, any unusual situations, requests for equipment or materials, and
any proposed institutional cost sharing.  Project costs may include items
such as salary for faculty or senior personnel, participant housing, travel,
or use of computing facilities, equipment or exhibit material, and material
for project dissemination.  The presentation of results at professional
meetings is encouraged and requests for participant travel to meetings for
presentations is expected as part of the intern experience.  Requests for
salary support for the PI and co-PI should be entered under Senior Personnel
(line A), but support for interns should be entered under Participant Support
Costs (line F) of the budget pages.  Participants are defined as those
undergraduate or graduate students or K-12 teachers who are serving in the
capacity of interns for the project.  </P><P>As a guide to budget
preparation, undergraduate student stipends for summer projects are expected
to be comparable to those of Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU,
NSF01-121) participants, typically at least $300 per week, with academic year
stipends calculated on a pro rata basis. This is a guideline figure, neither
a floor nor a ceiling.   Salary support for teachers should be based on their
annualized salaries, and may include up to 2 months of summer support.
Graduate student stipends may include fringe benefits.

<a NAME="REVIEW"><h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3></a>
<p><b><a NAME="REVIEWCRIT">A. NSF Proposal Review Process</a></b></p>
<p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education project.  These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process.  NSF invites the proposer to suggest, at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate reviewers.  Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.  Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>

<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below.  The criteria include considerations that help define them.  These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal.  While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which he/she is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<ul>
<b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br>
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields?  How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project?  (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.)  To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?  Is there sufficient access to resources?
</ul>
<ul><b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br>
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning?  How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)?  To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?  Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
</ul>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions: </p>
<ul><i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br>
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.
</ul>
<ul><i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br>
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

<B>Additional Review Criteria</B><BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">In addition to the above criteria, other factors will be considered in the evaluation process.  Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the degree to which proposals have successfully addressed the points outlined in the Proposal Preparation Instructions (Section V.A), in particular:</P><P><ul><li> Appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed activities for the participants and institutions involved, including evidence for substantive involvement of research scientists in all phases of the project;<BR><li> Ability of the project to bring science of the MPS disciplines to the public, including the potential for long-term sustainability of the partnership among participating institutions;<BR><li> Effectiveness of the plan for evaluation and assessment; <BR><li> Additional criteria for large projects: breadth of impact on the public; effectiveness of plan for dissemination; potential for serving as a model;  and plan for project management.</ul></P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></FONT>
</ul>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the identities of reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.  In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p><b><a NAME="REVIEWPROT">B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</a></b></p>
<p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the proposal.
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation will be reviewed by Mail and/or Panel Review.</FONT>
</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal.  The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>

<p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months.  The time interval begins on the closing date of an announcement/solicitation or the date of proposal receipt (whichever is later).   The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.
</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement.  Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer.  A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at one's own risk.

<h3><a NAME="AWARDADMIN">VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</a></h3>
<h4>A.  <a NAME="AWARDNOTIFY">Notification of the Award</a></h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements.  Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator.  (See section VI.A. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<h4>B.  <a NAME="GRANTCOND">Award Conditions</a></h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1)* or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions;* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter.  Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1).  Electronic mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification from the Division of Grants and Agreements.</p>

<p><a NAME="REPORTREQ"><b>C. Reporting Requirements</b></a></p>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period.
</p>

<p>
Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.  Approximately 30 days before expiration, NSF will send a notice to remind the PI of the requirement to file the final project report.  Failure to provide final technical reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for that PI.  PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.
</p>
<p>NSF has implemented an electronic project reporting system, available through FastLane.  This system permits electronic submission and updating of project reports, including information on project participants (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications, and other specific products and contributions.   PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>
