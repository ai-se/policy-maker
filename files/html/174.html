        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Antarctic Earth Science Program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Polar Programs provides support for the curation and long-term storage of core material collected on the Antarctic continent and its margins. Currently, the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University is fulfilling this role. The AMGRF was established in 1963 and is housed in a single-story, 10,000 sq. ft. building on the Florida State University campus.   This facility consists of a 6000 sq. ft. cold room (34 &deg;F), a walk-in freezer (-27 &deg;F) and office and lab space. AMGRF houses approximately 21,400 meters of marine sediment and drill cores collected from over 90 United States Antarctic Program (USAP) research cruises.  Approximately 5,300 meters of core are stored in core boxes, 6,000 meters of piston cores are stored in plastic sleeves in sections up to 3.5 meters long, 600 meters of core are stored in various other containers, and approximately 10,500 meters are stored in D-tubes. Less than 100 meters of core is stored at -20&deg; F.  In addition the AMGRF has an estimated 5000 bags of samples from grab samples and core catchers.</p>
            <p>Florida State University has been an effective steward of these marine cores for many years but the University has recently notified NSF that continued operation of the AMGRF is no longer central to the long term vision of the University. Consequently, this solicitation seeks a qualified organization to provide core curation services for geological cores collected in the polar regions. The award will be administered as a Cooperative Agreement and will cover a five-year operating period beginning October 1, 2017.  A programmatic review will be held prior to the completion of the initial period of support and the results will guide the decision whether to renew the Cooperative Agreement for another five-year period.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The Antarctic Instrumentation, Facilities, and Special Projects and Earth Science Programs in the Antarctic Sciences Section of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Polar Programs provides support for the curation and long-term storage of core material collected on the Antarctic continent and its margins, and other Polar regions. This national collection of geologic materials is an important resource for scientific research on earth history, ice sheet development, and climate variability on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean. In addition, the cores and the data collected from these cores, are important resources for training the next generation of scientists.</p>
          <p>A recent comprehensive review of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) stressed the importance of geological sampling to answer fundamental questions about paleoclimate, global change, past and current ice sheet dynamics, and for understanding earth history. The results of this review are described two reports: a 2011 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report titled &ldquo;Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean&rdquo; and the USAP Blue Ribbon Panel report &ldquo;More and Better Science in Antarctica Through Increased Logistical Effectiveness.&rdquo; A second NAS report released in August 2015 also recommended research priorities that encompass a continued need for geological core materials, to advance scientific understanding of past environmental change in Antarctica and the Southern Oceans. Consequently, there continues to be an important scientific rationale to maintain current cores that are still viable for research and to accommodate acquisition of new core material in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Currently, the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University is providing core storage and curatorial services for the Antarctic sediment core collection. The AMGRF was established in 1963 and is housed in a single-story, 10,000 sq. ft. building on the Florida State University campus. The facility consists of a 6000 sq. ft. cold room (34 &deg;F), a walk-in freezer (-27 &deg;F), as well as office and lab space.  The AMGRF houses approximately 21,400 meters of marine sediment and drill cores collected from over 90 United States Antarctic Program (USAP) research
           cruises.  Approximately 5,300 m of core are stored in core boxes, 6,000 m of piston cores are stored in plastic sleeves in sections up to 3.5 m long, 600 m of core are stored in various other containers, and approximately 10,500 m are stored in D-tubes. Less than 100 m of core are stored in the walk-in freezer and all of the frozen core will fit in the two portable freezers that will transition with the facility. In addition the AMGRF has an estimated 5000 bags of samples from grab samples and core catchers. Geological drilling projects whose cores are curated at the AMGRF include the Dry Valleys Drilling Project, Cape Roberts Project, SHALDRIL 1 and 2, and ANDRILL 1 and 2.</p>
          <p>The number of visitors to the AMGRF has varied between 10-15 on an annual basis. The number of cores received annually is variable depending on the number of field projects supported during the Antarctic field season. Between 2009-2015 approximately 420 m of core were contributed to the facility and 19,220 individual samples were requested from the collection (2,955 foreign and 16,265 domestic).  Equipment that is expected to travel with the core to the new facility includes: Geotek core splitter; Geotek MSCL-XYZ, 5-track with MS, color spectrophotometer and XRF; Core racks with casters for D-tubes; 2-upright -20F freezers; freeze dryer; 2 CX-31P petrographic microscopes with one camera SC30; MXRI X-Ray; Malvern 2000 Particle Size Analyzer; Olympus BX51 microscope with camera DP25; Multisensor Split Core Logging, Geotek MSCL single track with MS, gamma density and resistivity; Mobile Shelving Space Saver; Laboratory Mobile Storage.  </p>
          <p>Florida State University has been an effective steward of these marine cores for many years but the University has recently notified NSF that continued operation of the AMGRF is no longer central to the long term vision of the University. Consequently, this solicitation seeks a qualified organization to provide core curation services for geological cores collected in the polar regions. The award will be administered as a Cooperative Agreement and will cover a five- year operating period beginning October 1, 2017. A programmatic review will be held prior to the completion of the initial period of support and the results will guide the decision whether to renew the Cooperative Agreement for another five-year period.</p>
          <p> The Antarctic Sciences Section strongly encourages proposals from persons under-represented in science (e.g. women, minorities, those with disabilities) and from investigators new to Antarctic research with the goal of broadening participation of both individuals and institutions. Antarctic Sciences also strongly encourages international collaborations and research-related education and outreach as part of broader impacts of proposals.</p>

        <h3> 
          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>NSF's Antarctic Sciences Section intends to support efficient and cost effective core curation services for the U.S. Polar community. Work will be supported over the life of the award in accordance with the prospective Cooperative Agreement.  The awardee will submit interim reports summarizing curatorial activities, with the last quarterly report in Years 1-4 being a roll-up of that year's activities, which then serves as the annual project report.  In Year 5 of the award, the last quarterly report also will be a roll-up of that year's activities, which then serves as the final project report.  The awardee will also participate in external program reviews by panels of experts convened by NSF who will review Awardee performance under the Cooperative Agreement.</p>
          <p>The successful awardee will provide the services and support needed to curate the Antarctic marine geology core collection according to standard practices employed by other core repositories serving U.S. researchers. Proposals should clearly demonstrate that sufficient, climate controlled core storage is available to securely house the collection. In addition, the proposal should describe the staffing level required to provide core curation services to the research community. Proposals should also describe how the awardee would make the research community aware of core materials available for research and education. The awardee is expected to be an active member of the Antarctic and Arctic Data Consortium and must help facilitate activities of this group (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.a2dc.org/">http://www.a2dc.org/</a>). The awardee will also be required to establish a curatorial advisory committee and the proposal should discuss the proposed expertise of committee members as well as the committee structure and its expected responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Principal tasks for the curatorial activities are given below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Core Curation and Technical Services - Provide curation services for existing collections including sampling of cores to fill community requests, receipt and processing of new cores, development of core descriptions to be published on the awardee&rsquo;s website and hosting grantees or scientists in processing of cores.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Stewardship of the core collection including activities to maintain awareness of the scientific viability of holdings and to inform periodic decisions about de-accessioning of material.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Facility Website - The Awardee will provide a website that acts as a "gateway" to the holdings and curatorial services with links to other relevant Antarctic support entities and resources. The website will fully comply with federal and NSF guidelines. &#8232;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Core and Sample Database - The awardee must maintain a core and sample database that can be accessed through the curatorial activity website. The database must be searchable with basic information about the cores as well as information about samples previously removed from the cores. &#8232;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Research Capabilities - Basic core characterization capabilities must be provided to enable researchers to develop data sets of basic physical properties from the cores in the collection. The proposal must demonstrate that the awardee will be proactive in meeting future community requirements for curatorial improvements and enhanced curatorial capabilities. </p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
     
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
         <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
   
        <p><strong>Review criteria will also include the following, assigned to the Key Features described in Section II Program Description as noted below: </strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Assessment of the proposed organizational structure, competence, and overall ability to provide service and support to the research community (Key Features #1 and #2). &#8232;</li>
          <li>Thoroughness of the proposal in addressing the relevant elements of programmatic management and facilities requirements (Key Features #1, #2, #3, and #4). &#8232;</li>
          <li>Effectiveness of the proposal in conveying an understanding of the required effort and the approach used to achieve an appropriate balance of resource allocation (Key Features #3 and #4).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p> Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Site Visit Review.</p>
     
    
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>In accordance with the Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR), the awardee will submit interim reports summarizing curatorial activities, with the last quarterly report in Years 1-4 being a roll-up of that year's activities, which then serves as the annual project report.  In Year 5 of the award, the last quarterly report also will be a roll-up of that year's activities, which then serves as the final project report. </p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
