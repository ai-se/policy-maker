<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div><p>Section 3(e) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Act of 1950, as amended, states that: &quot;...it shall be an objective of the Foundation to strengthen research and education in the sciences and engineering, including independent research by individuals, throughout the United States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.&quot; Through its Congressional mandate, NSF promotes and advances scientific progress nationwide. In 1978, public concern about undue geographical concentration of federal funding of academic research and development (R&amp;D) led Congress to further authorize NSF to conduct the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). These Congressional instructions, which established the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, have been restated in subsequent Congressional authorizations of the Foundation&rsquo;s budget. Eligibility for EPSCoR participation is restricted to those jurisdictions that have historically received lesser amounts of NSF R&amp;D funding and have demonstrated a commitment to develop their research bases and to improve the quality of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research conducted at their universities and colleges. Twenty-nine jurisdictions including twenty-seven states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands currently participate in one or more elements of the NSF EPSCoR program. (See section I, paragraph D, for additional EPSCoR <em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligibility_table_fy2011.pdf">eligibility information</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>A. EPSCoR Mission and Goals</strong></p>
<p>The mission of EPSCoR is to assist the National Science Foundation in its statutory function</p>
<p>&quot;to strengthen research and education in science and engineering throughout the United States and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.&quot;</p>
<p>EPSCoR goals are to:</p><ul>
<li>provide strategic programs and opportunities for EPSCoR participants that stimulate sustainable improvements in their R&amp;D capacity and competitiveness, and</li>
<li>advance science and engineering capabilities in EPSCoR jurisdictions for discovery, innovation, and overall knowledge-based prosperity.</li>
</ul><p><strong>B. EPSCoR Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of EPSCoR is to stimulate research that is fully competitive in the disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs of the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>Specific EPSCoR objectives are to:</p><ul>
<li>catalyze key research themes that empower knowledge generation, dissemination, and application;</li>
<li>activate effective jurisdictional and regional collaborations that advance scientific research, promote innovation, and benefit society;</li>
<li>broaden participation in science and engineering (S&amp;E) by institutions, organizations, and people within EPSCoR jurisdictions; and</li>
<li>use EPSCoR for development, implementation, and evaluation of future programmatic experiments that motivate positive change and progression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pursuit of these goals and objectives bolsters the capacity of jurisdictions to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance discovery and learning through utilization of cyberinfrastructure and other evolving technologies;</li>
<li>develop the diverse, well-prepared, internationally competent and globally engaged STEM workforce necessary to sustain the nation&rsquo;s competitive edge;</li>
<li>facilitate knowledge generation leading to economic development; and</li>
<li>expand the scientific literacy of all citizens, and disseminate to them the importance of STEM research and education.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. EPSCoR Investment Strategies</strong></p>
<p>EPSCoR&rsquo;s investment portfolio is aligned with the Foundation&rsquo;s strategic outcome goals of DISCOVERY, LEARNING, RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE, and STEWARDSHIP:</p><ul>
<li>Discovery - Foster research that will advance the frontiers of knowledge, emphasizing areas of greatest opportunity and potential benefit, and establishing the nation as a global leader in fundamental and transformational science and engineering.</li>
<li>Learning - Cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.</li>
<li>Research Infrastructure - Build the nation&rsquo;s research capability through critical investments in advanced instrumentation, facilities, cyberinfrastructure, and experimental tools.</li>
<li>Stewardship - Support excellence in science and engineering research and education through a capable and responsive organization.</li>
</ul><p>EPSCoR uses three major investment strategies to achieve its goal of improving the R&amp;D competitiveness of researchers and institutions within EPSCoR jurisdictions. These strategies are Research Infrastructure Improvement Program awards, Co-Funding of disciplinary and multidisciplinary research, and Outreach and Workshops.</p><ul>
<li>Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Track-1 (RII Track-1), Track-2 (RII Track-2), and Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Cyber Connectivity (RII C2) Awards. <ul>
<li>RII Track-1 awards provide up to $4 million per year for up to five years. They are intended to improve the research competitiveness of jurisdictions by improving their academic research infrastructure in areas of science and engineering supported by the National Science Foundation and critical to the particular jurisdiction&rsquo;s science and technology initiative or plan. These areas must be identified by the jurisdiction&rsquo;s EPSCoR governing committee as having the best potential to improve the jurisdiction&rsquo;s future R&amp;D competitiveness.</li>
<li>RII Track-2 awards provide up to $2 million per year for up to three years as collaborative awards to consortia of EPSCoR jurisdictions to support innovation-enabling cyberinfrastructure of regional, thematic, or technological importance. These awards facilitate the enhancement of discovery, learning, and economic development of EPSCoR jurisdictions through the use of cyberinfrastructure and other technologies.</li>
<li>RII C2 awards provide up to $1 million for up to 2 years to support the enhancement of inter-campus and intra-campus cyber connectivity within an EPSCoR jurisdiction. These awards are intended to enhance broadband access for academic research and for utilization of cyberinfrastructure consistent with the jurisdiction&rsquo;s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) plan. The inter-campus and intra-campus connectivity targeted by these awards is expected to broaden individual and institutional participation in STEM research and education activities within and among jurisdictions and to facilitate synergy among NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Co-Funding of Disciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research.EPSCoR co-invests with NSF Directorates and Offices in the support of meritorious proposals from individual investigators, groups, and centers in EPSCoR jurisdictions that are submitted to the Foundation&rsquo;s research and education programs, and crosscutting initiatives. These proposals have been merit reviewed and recommended for award, but could not be funded without the combined, leveraged support of EPSCoR and the Research and Education Directorates.Co-funding leverages EPSCoR investment and facilitates participation of EPSCoR scientists and engineers in Foundation-wide programs and initiatives.</li>
<li>Outreach and Workshops. The EPSCoR Office considers requests for support of workshops, conferences, and other community-based activities designed to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering, and to share best practices in design and implementation in strategic planning, diversity, communication, cyberinfrastructure, evaluation, and other areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions (See NSF 06-613). The EPSCoR Office also supports outreach travel that enables NSF staff from all Directorates and Offices to work with the EPSCoR research community regarding NSF opportunities, priorities, programs, and policies. Such travel also serves to more fully acquaint NSF staff with the science and engineering accomplishments, ongoing activities, and new directions and opportunities in research and education in the jurisdictions.</li>
</ul><p><strong>D. Criteria for Eligibility to Participate in the Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Cyber Connectivity (RII C2)</strong></p>
<p>Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Cyber Connectivity and other EPSCoR program <em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligibility_table_fy2011.pdf">eligibility</a></em> is based on two primary considerations:</p><ul>
<li>A jurisdiction&rsquo;s demonstrated commitment to develop its research bases and to improve the quality of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research conducted at its universities and colleges, and</li>
<li>A jurisdiction&rsquo;s most recent three-year history of research funds awarded by NSF relative to the Foundation&rsquo;s total research budget for that same period.</li>
</ul><p>Regarding the second consideration, a jurisdiction is eligible to participate in EPSCoR programs if its level of research support is equal to or less than 0.75 percent of the total NSF research budget for that same period. Adjustments are made in the rare instances where a single large NSF-funded national or international facility skews the data. The NSF EPSCoR website lists these summary data and the <em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligibility_table_fy2011.pdf">eligibility criteria</a></em>. Twenty-seven states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands are currently eligible to participate in NSF EPSCoR programs.</p>
<p>A newly eligible jurisdiction must submit a successful planning grant proposal before Research Infrastructure Improvement proposals (RII Track-1, RII Track-2, or RII C2) can be submitted. A &quot;new&quot; EPSCoR-eligible jurisdiction is defined as a State, US Territory, or US Commonwealth that (1)previously did not qualify via the established 0.75 percent criterion, but is declared eligible under the most recent publication of the annual NSF EPSCoR eligibility list (<em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligibility_table_fy2011.pdf">eligibility criteria</a></em>) and (2) has demonstrated commitment to developing their research bases. Planning grant proposals can be submitted at any time following the most recent declaration of eligibility. In order to compete for an RII Track-1, RII Track-2, and RII C2 award, the &quot;new&quot; jurisdiction must have received an EPSCoR planning grant.</p>
<p>Eligible jurisdictions may seek such planning support to formulate a documented vision and implementation design for their research, education, and innovation strategies. An expected outcome from any supported planning activity is the submission of a competitive RII Track-1, RII Track-2, or RII C2 proposal and subsequent proposals to NSF Directorates and Offices, which combine capacity-building with capability enhancement for addressing bold opportunities characterized by regional relevance and national importance.</p>
<p>A jurisdiction wishing to submit a planning grant proposal must notify the NSF EPSCoR Office with a letter of intent to submit and then meet with NSF EPSCoR officials to discuss the conceptual project, potential partners and estimated cost. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, the jurisdiction may be invited to submit an EPSCoR planning proposal,in accordance with NSF&rsquo;s grant proposal guidelines.</p>

<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div><p><strong>RII C2 Program Description</strong></p>
<p>Broadband connectivity within and among campuses can advance jurisdictional progress toward broader research and educational engagement at the frontiers of discovery and innovation in science and engineering. Execution of well-articulated plans for the development, deployment, and improvement of broadband connectivity will foster collaboration, prompt innovation, broaden individual and institutional participation, strengthen e-learning, create jobs, develop the workforce, contribute to the economic development of jurisdictions, and help to facilitate participation in the computing based intellectual future.</p>
<p>Combined jurisdictional and EPSCoR investments have facilitated the development of cutting edge cyberinfrastructure in many of the jurisdictions&rsquo; research intensive institutions. In these and other institutions within the jurisdictions, however,there remain significant gaps in cyber connectivity and broadband access. This is particularly true of less research intensive institutions, especially minority serving, two-year, four-year, and rural ones. RII C2 provides a unique opportunity for jurisdictions to address such issues and to provide community colleges and minority serving institutions with advanced connections to research and research-based education that will accelerate learning, discovery, and economic development in rural and underserved communities.</p>
<p>The primary drivers for RII C2 investments are broadband connectivity needs within and among academic campuses. World class science and engineering research, modern cyberinfrastructure, and innovative education in STEM disciplines that can be facilitated by enhanced broadband cyber connectivity are also important motivating elements. Such investments will facilitate discovery and innovation, and enable the development of a science and engineering workforce appropriate to the future of the jurisdiction and the nation. <strong>Proposals should include an explicit description of research, education, diversity, workforce development, and external engagement enabled by the RII C2 investment.</strong> RII C2 investments are expected to result in measurable increases and broader engagement in individual and institutional diversity within the jurisdiction. It is also expected that the ability to successfully pursue significant opportunities in science and engineering research, education, and workforce development will be enhanced by the RII C2 investment. The RII C2 award is expected to add specific value to the jurisdiction&rsquo;s academic cyber and research infrastructure not generally available through other funding.</p>
<p>As in other Research Infrastructure Improvement activities (RII Track-1 and RII Track-2), each jurisdiction must utilize its EPSCoR governing committee, which works closely with leaders in academe, government, and the private sector. The committee will identify potential cyber connectivity improvement strategies that are consistent with the jurisdiction&rsquo;s S&amp;T plan and the associated cyberinfrastructure, diversity, and workforce development plans which, together with current RII Track-1, RII Track-2, and other RII related activities, are most likely to advance the development of a nationally competitive cyber-enabled academic R&amp;D capability.</p>
<p>In preparation for submitting an RII C2 proposal, the EPSCoR governing committee is expected to have undertaken a thorough assessment of the current state of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s cyber connectivity. Also, the jurisdiction should identify strengths, barriers, and opportunities for further development of comprehensive inter-campus and intra-campus cyber connectivity and broadband access in support of overall objectives in research, education, and innovation. The RII C2 proposal must describe the strategy and implementation mechanisms for the development, expansion, utilization, and long-term sustainability of the targeted cyber connectivity and broadband access capabilities. Use of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; diagrams to depict and explain the proposed connectivity is required. Successful inter-campus and intra-campus cyber connectivity improvement plans are likely to be those that provide sound platforms and opportunities for broad institutional engagement in research and research-based education that utilize the diverse human, physical, and technological resources of the jurisdiction, and contribute to its economic development. The proposal must provide a strong quantitative justification showing the current status and future scientific need for the increased networking capacity and impact. Connectivity across the jurisdictions and as external engagement should be addressed.</p>
<p>To ensure maximum impact of limited EPSCoR resources, the proposed project must:</p><ul>
<li>Add significantly and measurably to its research and education capability in S&amp;T areas of high institutional and jurisdictional priority;</li>
<li>Engage the full diversity of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s resources in the STEM enterprise;</li>
<li>Contribute to the jurisdiction&rsquo;s strategy for future research and innovation; and</li>
<li>Present a detailed strategy to generate subsequent, sustained non-EPSCoR funding from federal, jurisdictional, or private sector sources.</li>
</ul><p><strong>N.B.: In all instances, clear specification of goals, performance milestones, and a timetable for achieving such milestones is a requirement for EPSCoR support.</strong></p>
<p>A RII C2 award is not the appropriate mechanism to provide support for individual faculty research projects. Requests for support of such projects should be directed to NSF&rsquo;s research grant programs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Eligible Activities</strong></p>
<p>Proposals requesting funds for cyber connectivity improvement may include support for academic, jurisdictional, for-profit and non-profit organizations, as well as eligible individuals employed by such organizations both within and outside the jurisdiction. In addition, cooperative programs among research universities, predominantly undergraduate institutions, especially minority serving rural 2-year institutions, are eligible for EPSCoR support. In all cases, however, Project Directors/Principal Investigators of proposed EPSCoR projects must be affiliated with research universities, agencies, or organizations within the participant jurisdiction. Whereas the proposed project may employ collaborations between EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR participants, EPSCoR funding can only be requested and used for the EPSCoR-based components. In addition, all activities carried out under an EPSCoR award are subject to the restrictions concerning eligible science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines and activities detailed in the NSF Proposal and Award Policy and Procedures (PAPP) Guide found on the NSF website at https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/papp/index.jsp.</p>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer&rsquo;s discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><h4>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a><p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br/>How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br/>How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br/>One of the principal strategies in support of NSF&rsquo;s goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</blockquote>
<blockquote><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br/>Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Review Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers for the RII Cyber Connectivity competition will also consider the following specific aspects of intellectual merit and broader impacts:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1. Strategic Fidelity and Impact</strong>. How well are the proposed cyber connectivity enhancements and the education, diversity, workforce development, and sustainability plans aligned with central research themes? Is there sufficient alignment with other RII C2 investments in the jurisdictions? How is the project likely to have the proposed impacts on the research and education capability and capacity of the jurisdiction? How does each proposed component contribute to improved competitiveness in research, education, and innovation?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>2. Value Added</strong>. How do the proposed activities add value at the institutional, jurisdictional and regional levels in research, education, and economic development? How will the additional value be measured? What quantitative measurements show the current need for the proposed upgrade? What quantitative measurements show how the upgrade will impact research? How does the project advance the jurisdiction&rsquo;s innovation and economic development plans through greater emphasis on connections and linkages within and among academic campuses and private and public sectors? How will the proposed project result in increased diversity in the jurisdiction&rsquo;s workforce?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>3. RII C2-enabled Research and Education</strong>. How well are the proposed cyber connectivity enhancements aligned with the needs and priorities of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s research infrastructure improvements, education, workforce development, external engagement and economic development plans? How is the project likely to have a meaningful impact on research and education capacity and capability in the jurisdiction, especially in rural and underserved areas? How will the proposed strategies, programs, and projects advance the jurisdiction&rsquo;s innovation and economic development? Do they give rise to greater emphasis on creativity, inventiveness, technology transfer, potential commercialization, and national R&amp;D competitiveness?</p><p>How well are the proposed cyber connectivity plans coordinated with existing and/or unfolding cyberinfrastructure plans and strategies of the jurisdiction? How will the proposed activities be integrated and coordinated with the existing and/or planned RII Track-1, RII Track-2, or other RII relevant activities and programs? In particular, how will the proposed broadband access complement and enhance the cyber-related programs and activities already in place? Is there a clear, comprehensive plan for cyber connectivity and broadband access between and among campuses in support of overall objectives in research, education, innovation and economic development? How well articulated are the roles of cyber connectivity and broadband access in the diversity and workforce development plans of the jurisdiction? How do these roles facilitate attainment of the goals of those plans?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>4. Diversity.</strong> How clearly expressed is the current state of diversity within the jurisdiction? How well conceived and articulated are the plans to more broadly engage the jurisdiction&rsquo;s human and institutional resources in pursuit of the cyber enabled research and education goals? Is there a clearly defined and accurate resourced path to increased broadband access at 2-year, 4-year, rural, and minority serving institutions?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>5. Workforce Development</strong>. How will RII C2 activities contribute to the development of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s STEM workforce? How well does the plan create experiences that prepare tomorrow&rsquo;s workforce to design, deploy, and use cyber based technologies? Are the plan activities likely to accelerate the pace of positive change leading to creation of new jobs and increased economic prosperity? How does the workforce development plan build upon and utilize existing state and regional networks that already afford various levels of connectivity to universities, 2- and 4-year colleges, K-12 schools, and libraries?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>6. External Engagement</strong>. How well is external engagement integrated into the various elements of the RII C2 project? How does external engagement spark new forms of collaboration and social interaction such as e-learning or e-science? How effectively does external engagement contribute to the efficient sharing of data and information among and beyond project partners? Is there a coordinated process for the collection and dissemination of major results to various audiences, e.g., scientific and educational communities, other EPSCoR jurisdictions, the general public, and the NSF?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>7. Evaluation and Assessment</strong>. How effective is the proposed plan likely to be in measuring the outputs and outcomes of the RII C2 project? How clear and appropriate are the proposed metrics and criteria for assessing project accomplishments according to a well defined schedule? How clearly defined are processes for reliably capturing and analyzing metric-related data and reporting it in a timely manner? Are the appropriate formative and summative evaluation plans for assessing status, major impacts, and future directions described? How adequately resourced are the evaluation and assessment tasks? Are the independent, external evaluators appropriate?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>8. Sustainability.</strong> How clear, reasonable, and viable are the plans for sustainability? How does the plan address sustainability of human, physical, and cyber infrastructure? How will the project team contribute to the sustainability of a more competitive research and education enterprise driven by cyber-based discovery and innovation?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>9. Management Plan</strong>. How clearly structured and likely to be effective is the management plan? Do the Project Director and the management team demonstrate the vision, experience and capacity to lead the RII C2 project? Do the Project Director and management team have knowledge of and connections with appropriate national academic research networks? Are the membership and roles of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s EPSCoR governing committee and external advisors plainly identified, and is their involvement in the project clear, well defined, and free of conflicts of interest? Are plans for technical assistance appropriate and are the anticipated providers of such assistance appropriately qualified?</p></blockquote>
<a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>
<h4>B. Review and Selection Process</h4><p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal&rsquo;s review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4><p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>

Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes reportwill delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF&rsquo;s electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
