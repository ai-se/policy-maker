Announcement #01-04</font></font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Connection Problems to FastLane and other NSF Sites</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">NSF has taken many steps to ensure
the reliability of the FastLane servers.&nbsp; Since implementing hardware
and software changes to FastLane late last year, the system has been operating
nearly continuously without the slowness and server problems frequently
experienced in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, reliable software and servers
are unimportant if users cannot connect to FastLane.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Users of NSF's main web sites experienced
access problems from Thursday, May 17, through the morning of Monday, May
21.&nbsp; The problems originated with the failure of the cable connecting
Verizon with NSF's primary Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; This
was followed by a firewall configuration problem at NSF.&nbsp; Both problems
were corrected by 9:00 AM (EDT) this morning (5/21).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Due to the problems encountered,
the deadlines for Teacher Enhancement preliminary proposals (NSF 01-60)
and Technology for a Sustainable Environment (NSF 01-76) have been extended
to Tuesday, May 22, 5:00 P.M. local time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadline for
HPNC proposals (NSF 01-73) has been extended to Friday, May 25, 5:00 P.M.
local time.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
