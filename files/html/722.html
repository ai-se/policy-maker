<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This program provides awards to enhance the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as a means to broaden participation in the Nation's STEM workforce. Support is available for Implementation Projects, Planning Grants, Education Research Projects, and Targeted Infusion Projects.  </p>
  <p><strong>Implementation Projects</strong> provide support to implement a comprehensive institutional project to strengthen STEM education and research. Proposed activities and strategies should: be the result of an institutional STEM self-analysis; address institutional and NSF goals; and have the potential to result in significant and sustainable improvements in STEM program offerings. Typical project implementation strategies include: curriculum enhancement, faculty professional development, undergraduate research, academic enrichment, student support services, infusion of technology to enhance STEM instruction, collaborations with research institutions and industry, and other activities that enhance the quality of the undergraduate STEM education program.&nbsp; Proposers are encouraged to analyze the strengths of the institution and design innovative educational strategies, based on proven best practices, to place the institution at the forefront of undergraduate STEM education.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Grants</strong> provide support to undertake self-analysis of the institution's undergraduate STEM programs to identify components that need improvement or enhancement in order to provide a high quality undergraduate STEM education.&nbsp; Planning grants should also research existing activities and strategies that could be implemented to improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education at the institution.&nbsp; Typical activities include: data collection and analysis, stakeholder consultation, research of potential activities and strategies, site visits to model programs, and writing an Implementation Project proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Education Research Projects</strong> provide support to undertake a three-year education research project that has the potential to strengthen the STEM education and research programs at HBCUs. Education Research Projects must be based on sound education research methodologies and theories.&nbsp; Potential education research topics include: retention, diffusion of innovations, curricula enhancements, technology in education, STEM teacher education, and the identification of successful models.&nbsp; This is not a supplemental program - HBCUs do not need to have an Implementation Project in order to submit ERP proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Infusion Projects</strong> provide support to achieve a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education.&nbsp; Typically, projects are focused on one activity within a single STEM department however interdisciplinary and cross disciplinary projects are encouraged. Potential goals include: specialized accreditation or certifications, establishing new programs or concentrations, establishing collaborations between STEM disciplines and teacher education programs, and updating programs to reflect advances in the field and workforce requirements.&nbsp; This is not a supplemental program - HBCUs do not need to have an Implementation Project in order to submit a TIP proposal.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research at HBCUs.&nbsp; HBCU-UP recognizes and supports the important role that HBCUs play in increasing the numbers of underrepresented ethnic minorities that are well prepared for participation and leadership at every level of education and research in STEM.</p>
<p>HBCU-UP is one of the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s programs designed to &quot;Cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the science literacy of all citizens.&quot; (NSF Strategic Plan 2006-2011). HBCU-UP is managed by the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD), located in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, HBCU-UP will support awards for Implementation Projects, Planning Grants, Education Research Projects, and Targeted Infusion Projects.</p>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong> IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS</strong>: Five-year, institution-wide, undergraduate STEM education and research capacity building projects.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>NSF expects that the activities and strategies included in Implementation
    Project proposals will be designed specifically to address the HBCU&rsquo;s institutional STEM needs, long-term goals, and mission. Therefore NSF allows maximum flexibility in the design of Implementation Projects under HBCU-UP. The activities should be designed to produce significant improvements in undergraduate STEM education and research programs that have the potential to become sustainable by the end of the five year project.&nbsp; HBCUs
    that do not have STEM research activities can submit proposals focusing on
    enhancing the quality of their STEM education programs and/or establishing
    new undergraduate STEM degree programs.</p>
  <p>Projects that propose to develop and implement innovative, non-traditional,
    models for undergraduate education are highly encouraged.&nbsp; For example, some HBCUs may be well positioned to establish novel interdisciplinary degree programs and to implement alternative models to the typical&nbsp;departmental structure of STEM programs.&nbsp; Other innovative models might incorporate interactive discovery based experiences for freshman and sophomore students, and use cyberinfrastructure resources to enhance STEM education curriculum.&nbsp; Creative
    undergraduate education models designed for HBCUs with small undergraduate
    STEM major enrollment and small numbers of STEM faculty are particularly
    encouraged.</p>
  <p>Institutions that have not already identified activities and strategies for an Implementation Project are encouraged to consider applying for a Planning Grant to perform an institutional STEM program self-analysis before submitting an Implementation Project proposal.</p>
  <p>If an institution has previously received an HBCU-UP Implementation Project grant, it is critical that the proposal for a second Implementation project provide complete information on the outcomes of that HBCU-UP project. Including a description of how successful activities are being sustained by the institution and what was learned from the previous activities. <em>Second</em> <em>HBCU-UP awards must not simply continue previous HBCU-UP activities.</em> The activities in the new proposal should be based on a thorough evaluation of the previous HBCU-UP project and move the institution to the next level of STEM program quality.</p>
  <p>Competitive HBCU-UP implementation proposals will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support <strong>new</strong> STEM activities or enhancements - not support
      existing activities.</li>
        <li>Coordinate all institutional STEM strengthening activities (new and existing)
          in order to create a <strong>comprehensive STEM program</strong> that will
          result in <strong>significant and sustainable</strong> improvements.</li>
        <li>Raise the <strong>quality</strong> of STEM education and student learning,
          including increasing opportunities for high quality&nbsp; research experiences
          for students and faculty.</li>
        <li><strong>Establish and develop partnerships</strong> with other minority-serving
          institutions, other institutions of higher education, other NSF projects
          such as the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program
          (IGERT), Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
          and Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), industrial
          laboratories, national laboratories, and other research centers to enhance
          and support HBCU-UP activities.</li>
      </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Project Scope:</strong></em> The scope will depend on the size
    and number of STEM programs and the complexity of the current and proposed
    project activities - ideally all STEM programs and STEM students and faculty
    would be affected by the HBCU-UP activities. The scope of the project should
    be clearly defined numerically, outlining the impact on students and faculty
    of the proposed HBCU-UP activities. If the proposed scope will be limited
    the reasons should be clearly outlined.&nbsp; Please note that the social,
    behavioral and economic sciences are eligible to be included in an Implementation
    Project proposal.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Activities may include, but are not limited to:</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Course and curriculum development, revision, and enhancement:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integrate student research and interactive discovery based experiences
      into the STEM curriculum</li>
        <li>Integrate technology and cyberinfrastructure resources into STEM curricula
          and instruction</li>
        <li>Revise STEM gate-keeping and bottleneck courses</li>
        <li>Develop, adapt, and/or implement new instructional materials</li>
        <li>Develop and introduce new STEM program offerings</li>
        <li>Incorporate advances in science and engineering knowledge into courses
          and laboratories</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Coordinate and support research opportunities for undergraduate students
      on-campus or off-site including international research opportunities</li>
        <li>Coordinate and support internships or cooperative education opportunities</li>
        <li>Provide undergraduate STEM scholarships and awards (note that HBCU-UP
          projects should not primarily be scholarship programs since sustainability
          of such a project is questionable)</li>
        <li>Develop and enhance tutoring services and mentoring programs</li>
        <li>Enhance student access to computer labs and STEM scientific equipment</li>
        <li>Provide travel for students for professional development</li>
        <li>Develop and enhance advising, counseling, and career services</li>
        <li>Address critical transition points such as the transition between high
          school and college, between two- and four-year colleges, from undergraduate
          to graduate studies, and from college to the workplace</li>
        <li>Develop links with other NSF funded projects such as IGERT, AGEP, CREST
          to facilitate undergraduate student research and graduate school transition</li>
        <li>Provide graduate school planning and preparation &ndash; test taking
          courses, application preparation, curriculum vitae development, funding
          opportunities and financial aid information</li>
      </ul>
  <p><strong><em>NOTES:</em></strong> <em>Student financial support may only be provided to students who are United States citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. Graduate student research is not supported under the HBCU-UP program.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Faculty professional development:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop and enhance professional development opportunities - pedagogy

  <p>Education Research Project proposals should be designed to add to the knowledge
    base of STEM education in the HBCU context.&nbsp; We also encourage Education Research Project proposals that can serve as a basis for strengthening undergraduate STEM programs in higher education. &nbsp;Education research proposals that study past or ongoing HBCU-UP Implementation Projects and other NSF projects are strongly encouraged.&nbsp; The
    scope of a proposed education research project may be limited to one institution
    or program or include several institutions or programs.</p>
  <p>Do not submit proposals to Education Research Project to implement intervention
    activities.&nbsp; These activities can be included in HBCU-UP Implementation
    Projects or other education programs within NSF (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/</a>).&nbsp; Proposals
    submitted as Education Research Project proposals that are not clearly education
    research projects will be returned without review.</p>
  <p>Education Research Project proposals must include PIs with expertise in
    education research and/or social science research methods in addition to
    PIs with knowledge about STEM programs at HBCUs.&nbsp; Proposers are encouraged
    to establish collaborations to strengthen the education research proposal.
    The proposal should describe the nature of the collaboration and the anticipated
    effects of the collaboration. The proposal should include letters of support
    from collaborators which outline the role and value of the collaboration.</p>
  <p>Proposals should discuss how the work would contribute to productive public
    or scholarly debate. As appropriate, proposals should describe mechanisms
    to effectively and efficiently transfer findings into educational practice. &nbsp;Proposals
    that focus on the potential utility of research and evaluation findings and
    their transfer into practice or use by other researchers and policymakers
    are encouraged.</p>
  <p>Proposals should reflect relevant advances in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research and evaluation methodologies and provide a compelling argument about how the methodologies proposed are appropriately matched with strategic research questions. Additionally, proposals should demonstrate how the methods chosen would result in rigorous, cumulative, reproducible, and usable findings.</p>
  <p>Potential education research topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Factors contributing to enhanced retention of students, completion of
      their degrees, and successful placement in STEM careers, particularly for
      students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including women and
      persons with disabilities</li>
            <li>Identification of successful education models in various STEM fields,
                  definitions of what constitutes successful outcomes, and the factors associated
            with these outcomes</li>
            <li>Strategies for strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to provide academically
            excellent STEM undergraduate programs</li>
            <li>Investigations of the impact of HBCU-UP projects on the quality of STEM
            undergraduate education.</li>
            <li>Mechanisms to redesign STEM education in response to changes in traditional
                  disciplines, efforts to enhance curricula and learning, and the incorporation
            of STEM research into teaching</li>
            <li>Impacts of and partnerships with industry, K-12 schools, and informal
            education settings</li>
            <li>Investigations of the causes, consequences, and performance of STEM-oriented
            intervention programs or public policies</li>
            <li>Research on teachers' implementation of culturally relevant strategies
            to improve student STEM achievement</li>
            <li>Investigations of effective STEM teacher preparation methods that address
            preparation for multi-cultural classrooms</li>
          </ul>
  <p>Proposers are encouraged to contact the Division of Research, Evaluation
    and Communication (REC) education research program director listed in the
    Contacts for Additional Information section of this solicitation to discuss
    potential research questions and research methodologies. For general questions
    and proposal process questions please contact one of the Cognizant Program

    <p><strong> TARGETED INFUSION PROJECTS</strong>: One to two-year projects to meet a short term, well defined goal to improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Project activities must be extremely focused in order to meet a very well
    defined short term goal to build the quality of undergraduate education.
    Typically, projects are focused on one activity within a single STEM department.&nbsp; However, interdisciplinary and cross disciplinary projects are also encouraged.&nbsp; Projects
    aligned with the NSF-wide investment areas are highly encouraged <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/priority_areas/">(https://www.nsf.gov/news/priority_areas/</a>).&nbsp; NSF has designated eight areas as NSF-wide investments: Biocomplexity in the Environment, Climate Change Science Program, Cyberinfrastructure, Human and Social Dynamics, International Polar Year, Mathematical Sciences, National Nanotechnology Initiative and Networking Information Technology R&amp;D.</p>
  <p>Do not submit proposals to TIP that support scientific or engineering research
    even if undergraduates are involved in the research.&nbsp; These activities
    do not fit into the goal of the TIP initiative and can be supported by research
    grant programs within the NSF science and engineering Directorates (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/">https://www.nsf.gov/funding/</a>).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Examples of Targeted Infusion Project goals include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Earn a new specialized accreditation or certification for a STEM degree
      program to improve the competitiveness of graduating students and recruit
      more students to the program.</li>
            <li>Establish a new STEM degree program or concentration to recruit more
            students into STEM.</li>
            <li>Build on-site teaching and research infrastructure to improve the preparedness
                  and competitiveness of graduating students for graduate school and to recruit
            qualified STEM faculty.</li>
            <li>Enhance the quality of STEM teacher preparation by establishing a collaboration
                  between the STEM faculty and STEM teacher education programs to provide
                  active learning experiences for undergraduates studying to become STEM
            teachers.</li>
            <li>Revamp a STEM degree program in order to reflect advances in the discipline
                  or changes in workforce requirements to improve the preparedness and competitiveness
            of graduating students for graduate school or the workforce.</li>
          </ul>
  <p>Competitive projects will clearly outline how the activities will result in an overall enhancement of the current STEM programs. Appropriate short term goals are easily measurable and attainable within the project time frame. Activities could include but are not limited to: curriculum enhancement, travel, training related to the project, new course development, new degree program development, and equipment acquisitions. The activities must clearly lead to the specific short term goal of the project. Proposals that include normal operating activities such as salaries to teach existing classes, and normal recruitment and outreach activities, will not be funded. HBCUs that currently have a five-year Implementation Project will need to explain how the Targeted Infusion Project is unique from the Implementation Project activities.</p>
  <p>Proposers are encouraged to contact the discipline appropriate NSF contact
    person listed in the Contacts for Additional Information section of this
    solicitation to discuss proposed project activities and goals of a potential
    Targeted Infusion Project. Proposers interested in establishing collaborations
    between STEM disciplines and STEM teacher education programs are encouraged
    to contact the Division of Elementary, Secondary and Informal Education (ESIE)
    teacher education program director listed.&nbsp; For general questions and proposal process questions please contact one of the Cognizant Program Officers listed at the beginning of this solicitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Targeted
    Infusion Proposals are not supplements to existing HBCU-UP projects - HBCUs
    do not need to have an Implementation Project in order to submit Targeted
    Infusion proposals.</p>

                or are currently active.&nbsp; Include other NSF programs (for example
                the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) or
                the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program),
                other Federal programs (for example the Minority Science and Engineering
                Improvement Program (MSEIP) or the Minority Access to Research Careers
                (MARC) program), State programs, and institution programs.
              <ul>
                <li> For institutions that have previously received an HBCU-UP
                    Implementation Project award you must discuss the goals and outcomes
                    of that project. You should at least address the following questions
                    concerning your previous HBCU-UP project:
                  <ul>
                    <li>What were the objectives and goals of the project (numerical
                    when possible)?</li>
                    <li>What activities were implemented?</li>
                    <li>What were the results of the activities (numerical when
                    possible)?</li>
                    <li>Have the activities been institutionalized? If not, why
                    not?</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For institutions that have received an HBCU-UP Planning Grant, you must describe the planning grant activities and the findings of those activities.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Describe how the proposed Implementation Project goals and objectives
                fit the institution&rsquo;s mission and reflect the institution's
            long-term STEM goals and plans.</li>
            <li>Provide evidence of the commitment&nbsp;to the proposed Implementation Project activities of the institutional administration, partners and collaborators if applicable, and the STEM faculty and leadership.&nbsp; Letters of commitment to the proposed project activities can be included as supplementary documents.&nbsp; Do
                not include general letters of support from individuals not involved
            in the implementation of project activities.</li>
          </ul>
      <p><strong>Proposed Implementation Activities</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Describe the proposed activities that will be implemented. Competitive
          proposals will provide answers to following questions for each proposed
          activity:
          <ul>
            <li>WHAT: What are the goals and objectives? Include the number
              of STEM students and faculty that will be impacted by the activity
              each year of the project. Describe whether the proposed activity
              addresses the needs of other underrepresented groups, such as
              women and persons with disabilities, in addition to minority
              populations .</li>
                <li>HOW: Describe the activity that will be implemented in order
                    to achieve these goals and objectives. Include enough details
                    so that the scope of your proposed activity is clear. What are
                    the strategies and methods that will be used? How will the activity
                be sustained after NSF funding ends?</li>
                <li>WHY: Provide evidence that the proposed activity is based on
                    research and/or other projects that have been shown to be effective
                    in achieving similar goals and objectives. What are the expected
                outcomes and impacts of the activity at your institution?</li>
                <li>WHEN and WHO: Outline the five-year timeline for the proposed
                    activity with measurable milestones. Include the project staff,
                    administrators, and/or partners that are responsible for the
                activity and milestones.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Describe plans to disseminate the outcomes of the project to appropriate
            audiences.</li>
            <li> Institutions that have previously received an HBCU-UP implementation
                award will also need to explain:
              <ul>
                <li>How the proposed activities will build on the previous project
                and not just continue previous activities.</li>
                <li>How the proposed activities will move the institution to the
                next level of STEM program quality.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
      <p><strong>Project Management and Evaluation</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Provide a management plan and timeline for the project that will
          ensure that the activities will be implemented on time, within budget,
          and the required reporting will be accurately completed and submitted.
          Include your plans for collecting and submitting SEIS data annually
          and at the end of the project.&nbsp; The timeline should include the project&rsquo;s
          major activities and milestones and identify who will be responsible
          for completing each activity.
          <ul>
            <li>You should review SEIS to determine whether your institution
              has the infrastructure and personnel to collect and submit the
              required data.&nbsp; If your institution does not currently have the infrastructure and personnel you can budget for data collection in your proposal.&nbsp; You
              can download a copy of the SEIS questions at <a href="http://www.systemic.com/pdfs/Sample_Cohort_6_SEIS05.pdf">http://www.systemic.com/pdfs/Sample_Cohort_6_SEIS05.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> The project staff and organization will depend on the design,
                scope, and disciplines involved.&nbsp; It is helpful to include a
                project organizational chart showing how the project fits into the
                institution's hierarchy
              <ul>
                <li>The Principal Investigator (PI) should be the chief academic
                    officer of the institution since many proposed project activities
                    will require this level of stewardship in order for them to be
                implemented.</li>
                <li>The Project Manager should be the co-PI who will have the most
                day-to-day contact with the project.</li>
                <li>Most projects should have an Internal Steering Committee or
                    Internal Advisory Committee to help manage the project implementation,
                    resolve project issues, and ensure that the project is on track
                    for meeting project goals. &nbsp;The size and composition will depend on the design of the project - members could include STEM faculty, institutional staff who provide student and faculty services that are included in the project, and representatives from related STEM projects.&nbsp; This committee should meet frequently throughout the project.&nbsp; Include
                    a description of the membership, schedule of meetings, and the
                responsibilities and duties of the committee.</li>
                <li>HBCU-UP requires that Implementation projects have an External
                    Advisory Committee that meets at least once a year, chaired by
                    the chief executive officer of the institution. The External
                    Advisory Committee should have representatives equivalent to
                    the chief executive officer that can advise the project management
                    team on the implementation of the project and progress toward
                    project goals.&nbsp; Members could include leaders from other institutions of higher education, industry representatives, and representatives from feeder school districts and community colleges.&nbsp; The
                    PI, co-PIs, and project staff involved in the implementation
                    of the project activities should not serve on the External Advisory
                    Committee. Include a description of the proposed membership,
                    schedule of meetings, and the responsibilities and duties of
                the committee.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evaluation and assessment:&nbsp; It is expected that each project will include a formative and summative evaluation plan. The evaluation plan should refer to the objectives, goals, and baseline data already presented within the description of the proposed project activities.&nbsp; The formative evaluation should include benchmarks and indicators of progress that demonstrate the proposers' understanding of the essential quantitative and qualitative indicators for assessing the project's implementation processes.&nbsp; The summative evaluation should assess whether the project achieved the overall project goals as well as identify any unexpected results.&nbsp; The
                collection and reporting of SEIS data alone are not sufficient for
            project evaluation.</li>

                      will do this additional data collection and analysis?</li>
                    <li>You should describe any previous work that has been
                            done, such as surveys of students and faculty or previous
                            accreditation activities, which will be used as part

            </li>
            <li>In general, implementation activities are not allowed under planning
                  grants.&nbsp; In some cases, pilot activities may be appropriate if an innovative strategy is proposed which needs to be tested before full implementation.&nbsp; If

          ensure that the activities will be implemented on time, within budget,
          and the required reporting will be accurately completed and submitted.
          The timeline should include the Planning Grant&rsquo;s major activities
          and milestones and identify who will be responsible for completing
          each activity.</li>
            <li> Project staff organization - staffing requirements will depend
                  on the design and scope of the Planning Grant.

                      implementation, resolve any issues, and ensure that the Planning
                      Grant is on track.&nbsp; The size and composition can vary - members could include institutional leadership, STEM faculty not already involved in the planning activities, institutional staff who provide student and faculty services that may be&nbsp;included in an Implementation&nbsp; project, and representatives from related STEM projects.&nbsp; This committee should meet frequently throughout the project.&nbsp; Include

            <li>Describe the benefits of achieving the goal to the STEM education
                  and research enterprise at the institution.&nbsp; For example, implementing
                  the project will make your graduates more competitive in the workforce
                  and graduate school, or better prepare them for success in the workforce

          </ul>
      <p><strong>Project Management and Evaluation</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a management plan for the project that will ensure that
          the activities and the required reporting will be implemented on
          time and within budget.</li>
            <li>Provide a timeline for the activities to be implemented - include
                  measurable objectives and outcomes and the staff that are responsible
            for doing the activities.</li>
            <li>Evaluation and assessment:&nbsp; It is expected that each Targeted Infusion proposal will include a formative and summative evaluation plan. The evaluation plan should refer to the objectives, goals and baseline data presented within the description of the proposed Targeted Infusion Project activities.&nbsp; The formative evaluation should include benchmarks and indicators of progress that demonstrate the proposers' understanding of the essential quantitative and qualitative indicators for assessing the implementation processes of the Targeted Infusion Project.&nbsp; The
                  summative evaluation should assess whether the Targeted Infusion
                  Project achieved the overall goals as well as identify any unexpected
            results.</li>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program and, if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with the proposer.</p>

<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong></h4>
<p><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a>  </p>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board
  (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts
  of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional
  criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs
  and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria
  include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions
  and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address
  both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations
  that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer
  is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the
    proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How important is the proposed activity to
    advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different
    fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct
    the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the
    prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore
    creative and original concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
    activity? Is there sufficient access to resources? </p>
  <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
    How
    well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting
    teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden
    the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability,
    geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research
    and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?
    Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
    understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
    One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration
    of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports
    at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities
    where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators,
    and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education
    with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of
    learning perspectives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects,
    and Activities</strong></em><br />
    Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens --
    women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
    -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF
    is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs,
    projects, and activities it considers and supports. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the date of receipt.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
<a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>
<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong><span>
<p><em>Reverse Site Visits: </em>Participation in a Reverse Site Visit (RSV) can be requested by NSF at anytime during the grant period. The RSV is a presentation on the outcomes and progress of the grant activities at NSF in front of a peer review panel. Participation in the RSV is required by the appropriate grant management team and institutional administration.</p>
<p><em>Site Visits:</em> NSF staff may visit the site of the grant project at anytime during the grant period. Reasonable accommodation of the site visit by NSF program staff is required by the grantee.</p>
<p><em>Cooperation with NSF evaluation projects and special projects:</em> NSF, an NSF contractor, or a grantee on behalf of NSF, may from time to time conduct program evaluations or special projects of HBCU-UP projects. These may occur at anytime during the grant period and sometimes after the grant period has ended. Reasonable cooperation with these efforts is required by the grantee.</p></span><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>
<span>
<p>HBCU-UP Implementation Project awardees are required to submit data via the
  SEIS each year of the award and after the award is over. This is in addition
  to the annual project reports and the final project report submitted to the
  cognizant Program Officer via FastLane. The SEIS data is used by NSF to assess
  project progress as well as for HBCU-UP outcomes at the program level for Government
  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) reporting and other reporting requirements.
  SEIS data will only be published outside of normal NSF reporting requirements
  as aggregate data unless permission from the institution is received to publish
  the data individually.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
