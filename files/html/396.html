        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>Proposals are solicited to manage and operate the Gemini Observatory through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The Gemini Observatory is an international collaboration currently consisting of the funding partners of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as host institutions in Chile and Hawai'i.  The Gemini Partnership operates twin optical/infrared optimized 8 m diameter telescopes on the superb sites of Mauna Kea, Hawai'i and Cerro Pach&oacute;n, Chile, providing large light-collecting areas, exquisite image quality, high infrared transparency (especially at Mauna Kea), agile and efficient scheduling queues, access to the entire sky, and well-developed infrastructures. Gemini North and Gemini South have carried out scientific operations since 2000 and 2001, respectively, addressing fundamental scientific questions with new observational and operational techniques.</p>
            <p>The terms under which the Partnership currently operates are codified in the International Gemini Agreement<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, signed through the end of calendar 2015 by the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile.  An updated version of this agreement, which will apply through the end of calendar 2021, is being finalized by the partners and a draft version of this document will be made available to proposers as part of the resource library being compiled for this solicitation. The Gemini agreement specifies the roles of the NSF, the Gemini Board, and the managing organization.  Namely,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The NSF serves in two capacities in the Gemini Partnership.  It acts as Executive Agency according to the terms of the International Gemini Agreement, and as such is empowered to act on behalf of the Partnership to execute necessary administrative actions.  In addition, the NSF serves as the U.S. funding agency, having programmatic responsibility for oversight of U.S. interests in the Partnership.</li>
              <li>The Gemini Board is a supervisory and regulatory body responsible for budgetary and policy oversight, guidance of the managing organization for Gemini, and review of the terms of the award between the Executive Agency and managing organization.  The Gemini Board is composed of representatives from each of the partner countries, in approximate proportion to partner share.  U.S. members include an NSF representative and members of the U.S. scientific community.</li>
              <li>According to terms set forth in the Gemini Agreement, the appointment of the managing organization for Gemini includes review and approval by the partners.  Funding is accomplished through a cooperative agreement (CA) between the NSF and the managing organization.  The Awardee resulting from this solicitation will serve as the managing organization, as defined in the Gemini Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Awardee will work closely with NSF and the scientific community to ensure that the Gemini Observatory continues to support, sustain and advance frontier science as enabled by Gemini&rsquo;s unique research capabilities and as promoted through a culture of excellence. In cooperation with NSF and within available resources, Gemini will plan and execute a viable, coherent and inclusive program of research and education, consistent with the objectives and priorities of the scientific community. The Awardee will manage facilities and equipment provided by NSF, will provide and develop additional equipment as necessary to fulfill the approved programmatic scope, and will provide support and technical personnel to manage the Gemini Observatory as a well-integrated research and education facility.</p>
            <p>Proposals should describe how the proposing institution(s) will provide observing capabilities and access to the resulting scientific data; facilitate an integrated program of research, education, training and outreach; maintain instruments, facilities and infrastructure; manage and develop a skilled and diverse workforce; and establish appropriate relationships with universities, industry, private organizations and the international community to support the mission of the Observatory.</p>
            <p>The successful proposal will be awarded as a cooperative agreement(s) with a duration of six (6) years beginning January 1, 2017.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National Science Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential. To achieve these goals, NSF supports facilities that provide research capabilities in various scientific disciplines. One such facility, the Gemini Observatory, provides telescope capabilities and instrumentation for research in optical and infrared astronomy, as well as public information and outreach to enrich the understanding of the universe among the communities in the host and partner countries.</p>
          <p>The stated mission of the Gemini Observatory is</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To advance our knowledge of the Universe by providing the international Gemini Community with forefront access to the entire sky.</em></p>
          <p>The Gemini Observatory is currently adjusting to a reduction of approximately 23% in operations budget due to the 2012 withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Partnership. As detailed in the Observatory&rsquo;s program plans<sup><a title="" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></sup>, modifications in operations model and scope required by this reduction in funding include a reduced instrument complement available at each telescope, migration of observing personnel from the mountain summits to operations basecamps, a reduction in institutional research, and more limited development activities.  This adjustment is scheduled to be complete by the inception of the award under consideration here, and the Awardee should plan on an approximately uniform level of partner funding for the duration of the agreement, adjusted for inflation, as described in Section III of this solicitation.</p>
           
            <div id="ftn1">The Gemini Observatory is currently managed through a cooperative agreement with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The National Science Board (NSB) has adopted the principle that NSF awards should be competed to assure the best use of NSF funds for supporting research and education (NSB-08-12). Through this program solicitation, NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST), hereby solicits proposals for the management and operation of the Gemini Observatory through a cooperative agreement(s) beginning January 1, 2017, and continuing through a six-year award period.</div>

Researchers use Gemini to study such diverse topics as the solar system and exoplanets, planetary nebulae, star formation, supernovae, the formation and evolution of galaxies, quasars and supermassive black holes, and the structure of the universe on the largest scales.</p>
          <p>The Gemini North telescope is one of four 8&ndash;10 m class optical/infrared telescopes that stand atop the 4213 m (13,822 ft) summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawai'i.  Mauna Kea is generally acclaimed as the world&rsquo;s premier Northern Hemisphere observing site, being surrounded by a thermally-stable tropical sea, located atop a massive mountain with very gradual slopes that are bathed in dry trade winds above the inversion layer, and absent of major sources of light pollution. In Chile, sharing much of the common infrastructure with the telescope facilities on nearby Cerro Tololo, the Gemini South telescope is situated on a ridge in the foothills of the Andes at 2722 m (8930 ft) elevation on Cerro Pach&oacute;n, and less than 1.5 km from the site of the revolutionary Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which is currently scheduled for first light during the interval covered by this award. The Cerro Tololo/Pach&oacute;n astronomical complex is one of the darkest, driest, and best-developed sites in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
          <p>The Gemini telescopes utilize exquisitely figured 8 m diameter monolithic primary mirrors and each incorporates laser-assisted adaptive optics to greatly improve the image sharpness over what is otherwise available from the ground.  At Gemini South, the state-of-the-art Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System, GeMS, corrects for distortions introduced at multiple levels through the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and over a wider field of view, than has been achieved at any other telescope in the world. Both Gemini telescopes are distinct among 8&ndash;10 m class observatories in their highly optimized infrared design.  The telescopes employ unique sputtered multilayered silver coatings on their primary, secondary, and tertiary mirrors that, together with other facets of their design, achieve extremely low emissivity, diffraction-limited performance at near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths, and smooth, stable point-spread functions.  The durability and quality of the coatings, coupled with preventive maintenance techniques, have extended the time interval between re-coatings to a nominal five years.  The result is reduced downtime.</p>
          <p>Each of the Gemini telescopes feeds a modern suite of imagers and spectrometers, which collectively provide the Gemini community with access to the optical and near-infrared ground-accessible spectral windows.  The Gemini Multi-object Spectrometer/Imagers (GMOS) are workhorse instruments available at both sites, while Gemini South features the near-infrared Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI) and the facility near-infrared wide-field imager and multi-object spectrograph, FLAMINGOS-2.  Commissioned during the past year is the world-leading high-contrast coronagraphic Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), which will be employed in an extensive campaign to image and characterize planets orbiting nearby stars starting in 2014. Additional instruments for Gemini North include the versatile Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI), as well as a natural/laser guide-star adaptive optics system.  The Gemini High-resolution Optical Spectrometer (GHOS) is currently in development.  By resolution of the Gemini Board, a maximum of four instruments, plus adaptive optics, will be maintained as facility instruments for each telescope.  However, visitor instruments are supported on a limited basis at both sites, to enable capabilities not otherwise covered by facility instrumentation.</p>
          <p>The telescope design utilizes a Cassegrain focal turret, with three instruments nominally mounted concurrently, plus an adaptive optics system that can feed any instrument, and a calibration system.  Redirecting the beam with a movable mirror allows almost instantaneous instrument changes and on-the-fly responses to changing sky or instrument conditions, or to support time-critical observations.  Instruments are typically mounted for periods of months, thereby reducing lost observing time and expense due to frequent changes. The instruments are highly integrated into Gemini&rsquo;s control systems and are amenable to both queue and classical observing.</p>
          <p>Though a proposer may advocate an alternate arrangement, Gemini&rsquo;s Hilo Base Facility is the current headquarters for the Gemini directorate as well as the administrative core for Gemini North and is located in an NSF-owned facility on a tract leased to the NSF at the University Research Park of the University of Hawai'i-Hilo.  The current Gemini South Base Facility is situated within the same gated compound as the operations bases for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope. Each base facility provides office and lab space for science, engineering, and administrative staff, and supports data processing and remote operations for the local telescope.</p>
          <p>Time on the Gemini telescopes is awarded to each of the partners&rsquo; national communities in proportion to its financial contribution to capital investments and operating costs of the Observatory.  Each partner has its own National Gemini Office (NGO) which acts as the interface between their national community and the Gemini Observatory.  The NGOs interact with the Observatory on several planes, the most fundamental being the management of a National Time Allocation Committee (NTAC) in each respective country.  The NTACs collect, peer-review, and prioritize the observing proposals from their respective constituents each semester.  The results of all of the NTAC deliberations are then forwarded to the International Time Allocation Committee (ITAC), composed of representatives of the national partners and the Observatory staff, where national evaluations are merged and a consensus ranking of the entire set is reached.  Finally, proposals are grouped into three broad prioritized categories, referred to as Bands 1, 2 and 3, and the Observatory schedules the Bands according to the overarching national observing-time fractions.  Mechanisms to enable Target of Opportunity (rapid-response) and Large/Long Term observing programs are also in place.</p>
          <p>In seeking to optimize the scientific return on investments made, Gemini offers both queue and classical observing modes.  Gemini&rsquo;s rapidly reconfigurable multi-instrument Cassegrain focal cubes are key elements of Gemini&rsquo;s observing queue: the scientific ranking of a program determines its priority for execution, and every attempt is made to complete each high-priority program under the sky conditions it requires.  Queue-based operations rely upon the Observatory staff to conduct researchers&rsquo; observations by executing preprogrammed scripts that are designed by the researcher.  When appropriate to the study in question, a queue-based model is able to make efficient use of oversubscribed observing time.  Observations and calibrations can be optimally utilized across multiple programs, enhancing the science productivity of the Observatory.  Classical observing &ndash; hands-on observing by the Principal Investigator team using a fixed block of time &ndash; has also proven to be desirable and is the preferred mode for activities such as programs that involve visitor instruments, experimental observing procedures, the training of young scientists, technology explorations, and instrument commissioning.  Moreover, these programs familiarize astronomers from the community with Gemini and encourage close contact with Gemini scientists.  Additional measures to improve efficiency and connect the Observatory with its constituents include the development of (1) eavesdropping, (2) basecamp, and (3) remote observing.  These capabilities, being phased in sequentially, will provide for (1) monitoring an observational program by a PI from his/her home institution, (2) the execution of a classical program from the base facility as opposed to being resident on the mountain summit, and (3) full remote execution of a program from an observer&rsquo;s home institution, respectively.</p>
          <p><strong>B. Governance under the Gemini Partnership</strong></p>
          <p>Over 20 years ago, discussions within an international group of astronomers and technologists developed the idea for a ground-based observatory with two telescopes - one in the northern hemisphere and the other in the south - each telescope utilizing a single-piece mirror of very large collecting area and capable of superb image quality and infrared performance under the best observing conditions.  As a result of these efforts, in 1993 and 1994 the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil came together to form the government-to-government Gemini Partnership.  The Partnership has evolved to the current formulation of the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Argentina as funding partners whose astronomical communities receive observing time in proportion to their fractional financial contribution, plus the site hosts of Chile and the University of Hawai'i, each of which receive 10% of the observing time on the local telescope.  According to the Gemini Agreement, partners&rsquo; intentions for remaining with or withdrawing from the Partnership are declared for periods of nominally three years, with Australia having declared at the 2012 assessment point that it is not able to commit funds toward continued participation beyond the end of calendar 2015.  In response to this announcement, the Gemini Board is discussing opportunities with other potentially interested institutions to participate in the Partnership.</p>
          <p>The Gemini Observatory serves the interests of all its member countries, as provided for in the Gemini Agreement.  The primary governing body is the Gemini Board, a supervisory and regulatory body responsible for exercising budgetary and policy control for the Observatory and providing guidance to the managing organization (here the Awardee).  The broad oversight functions of the Gemini Board are defined in the Gemini Agreement. The Gemini Board is composed of representatives from each of the partner funding agencies and scientific communities, in approximate proportion to their partner share. The Board provides the forum for partner interaction and appoints subcommittees as necessary. The Gemini Board has reserved the right to approve the appointment of the Gemini Director.  Observatory policy is directed by means of Gemini Board resolutions, which may be found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.gemini.edu/science/#gbod">http://www.gemini.edu/science/#gbod</a>.</p>
          <p>The Gemini Agreement also establishes an Executive Agency, empowered to act on behalf of the Partnership to execute Gemini, and names NSF to serve in that capacity. The Executive Agency acts as the sole conduit for funding from all partners and conveys Gemini Board-established policy guidelines for the Observatory through the managing organization. NSF provides oversight on behalf of the Gemini Board, particularly through periodic reviews, and, as specified in the Gemini Agreement, provides the Executive Secretariat for the Gemini Board.</p>
          <p>The Gemini Observatory Director is responsible to the Gemini Board and managing organization for the overall operation of the Observatory. The Director defines and carries out the overall scientific mission of the Observatory as approved by the Gemini Board, and provides scientific and management leadership. The Director also ensures that the Observatory is in compliance with Federal and other regulatory requirements. The Director establishes a senior Observatory management team to lead activity in major Observatory functions which currently consists of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deputy Director / Head of Science</li>
            <li>Associate Director, Operations</li>
            <li>Associate Director, Development</li>
            <li>Chief Financial Officer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The activities are coordinated in an integrated structure across the two sites that allows for common management practices.</p>
          <p>The Gemini Science and Technology Advisory Committee (STAC) is advisory to the Gemini Board, providing scientific and technical expertise to assess both short and long term plans for the development of telescope capabilities and associated instrumentation.  The STAC therefore has a crucial role in defining and guiding Gemini&rsquo;s strategic scientific vision.  Like the Gemini Board itself, membership on the STAC is approximately representative of partner share.</p>
          <p>A second committee charged with advising the Gemini Board is the Gemini Finance Committee (GFC), comprised of financial authorities from the funding partners. The GFC considers financial documents, budget reports, and long range plans for the Observatory.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Gemini User Committee is comprised of representatives from the Gemini partner community and concentrates on the short-term functional concerns of users.  While the committee reports to the Gemini Director, both the Observatory and the NGOs have important roles in receiving and responding to this user feedback.</p>
          <p><strong>C. Description of Awardee Responsibilities</strong></p>

          </ul>
          <p><em>3.     </em><em>Management</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will define and implement an organizational structure for the Gemini Observatory that will provide vision, leadership and service to manage the Observatory as a vibrant, community-serving facility.  Models and approaches for observatory management should be consistent with NSF goals, the needs of Gemini&rsquo;s scientific community, and the requirements described in this solicitation. Organizational structures for Gemini management and operations may include the establishment of new institutions, corporations or consortia, provided that the proposing organization(s) provide materials in support of the financial capability of the Awardee(s), as required in Section V.B.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will establish processes within a structured framework for planning, review and performance management, including the development and use of appropriate mechanisms to aid both the Awardee and Gemini&rsquo;s stakeholders in assessing performance and identifying areas for improvement.</p>
          <p><em>4.     </em><em>Operations</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will be responsible for staffing and managing Gemini to ensure that on-site instruments are able to operate in response to high-priority scientific research conducted by qualified scientists.  To this end the Awardee will articulate a strategic plan for maintaining a viable, community-driven scope of observatory operations and will employ mechanisms for reviewing and scheduling user access through an open process that demonstrates NSF core values.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will provide a data management plan that describes the acquisition, analysis, archiving and accessibility of all data, including the definition of proprietary periods and appropriate cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity to meet the proposed scope of user community support.</p>
          <p><em>5.     </em><em>Maintenance</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">All parts of the Gemini infrastructure that are necessary to meet the proposed operations activities will be competently maintained to enable the attainment of program objectives and for the safety and security of staff and visitors. The Awardee will be responsible for budgeting, scheduling and tracking a comprehensive safety, environmental compliance and maintenance plan for all parts of the Gemini infrastructure, including plans, as appropriate, to remove or dispose of those parts of the infrastructure deemed unnecessary for the proposed level of operations.</p>
          <p><em>6.     </em><em>Science</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will prepare an Annual Report and Program Plan for Gemini that demonstrates responsiveness to community-based scientific objectives, an innovative vision built on existing and potential capabilities, a well-defined scope of high-priority activities, and a credible plan for establishing the necessary resources to support the proposed suite of activities.  In addition, the Awardee will develop and annually update a Long-Range Plan that outlines the strategic vision for Gemini over a time span of at least five years, and considers the Observatory&rsquo;s role in meeting the needs of the partner community in the context of the continually evolving scientific and technological landscapes.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">As defined by these proposed plans, the Awardee will ensure that Gemini has sufficient internal or external expertise to (1) support outside users, (2) help guide decisions relating to current and future instrumentation and observing modes, (3) develop and maintain data acquisition and data processing software, (4) develop and implement policies and strategies for validating data quality, providing data accessibility and data archiving.</p>
          <p><em>7.     </em><em>Staffing</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee will recruit, retain and develop an expert scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff, consistent with the NSF strategic goal of cultivating a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce. Proposers should include a staffing plan that identifies the roles and responsibilities of lead personnel and delineates the organizational structure, including full-time equivalent estimates, position titles, and location, that supports them. </p>
          <p><em>8.     </em><em>Diversity</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Gemini offers significant potential to enable the participation of traditionally underrepresented and underserved communities in the research and education mission of the Observatory and to strengthen the strategic growth of a scientific and technically trained workforce. The Awardee will demonstrate leadership in employing best practices for broadening participation in science and engineering at all levels within the Observatory&rsquo;s activities.</p>
          <p><em>9.     </em><em>Education and Public Outreach</em></p>
          <p>Gemini currently operates a vigorous program of education, outreach and community development activities that includes collaborations with undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, student involvement in Gemini research, and resources for K&ndash;12 students and teachers in Hawai'i and Chile.  The Awardee will be responsible for developing and implementing an innovative, integrated program of research and education that builds on Gemini's scientific strengths and on its local context to advance NSF strategic goals.</p>
          <p>10.   <em>Collaborations</em></p>
          <p>Gemini is an international partnership with a number of different stakeholders.  The Awardee must be sensitive to the needs of these stakeholders, as represented on the Gemini Board, by proposing and carrying out programs that are consistent with the various perspectives of the partners.  Any programs that are conducted as collaborations between Gemini and other organizations must be consistent with the Gemini mission and complement and enhance activities funded and approved by the Partnership.</p>
          <p><em>11.   </em><em>Managing Organization&rsquo;s Juridical Status in Chile</em></p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Awardee is responsible for complying with all applicable laws of the location in which it operates.  Accordingly, proposers must demonstrate the capability and authority to conduct operations in Chile, including the employment of Chileans. Recognizing that obtaining the necessary authority may require an extended time period, proposers must demonstrate knowledge of what is required to obtain the necessary authorities, if they do not already have such authority. Proposers should seek their own counsel regarding the laws of Chile.  As a starting point, proposers should familiarize themselves with Chile laws No. 15,172 and No. 17,318 and consider conducting provisional consultations with an appropriate representative of the University of Chile.  Other laws with which proposers should familiarize themselves include, but are not limited to, Chilean laws regarding labor and employment.</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chilean operations for Gemini are administered by the current managing organization, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy Inc. (AURA).  Gemini facilities include offices and labs in La Serena, Chile (about 500 km north of Santiago) and an astronomical observing site on Cerro Pach&oacute;n, approximately 60 km from La Serena.  All of the Chilean land on which Gemini facilities reside is owned by AURA, a U.S. non-profit corporation.  The current Cooperative Agreement (CA) between NSF and AURA stipulates:</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>In the event that AURA ceases to be the managing organization for the Gemini Observatory, AURA agrees that it shall enter into a lease agreement with a successor managing organization(s) designated by NSF. The successor managing organization will have access to and use of all real and personal property necessary for continuing operations located in Chile which was acquired hereunder, and titled in AURA and which NSF determines are reasonably necessary for the operation of Gemini South as an astronomical research observatory. Such lease arrangement will be made available to the successor organization(s) at a rate of $1 per year for as long as such property is used and maintained for astronomical research. This lease shall be for a period of 25 years and in view of the intent to maintain such property for the use of astronomy, shall be renewable in 25-year increments by mutual consent. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld by either AURA or NSF.</em></p>

          III. AWARD INFORMATION
        </h3>
         
          <p>The award will be a cooperative agreement for a duration of six years, covering the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2022.</p>
          <p>Funds for the Gemini Observatory are provided through annual contributions by the partners in two distinct categories: (1) an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) fund and (2) an instrumentation development fund (IDF). The latter category is essentially a capital development fund that enables the development of new astronomical instrumentation and provides for major upgrades to existing instruments.  Intended contributions to each fund are declared by the partners prior to the inception of a cooperative agreement, with the O&amp;M contribution determining a partner&rsquo;s share in the collaboration and the IDF component regarded as a best-effort contribution that is subject to a partner&rsquo;s year-to-year funding picture. The funding and budgetary history for Gemini can be found in Gemini Board resolutions and annual reports contained in the resource library. For the purposes of planning as applicable to the writing of a proposal in response to this solicitation, the O&amp;M budget should match the annual anticipated partner contributions, which for CY2017<a title="" name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> should be taken to be $28.172M.  Over the lifetime of the award the O&amp;M component should total $182.229M.</p>
          <p>New facility instruments and major upgrades can be acquired through competitively-awarded contracts of IDF funds to development groups within the partnership or through transfers of separately-funded items to the observatory as in-kind contributions to the IDF from one or more partners.  Therefore, the observatory need not be staffed to undertake large technology development efforts in-house, but should include appropriate personnel to manage and monitor these development efforts, as well as to provide the necessary hardware and software interface.  Note also that IDF funds are accumulated into spending authority for use as periodic payments on major development projects, so significant IDF carry-forward as well as multi-year contractual obligations (e.g., the GHOS optical spectrometer construction) are likely to exist at the inception of the award. An Awardee other than the incumbent will be expected to assume these obligations and formally accept transfer of ownership of all existing contracts, including their terms and conditions and responsibility for execution, from the incumbent prior to inception of the award. Information on these obligations can be found in the resource library.</p>
          <p>For the reasons described above, IDF contributions to Gemini tend to fluctuate, but proposers may assume an equivalent contribution of $4.000M in 2017, made through a combination of contributed funds and in-kind developments and products.  These levels of support are indicated in the table below.</p>

          <p>For calendar years 2018-2022, proposers should assume an escalation factor of 3% annually for both O&amp;M and IDF categories.  The escalation factor is derived from consideration of projections for inflation factors for U.S. wage earners and includes the complexities of planning operating costs in Chile with Chilean inflation and legal requirements for employees' salary increases.  The escalation is intended to maintain a constant level of purchasing power.  Actual funding levels will be established on the basis of annual program plans submitted by the Awardee to NSF and approved by NSF, subject to the availability of contributed funds and to the performance of both the Awardee and Observatory.</p>
          <p>In the event that a new Awardee is selected to replace the incumbent, NSF will fund additional, appropriate, transition costs through a cooperative support agreement with the new Awardee for a transition period of up to six months preceding the six-year cooperative agreement. Relevant transition activities include interviewing and hiring personnel, assigning subcontracts, transferring data and property, and obtaining permits and licenses. During this transition period, the new Awardee will have appropriate access to Gemini personnel and facilities.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Budgetary Information
        </h4>
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing:</strong></p>
        <p>Inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Other Budgetary Limitations:</strong></p>
        <p>Proposing organizations may include a fixed annual management fee in their proposed budget, and must include a brief justification for the fee in the budget justification. The management fee must be clearly identified as such.</p>
        <p><strong>Budget Preparation Instructions:</strong>  The full proposal should include a budget on the budget form in FastLane or the R&amp;R Budget Form in Grants.gov for each year of the six-year period proposed. The first year&rsquo;s operations and maintenance budget should equal the anticipated O&amp;M total contributions of $28,172,000, while CY2017 contributions to instrument development can be assumed to be equivalent to $4,000,000, made in the form of funds and/or in-kind partner contributions and developments. Subsequent years should be escalated by 3.0% per year, as described in Section III. A cumulative budget for the six-year award period will automatically be provided in FastLane and Grants.gov.</p>
        <p>The proposal should provide all staffing and budgeting information needed to describe how the organization will fulfill the expectations in Sections I and II of this solicitation. Requested budget amounts for each year of the proposal should reflect the level considered necessary to perform the NSF-funded activities described in the proposal. Proposers should be cognizant of budget constraints implied by the estimated funding levels provided under Section III. A budget justification shall be submitted with the budgets for each year of the award and shall be in sufficient detail to show how the proposer reached the amounts specified in the budget. The total length of these justifications should not exceed 20 pages.  NSF anticipates performing a detailed cost analysis of the successful proposal budget.</p>
        <p>Enter the anticipated total level of subcontract support on line G5, Subawards, of the FastLane budget or line F5 of the R&amp;R Budget Form in Grants.gov. Full proposals require the inclusion of separate budgets for subcontracts that exceed $250,000 per year. For subcontracts that would be less than $250,000 year, include the costs in the aggregate on the subaward line in the budget.</p>
        <p>Proposing organizations other than the incumbent must also provide a detailed budget for a transition period of up to six months preceding the new award. This information must be provided as part of the aforementioned Transition Plan that is submitted as Supplementary Documentation. The budget must be presented in the same style with all applicable budget line items as for the budget for each year of the proposal. If a new Awardee is selected to manage and operate Gemini, the incumbent will cooperate with the successor to the extent necessary to facilitate uninterrupted support for Gemini during the transition period and will provide transfer of legal rights to relevant property and equipment. NSF will support appropriate transition costs incurred by a successor Awardee if different from the current Awardee.</p>
        <p><strong>The transition budget should not include non-renewal costs of the incumbent. These include medical insurance, severance pay, or other costs incurred by the incumbent under the current cooperative agreement, including costs related to the nonrenewal of subcontracts.  If a new managing organization is selected, the incumbent may submit to NSF costs related to the cooperative agreement non-renewal, and these costs will be considered separately.</strong></p>
        <p>In a separate document labeled Financial Capability, proposing organizations must include information in support of the organization's financial condition and capability.  This material, which should be uploaded as a Single Copy Document, should provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A detailed structure and plan for implementing and monitoring business systems and internal controls for financial management and accounting, property standards, equipment standards, procurement standards, reporting and records management.</li>
          <li>A total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees, with supporting information such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys, and studies of professional, public and private organizations used in establishing the total compensation structure.</li>
          <li>If available, the organization's annual audited financial statements (e.g. Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Statement and Annual Reports) for the three most recent fiscal years and/or other documentation to clearly explain its current financial strength and resource capability.</li>
          <li>A current indirect cost rate proposal and supporting financial data. If the organization's indirect cost rates have been approved by a Federal agency, provide copies of such agreements.</li>
          <li>A current Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) Disclosure Statement or Cost Policy Statement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organizations that have not previously received NSF awards should review the NSF Prospective New Awardee Guide <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pnag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pnag</a> for additional guidance in preparing their budget submission.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
           <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        
        <p>For Full Proposals, reviewers will be asked to evaluate the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strengths and weaknesses of the proposed management approach;</li>
          <li>Strengths and weaknesses of the proposed budgeting and financial plans;</li>
          <li>Opportunities and potential benefits that the proposed approach presents for Gemini;</li>
          <li>Any risks to the future success of Gemini in the proposer's approach and the degree to which risks are addressed;</li>
          <li>Cost reasonableness and cost efficiency of the proposed approach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the process of formulating an overall assessment of the viability of the proposer's management and operations plan for Gemini, reviewers will consider each of the areas below.</p>
        <p>1. Management: overall management and financial plans</p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>

          <li>the adequacy and appropriateness of the organization's named personnel and proposed labor categories for fulfilling the Gemini mission;</li>
          <li>the suitability and potential for success of the proposed methods for recruitment and retention, promoting diversity at all levels in the organization, invigorating and training the workforce, and infusing new ideas and approaches in Gemini programs and administration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. Science and facility planning</p>
        <p>Reviewers will consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the ability to respond to and prioritize evolving scientific and engineering needs and opportunities in the community, particularly in response to changing budgetary environments;</li>
          <li>the degree to which the proposed programs, priorities and technical capabilities reflect the needs of Gemini stakeholder communities and utilize the unique research capabilities provided and facilitated by Gemini;</li>
          <li>the scope, feasibility and innovation of the planned activities;</li>
          <li>the extent to which planning targets critical goals relevant to the Gemini strategic vision, identifies challenging scientific and technical questions or barriers to be overcome, identifies performance measures for the planning and delivery process, and reflects appropriate and effective use of resources where possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5. Education, public outreach, and open access</p>
        <p>With due consideration of the funding limitations, reviewers will consider:</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p> Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Reverse Site Review.</p>
        <p>The panel will have access to the ad hoc reviews, and with its own deliberations will formulate an overall evaluation of each proposal. The panel membership will include experts in business practices and management of scientific organizations and will be representative of the range of interests present in the Gemini partnership.</p>
       
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
      
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p>The managing organization will be required to provide planning documents such as annual program plans and long-range plans, for all programs at Gemini, along with reports as may be required by NSF. Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), NSF is required to report on the Federal Performance Goals for Facilities. Any and all facilities with an annual budget exceeding a specific threshold must report on their operations activities; and any and all construction/upgrade projects that exceed a total project cost of a specific threshold must report on their construction/upgrade activities. Therefore, the Awardee will be required, upon request of the cognizant NSF program officer, to submit annual reports related to the GPRA performance goals. This may include the collection and submission of specific data related to the NSF GPRA requirements.</p>

        <h3>
          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>
