            <p><em>Transdisciplinary Research In Principles Of Data Science</em> (TRIPODS) aims to bring together the statistics, mathematics, and theoretical computer science communities to develop the theoretical foundations of data science through integrated research and training activities.  Phase I, described in this solicitation, will support the development of small collaborative Institutes.  Phase II (to be described in an anticipated future solicitation, subject to availability of funds) will support a smaller number of larger Institutes, selected from the Phase I Institutes via a second competitive proposal process.  All TRIPODS Institutes must involve significant and integral participation by all three of the aforementioned communities.</p>

          I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Technological advances, coupled with unprecedented access to computing infrastructure, have resulted in an explosion in the availability of data from disparate sources.  The National Science Foundation recently released a document, <em>10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments</em> (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/reports/nsf_big_ideas.pdf">https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/reports/nsf_big_ideas.pdf</a>), that seeks to "define a set of cutting-edge research agendas and processes."   One of the Big Ideas is <em>Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering, </em>described as "a bold initiative to develop a cohesive, national-scale approach to research data infrastructure and a 21st-century workforce capable of working effectively with data."  
          </p>
          <p>The document goes on to make the following points:</p>
          <ul>
         <li> The increasing speed at which we collect data, as well as the increasing volume and variety of that data, are profoundly transforming research in all fields of Science and Engineering (S&amp;E).</li>
         <li>This initiative will support basic research in mathematics, statistics and computer science that will enable data-driven discovery through visualization, better data mining, machine learning and more.</li></ul>
          <p>The Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) recognize the need for investments in data science, an important interdisciplinary field with significant impacts spanning many aspects of the modern world, including across government, industry, academia, and the general public.  While there have been significant investments related to the National Big Data Research and Development Initiative [see, for example, the Critical Techniques, Technologies and Methodologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Sciences and Engineering (BIGDATA), at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504767">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504767</a>], they have not focused specifically on foundational principles.  The TRIPODS program seeks to support research and training activities focused on the theoretical foundations of data science, i.e., the core algorithmic, mathematical, and statistical principles.</p>
          <p>In April 2016, DMS and CCF sponsored a workshop <em>Theoretical Foundations of Data Science (TFoDS): Algorithmic, Mathematical, and Statistical</em> (see <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.cs.rpi.edu/TFoDS/">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/TFoDS/</a>) that assembled leading researchers representing the three core disciplines of computer science, mathematics, and statistics.  A draft report is available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://www.cs.rpi.edu/TFoDS/TFoDS_v5.pdf">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/TFoDS/TFoDS_v5.pdf</a>.  A key conclusion of the report is that &ldquo;<em>theoretical foundations are necessary in all aspects of data science, from the generation and collection of data to the analysis and decision making processes.</em>&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The report further states:</p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"TFoDS will be intrinsically interdisciplinary, in the sense that many different scientific domains will need to work together and develop novel theories that transcend disciplinary boundaries.  Particular emphasis should be placed on interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, since these three disciplines are at the heart of TFoDS."</em></p>
          <p>Recognizing the need to engage these communities and foster collaborations, CCF and DMS are joining together to develop this new program with the goal of promoting long-term, interdisciplinary research and training activities that engage computer scientists, statisticians, and mathematicians in developing the theoretical foundations of data science. </p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p>Phase I of the <em>Transdisciplinary Research In Principles Of Data Science</em> (TRIPODS) program will support the development of small collaborative Institutes that will bring together the three disciplines.  Proposals must address fundamental research and training in the theoretical foundations of data science, and describe the significant involvement of all three communities.</p>
          <p><strong>Program and project structures</strong></p>
          <p>The TRIPODS program is anticipated to consist of two phases, subject to availability of funds.  In Phase I (represented by this solicitation), the program will support approximately eight TRIPODS Institutes for a duration of three years, each at a planned level of up to $500,000 per year.  Approximately two years after Phase I awards are made, a solicitation for Phase II proposals for larger Institutes is anticipated.  Phase II will potentially support a smaller number of Institutes at a significantly higher level of funding for a duration of five years, subject to availability of funds.  Institutes will be encouraged to seek additional support from other sources, such as industrial partners.  In the anticipated Phase II, CCF and DMS may elect to provide partial matching incentives for such additional support (subject to availability of funds).</p>
          <p>Phase I awards are intended to allow teams to develop capacity and demonstrate the ability to scale activities for full Institute operations by operating as smaller Institutes.  While novel approaches are encouraged, it is anticipated that traditional center-like activities will be common, including but not limited to (in no particular order):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>integration of research and education including the definition and development of data science curricula;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>workforce development strategies in the emerging field of data science;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>short- and medium-term collaborative gatherings of leading and early-career scientists;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>longer-term visits;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>participation in research activities by and professional training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; and</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>direction-setting for research agendas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While we anticipate that most or all of these activities (and more) will be included in Phase II Institutes, a Phase I Institute may choose to focus its efforts on a smaller set of activities. Ongoing assessment of an Institute's programs and activities, in preparation for a potential Phase II, will be critical; see "Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions" and "Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria" below.</p>
          <p>Coordination, cooperation, and collaboration among the Institutes during Phase I are encouraged.  We also encourage Institutes to consider coalescing into larger teams for the anticipated Phase II competition, combining complementary strengths exhibited and developed in Phase I.  However, we emphasize that all three of the targeted disciplines must be represented in each Phase I Institute.  Competitive Phase I proposals will comprise teams with at least one PI or co-PI from each targeted discipline.  To be eligible to submit a proposal for a potential Phase II Institute, it is anticipated that at least one PI or co-PI will need to be a PI or co-PI of a funded Phase I Institute. </p>
          <p>We encourage Institutes to leverage existing NSF investments such as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505185">Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5302">Mathematical Sciences Research Institutes</a>, and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503489">Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation</a> as appropriate through collaborations or partnerships.</p>
          <p>Annual PI meetings will be held in the Washington, DC, area to help facilitate the collaboration and cooperation mentioned previously.  At least two team members from each Institute must plan to attend, and proposal budgets must include appropriate amounts for travel to the Washington, DC, area once each year.</p>
          <p><strong>Broad themes of the program</strong></p>
          <p>Proposals for TRIPODS Institutes should demonstrate plans to address the following important factors (drawn in part from the TFoDS Workshop report):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Different communities, such as those that developed business, Internet, and social media applications and those that developed scientific and medical applications, and, indeed, the computer science, statistics, and mathematics communities, have developed different terminology and formalisms for overlapping concepts and methods.  Overcoming these barriers will be crucial for success.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Algorithms developed for theoretical purposes without good knowledge of application domains will typically fail to take into account peculiarities and incompleteness properties of real data, and this failure will limit their impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>While the scientific focus must be on the theoretical foundations, relevance to application domains and industry is important.  Effective communication mechanisms will be required to make these stakeholders aware of what the TRIPODS community can offer, and early engagement with these communities is encouraged.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Data science is already a reality in industrial and scientific enterprises and there is ever-increasing demand from students to get more training in this field.  A remarkable aspect of data science is that many research communities and traditional fields of study identify with the term.  However, each field has different interpretations for this concept.   Unified curricula for data science should be developed in cognizance of this.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>It will be a challenge to fit the necessary foundations from statistics, computer science, and mathematics into a curriculum for data science.  On top of these foundations, experimental validation, ethical behavior, and interdisciplinary communication skills (for communication across the three underlying fields as well as with application domains) will be vital components of curricula. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Data science ranges from experimental design and data collection all the way to data analysis and the final decision-making, i.e., the entire &ldquo;data to knowledge to action&rdquo; pipeline.  Data provenance, reproducibility, privacy, and algorithmic fairness are all fundamental topics that Institutes should actively investigate. These areas are important for foundational research to make impacts beyond academic environments.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Data science is iterative, with a dynamic feedback loop.  Targets can change as more data are acquired; instead of limiting attention to idealized systems under restrictive assumptions, dynamic data collection is general, heterogeneous, and messy.  Many existing tools of mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science are not equipped to handle this aspect of data science problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the factors above, proposers should identify and justify further elements of the foundations of data science that they deem to be critical.</p>
          <p><strong>Sample specific research topics</strong></p>
          <p>Fundamental research areas that may be a part of the focus of a transdisciplinary collaboration under this solicitation include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Combinatorial inference on complex structures;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Tradeoffs between computational costs and statistical efficiency;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Randomized numerical linear algebra;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Representation theory and non-commutative harmonic analysis;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Topological data analysis (TDA) and homological algebra; and</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple areas in machine learning including deep learning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While this list is not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive, proposals must exemplify the roles of the mathematics, theoretical computer science, and statistics communities in laying theoretical foundations for data science, and bring about a true synergy of the best capabilities of all three disciplines.</p>

          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
   
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg"> GPG</a> as Exhibit III-1.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>
        <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14043"><em>Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018</em></a>. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p>
        <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>
         <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>
        <p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>
        <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
          <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
          <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p>
        <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong> during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i. contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal.) Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">GPG</a> Chapter II.C.2.d.i., prior to the review of a proposal.</p>
        <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
          <li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
              <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
          <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
          <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
          <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>
        <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <ol type="a">
      
        <li> Does the proposal describe a well-integrated research and training program focused on the theoretical foundations of data science and fostering collaboration and interaction among the three communities of TRIPODS &ndash; mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science?</li>
       <li> Does the proposal address the &ldquo;broad themes of the program&rdquo; listed in the Program Description?</li>
       <li> Does the proposal address strategies for workforce development, including novel educational and training activities?</li>
       <li> Transdisciplinarity/Synergy: Is the project transdisciplinary, bringing together theories and approaches from theoretical computer science, mathematics, and statistics?  Is there synergy between the different groups?</li>
      <li> Vision: Is there a strong case for the ability to identify and articulate a vision for the foundations of data science?</li>
       <li>Quality and Value of Collaboration: Is the expertise of the PIs complementary and well-suited to the research and training programs developed in this project?  Are the specific roles of each collaborating investigator clear?  Does the collective team have expertise representing the three communities (statistics, mathematics, and theoretical computer science)?</li>
     <li> Is there a well-developed plan for communication and interaction with the domain sciences and industry?</li>
       <li> Does the proposal provide a clear plan and rationale for an investment of the size proposed, including clear plans to develop capacity for potential future Phase II operations?</li>
      <li>Does the Collaboration and Evaluation Plan identify clear measures of success, both for Phase I operations and development of capability for a potential Phase II, along with a plan to evaluate the project with respect to those measures by gathering quantitative and qualitative data?</li>
        <li>Does the Collaboration and Evaluation Plan provide a clear plan for thoughtful, ongoing assessment of all Institute activities? How will the assessment be used to inform and improve both daily Institute operations and long range planning, aiming toward a successful Phase II Institute?</li></ol>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by
        Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
   
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <h4> 
          C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>

          ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

        <p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>, "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
