1040614,NSF,08/26/2010,Charles Cotton,University of Delaware,FIA: Collaborative Research: NEBULA: A Future Internet That Supports Trustworthy Cloud Computing,451922,True,| The NEBULA effort at the University of Delaware has focused on the research and development of software systems components needed to build non-stop High-Availability (HA) router platform infrastructure.  Under this project the a High Availability (HA) registration system, System IS-IS (SIS-IS), was created and the systems performance was contrasted with alternate implementations.  Additionally, several prototypes of a HA forwarding and routing system, HARRS (Highly Available Redundant Routing System), was completed and documented along with initial performance characterizations.  While this effort's goal of creating high availability software systems has made progress exploring the primary use case of building reliable non-stop routing and forwarding systems, it has opened several new areas of investigation.  The effort's secondary goal of self-configuring and self-organizing systems has unique application to the coming ubiquitous deployment of network-connected embedded computing devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT).  Failure to incorporate and enhance these concepts into this future environment will yield complex systems incapable of being controlled or upgraded over their product lifetime and worse, lead to aging connected computers which become ever more susceptible to attack and compromise due to unpatched software flaws.  PRODUCTS  The results of this projects have been disseminated to communities of interest various academic publications, conference proceedings, and talks.  The high-availability technology and techniques for self-organization and self-configuration researched and developed under this effort were shared with both router manufacturers and potential carrier users of this technology.  Products from this grant include a book chapter, six journal, conference papers or other publications and two thesis.

As a planning grant, our major goal is to reduce the risks of a future full proposal. We must insure that research has zero impact on correct operation and end-user privacy. Planning also will promote initial discussions and community building to begin rebuilding this research area.  Outcomes of this work  The project has prototyped a full query measurement infrastructure for a root-server. This prototype demonstrates the viability of measurement collection at Root-server scales, as required in a full research infrastructure for Internet naming. The project has prototyped methods for appropriate data sharing, with different options for flexibility in what is shared. Data sharing will be required in a full research infrastructure for Internet naming; these initial data sharing mechanisms show that sharing is viable. Our initial steps in DNS experimentation help reduce the risk for the experimental component of a full research infrastructure for Internet naming. (Experimentation at the rates of a Root server is a major risk in a full research infrastructure.) The DINR-2016 workshop shows there is significant academic interest in areas of Internet naming, with work at many institutions with topics on measurement, tools, systems design, security (attack and defense), privacy (both general privacy, interactions with protocols such as TOR, and NSEC), and Internet-of-Things.

1346854,NSF,07/23/2013,Petar Djuric,SUNY at Stony Brook,EAGER: RFID Sense-a-Tags for the Internet of Things,159816,True,| The science behind communication by means of reflected signals or backscatter has been studied for several decades. In recent years this technique has seen a widespread practical application in the form of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). It is expected that the RFID technology will play a prominent role in enabling the Internet of Things (IoT), where physical objects will be connected to other objects and to the cyberspace. Typical backscatter RFID systems consist of an active reader that transmits a query signal and passive tags that communicate with the reader by reflecting part of this signal. This communication technique allows for tags that are very inexpensive and consume very low power. Traditional passive RFID has long been thought of as the 'last link' in the IoT, enabling visibility and connectivity for all items regardless of size, cost and volume. This is primarily due to the very low cost and low power consumption of passive RFID tags.  However, use of traditional RFID technology requires a centralized model wherein one high-cost reader initiates and controls communication with a population of tags in it vicinity. This has been a major roadblock to the advancement of the IoT.  An alternative is to design RFID tags that have the capability to communicate with other tags in their proximity without traditional readers. In other words, the basic premise is to develop a system of tags that is based on backscatter tag-to-tag communication. With this system, one can overcome the limitations of traditional RFID systems and help realize the vision of the IoT. It can allow ubiquitously tagged objects to independently communicate with each other without being controlled by a single reader.  In the new systems, passive radio-less tags communicate by reflecting an external excitation signal.  The external exciter does not need to send out modulated commands or decode tag responses. This makes the exciters required for the new system deployment much less expensive than RFID readers. Moreover, the exciters do not need to be networked or synchronized in any way. This minimizes the deployment effort. In many cases, the new system deployments can make use of pre-existing sources of excitation in an application environment such as TV towers and wireless access points. In these cases, the deployment cost and effort for the new system would be almost zero.  In this project we proposed to address the feasibility of designing backscattering devices that can communicate independently and that can become the basic building blocks of the new system. More specifically, we investigated the design of novel tags that have the following functionalities: (a) passive detection and decoding of backscatter signals from RFID tags in their proximity, (b) processing of information that they acquire during their operation, and (c) communication of the collected information by backscattering.  In our work we were able to develop a prototype of a tag that is able to communicate with other tags in its proximity without the presence of a commercial RFID reader. We demonstrated the performance of the tag in a lab environment and showed that in the presence of exciters, tags can readily communicate if they are 1-3 m apart.   We have identified an intrinsic problem of the new system that was rather challenging. Namely due to the nature of the communication, phase cancellation occurs in numerous locations of the tag space. This makes the communication between tags when they are at these locations impossible. However, we analyzed the theory behind the problem and proposed several solutions for overcoming it. We then built tags based on the proposed solutions and demonstrated that these tags did not suffer from phase cancellation.  The merits of the proposed work are in the design of novel tags. We developed theory for their optimization and built their prototypes. We then studied their performance in a laboratory environment.  In the project, we have wo...|
1040735,NSF,08/26/2010,Dipankar Raychaudhuri,Rutgers University New Brunswick,FIA:  Collaborative Research: MobilityFirst: A Robust and Trustworthy Mobility-Centric Architecture for the Future Internet,3339000,True,| The MobilityFirst project started in Sept 2010 as a collaborative, multi-institutional research initiative under the NSF FIA (Future Internet Architecture) program.  The overall goal of the project was to design and validate a clean-slate mobility-centric and trustworthy architecture for the future Internet.  The scope of research included specification of the proposed new network architecture, detailed design and verification of key protocol components, analysis of economic and policy aspects, evaluation of network security and privacy, system-level prototyping and validation of the network as a whole, and "real-world" testbed deployments for evaluation by application developers and end-users.  The project has largely achieved the original goals, producing a full MobilityFirst protocol specification and proof-of-concept implementation centered around the following key concepts: (1) separation of the names of network objects from network addresses; (2) public-key-based GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) for all Internet-attached objects, assigned by multiple independent name certification providers; (3) name (i.e. GUID) based protocol layer as the "narrow waist" of the protocol with support for advanced services such as dynamic mobility, disconnection tolerance, multicast, multi-homing, content retrieval and context-aware message delivery; (4) Global name resolution service (GNS) for dynamic binding of names to network addresses; (5) New inter-domain and intra-domain routing protocols with in-network storage, hop-by-hop transport, edge-awareness and late binding capabilities; (5) Separate management plane instrumented for visibility of network performance and resource usage; and (6) Computing layer for optional in-network service features.   Results from the project include detailed design and evaluation of the above mentioned core protocol components, including the global name service (GNS), the intra- and inter-domain routing (GSTAR and EIR), hop-by-hop transport layer protocol, in-network compute layer and service API.  The global name service has been identified as the critical new component of the architecture, motivating two complementary GNS designs (Auspice at UMass and DMap at Rutgers) and both these alternatives have been successfully prototyped and validated at a reasonably large scale.  The storage-aware routing protocol proposed for MobilityFirst is the other core technology component which has been evaluated in depth during the course of this project, resulting in a baseline intra-domain routing protocol (GSTAR) and two alternative inter-domain routing approaches (EIR and hierarchical routing).  An optional in-network compute layer service has also been developed and validated at the initial proof-of-concept level. A key outcome that has emerged from this effort is a simple but deep architectural insight, namely, that a logically centralized global name service (GNS) can significantly enhance mobility, security, and transform network-layer functionality. In addition to architecture and core protocol design, the team has worked on validating the MobilityFirst protocol stack over a set of representative mobile Internet use cases including: (a) mobile data services over heterogeneous WiFi/cellular networks; (b) content retrieval and delivery to/from both fixed and mobile users; (c) context-aware message delivery services; and (d) machine-to-machine (M2M), sensor network and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications; (e) vehicular networking applications.  These use cases have been mapped to service features in the MobilityFirst protocol stack and are being used as reference models for evaluating protocol performance.  Demonstration systems for some of these use cases have also been built.  In parallel to the above design and analysis activities, the project team engaged in a significant experimental validation and proof-of-concept effort for the MobilityFirst network as a whole.  This effort has led to a series of succ...|

1455794,NSF,08/27/2014,Beichuan Zhang,University of Arizona,EAGER: Collaborative Research: Smart Home Networking via NDN,124994,True,| With the fast growth of smart appliances and smart devices at home, the concept of smart homes has come a long way in recent years. As a result, home networking is transforming from the simplest local area network to one of the most heterogeneous networks supporting intelligent applications that will revolutionize how we live. This emerging smart home environment, however, poses serious challenges to conventional TCP/IP based technologies.      In this EAGER project, we take a fresh look of smart-home networks, and explores novel ways to make them secure, easy-to-use, and efficient. Specifically, we apply Named Data Networking (NDN), an emerging new network architecture, in smart-home networks to fully take advantage of NDN's benefits such as address independence, data security, and in-network caching.      To understand the challenges in current TCP/IP technologies and inform the NDN-Home research, we survey the existing Internet-of-Things (IoT) related standards developed by IETF and summarized the technical challenges encountered at each layer of the network stack.  Some of those challenges stem from the artifact that TCP/IP protocol stack was originally developed for desktop computers and networks that exhibit very different characteristics from the IoT devices, but other challenges are fundamentally caused by the point-to-point communication model of IP, such as the overhead of mesh network routing and TLS/DTLS secured channel setup.  We also identify a recent trend that IoT systems start to converge on a network architecture based on the RESTful communication model with naming, caching, and object security built into the application layer, which essentially realizes a data-centric overlay on top of IP networks.  This observation confirms that NDN is indeed the right approach to smart-homes and IoT networking.       We implement NDN on a number of embedded systems that can be used to build smart-home devices. These systems include Raspberry Pi, Android, home routers, Arduino, a microcontroller, and RIOT, which is a popular operting system used in Internet-of-Things. Based on these platforms, we develop prototypes of home lighting control, home video surveillance systems, and home entertainment systems.      Through these applications and system development, we gained experinece of how to turn smart-home networking into data-centric, and how to adapt to limited computing resources that often exist in this kind of environment. We design mechanisms for device bootstrapping, service discovery, and data access control. In particular, we design a scalable acess control mechanism called "NDN-ACE", which is much more computationally efficient and scalable than the default access control mechanism in NDN.     With these experiences on specific mechanism design and implemenations, we articulate our vision of future smart-home and IoT networking as "Named Data Networking of Things." Using IP and similar protocols as the narrow waist of interoperability for IoT requires managing data exchange and security in terms that are largely orthogonal to application semantics, while simultaneously needing to minimize resource usage. NDN can address the root causes of these challenges and can help achieve the IoT vision in a more secure, straightforward, and innovation-friendly manner. NDN?s data-centric communication model aligns network and application semantics, enabling developers to work with "things" and their data directly, and for IoT networks to be deployed and configured easily. This high-level vision is substantiated by our work in device bootstrapping, service discovery, name-based trust and access contro, data aggregation and publish-subscribe, data dissemination through sync, and easy integration with the global NDN Internet.     There are two major broader impacts. First, this project develops viable, long-term solutions to an emerging network environment that has been recognized by many industry experts. Since there is no mature IP-based solution on the market yet, an NDN-based solution would have significant impacts. Second, in the process of solving an important problem, this area can provide an opportunity for NDN deployment. Unlike in traditional ISP networks, deployment in home networks doesn?t require coordination among networks. The deployment and its benefits are both local to the home users, which may start an grassroots rollout of NDN.                  Last Modified: 02/16/2017       Submitted by: Beichuan Zhang|
1516130,NSF,02/05/2015,David Clark,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Workshop: FIA Investigator Meeting Fall 2014,20935,True,| This award supported one in the series of Future Internet Architecture investigator workshops, held in Fall 2014. This specific workshop had the goal of exploring the larger societal context in which an Internet will sit. The agenda was organized by the Values in Design Council (see http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/vid/vidcouncil.html), an NSF-funded group of people from various of the social sciences. The agenda was organized around four use cases for a future Internet, which were presented by members of the ViD Council, in order to frame a response by each team of FIA grant recipients. The four use cases were   Incidental data / metadata: To what extent can a network architecture support user applications that make its users as impervious to tracking and surveillance from outside parties.  Access and Approval:A startup is producing a fleet of satellites that will  provide daily hi-res photos of every part of the earth's surface. How can they deal with potentially abusive use of the information captured in these photos?  Online Identities: To what extent should a network provide strong tracking of user identity?   Internet of Things:Using tracking of real-time medical data as an example, what sort of network services will facilitate the reliable and trustworthy operation of life-critical sensor systems?   A longer description of each use case and the discussion questions can be found at the Future Internet Architecture Web site: http://www.nets-fia.net/Meetings/Fall14/Agenda. A summary of the meeting can be found at the Values in Design Council web site at https://valuesindesign.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/november-2014-fia-meeting-report.pdf.  Many of these scenarios served to bring out the important distinction between a network as a data transport service and the applications that run on top of that service. Different proposals for an Internet shift functions (such as naming of data or people) from the application to the network layer, and these design choices have important implications for the societal consequences of the design.

1040020,NSF,08/26/2010,William Lehr,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,FIA:  Collaborative Research: MobilityFirst: A Robust and Trustworthy Mobility-Centric Architecture for the Future Internet,250000,True,| The MobilityFirst (MF) project was a multidisciplinary, multi-university networking research project focused on developing a mobility-centric Future Internet Architecture (FIA). The MF-FIA was motivated by the recognition that the rise of mobile services, the Internet of Things, and related industry and market trends called for a new architectural paradigm that would enable more granular and dynamic control of all networking resources (i.e., more dynamic allocation of computing, storage, and transport resources in time, space, and context dimensions). This corresponds to the richer notion of mobility that lies at the heart of the MF-FIA.  In addition to requiring significant technical engineering work, realization of this expanded notion of mobility has potentially profound implications for the Internet industry ecosystem. This includes service providers, equipment makers, application developers, end-users, and policymakers. The MF-FIA will greatly expand the capabilities of Internet-based services, and thereby, help further the ways in which the Internet is inextricably embedded into our socio-economic lives. This further embedding raises the need for integrating social policy and economic considerations into the network design effort.  The focus of the economics and policy research work component of the MF project was to ensure that the MF architecture complied with the MF-FIA team's design principles of (1) Commercializability and (2) Regulability. The first refers to the notion that a good architecture ought to be economically viable. That is, that there exists a reasonable roadmap for deploying the architecture and that it is capable of supporting a reasonable industry structure and business models that have a reasonable prospect of profitability. The second principal seeks to ensure that the architecture is consistent with representative networking social policy goals such as supporting industry competition, innovation, and trustworthy (i.e., secure and privacy preserving) services. While it is impossible to predict the future precisely, these design principles helped the team understand how its technical choices might interact with the larger societal and economic environment in which the MF-FIA is expected to live. This work was on-going during the life of the project and has helped keep the project relevant and focused on real-world challenges.  Two aspects of the MF-FIA are worthy of special mention regarding their potential to impact industry structure and regulatory policies: (1) MF's empowerment of end-users to self-provision and manage their Internet access; and (2) the need to meet the increased demand for wireless spectrum from mobile devices of all sorts. The first of these holds promise in enabling a new vector for "last-mile" competition that could help alleviate concerns over bottleneck facilities that have motivated much of the public concern over Network Neutrality and open Internet access. The second of these requires transitioning to a new paradigm for spectrum management that will enable expanded options for spectrum sharing, and thereby promote greater efficiency in the use of scarce national Radio Frequency resources. The MF-FIA includes capabilities that contribute to each of these goals (e.g., support for multi-homing, scalable deployment of secure networking infrastructure, and naming architecture components that will prove useful in managing spectrum resources).  The economics and policy research work developed further thinking on the future requirements and industry/policy implications of emerging small cell architectures and to support more open models of shared access to spectrum on a more granular and dynamic basis.

1520579,NSF,06/25/2015,Michael Enescu,Energy Adaptive Networks Corporation,SBIR Phase I:  An IoT Gateway for Energy Application,150000,True,| Energy Adaptive Networks (EAN) has successfully completed the development of an IoT gateway for connected energy and other applications based on a NSF SBIR award.  Our vision is to bring adaptive networks technology in the global power grid and local microgrids in order to reduce power loss, minimize blackouts, and make energy accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Our strategy was to develop an IoT gateway for energy applications such as high load or generation devices that can be monitored and controlled via applications developed or enabled by our technology. EAN has successfully implemented an edge network IoT gateway and proceeded to develop software applications that can be provisioned over the Internet such that power grid edge devices can be monitored, controlled, and load balanced in real time, at fast scale, with response times two or three orders of magnitude faster than current power grids allow.  Though our execution in was focused on both northbound (NB) systems, i.e., utility power grids above the last transformer, and southbound (SB), i.e., below the transformer specifically in residential or commercial buildings, consistent customer feedback predicated our primary focus on SB customers. We discovered that our assumptions about home owners, facilities operators, or enterprise campus were correct, our system architecture and deployment assumptions were consistent with the way they expected to install and operate connected energy devices. Consequently, EAN went beyond developing an IoT gateway and proceeded to include it in high load appliances such as electric vehicle (EV) level 2 chargers to be installed and operated by SB customers in local microgrids.  The overall system architecture developed by EAN is summarized in Figure 1. It consists of a three tier architecture: an EAN Cloud where software applications are developed by an ecosystem of commercial and open source software developers, to be deployed at the edge of the network, an EAN IoT Gateway used to host the EAN Cloud hosted applications, and a set of IoT connected devices, such as EV L2 Chargers that can be instrumented to transmit time series data to the EAN Gateway and in turn accept and execute commands that optimize energy consumption, minimizing power loss.  Recent IoT progress showed convincing evidence that customer adoption at the edge of the network (IoT), is 5 times the pace of electricity or telephone adoption.  However, the enablement of the network connectivity necessitates a multitude of wireless protocol standards and implementation already in place: IEEE802.11, IEEE802.15.4, IEEE P1901.2, GPRS, 3G, LTE, and a variety of emerging Low Energy Bluetooth protocols such as Thread, 6loPAN, ZigBee and others. Consequently, we developed the EAN IoT Gateway such that any protocol can be supported by provisioning adapters available for a wide range of connected devices. The EAN IoT Gateway can sense in fast time scale the essential power signals needed to monitor or control. Thus we developed our first prototype and built multiple units installed at various locations in California, Hawaii and Massachusetts. Early data collection from these devices and their location is shown in Figure 2. A typical time series data set is collected with the purpose of observing power signals and detecting anomalies than can be acted upon in sub-second response.  Leveraging the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) research work in Optimal Power Flow (OPF Figure 3), we started with a controller architecture that can be installed and run over networks of multiple local EV chargers controlled via EAN gateways. We discovered that a simpler and more practical problem to solve was the immediate application of a similar approach to EV charges, hence we applied the same methodology to developing an EV charging optimization algorithm now tested in a 40 device mesh on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California as shown in Figure 4.

1418289,NSF,12/13/2013,Damon McCoy,George Mason University,Ideas Lab: Interdisciplinary Pathways towards a Secure Internet,111816,True,| Today, our lives are intimately connected to the Internet. This integration of life and network is ongoing. Indeed, while networks were originally used for computers and their users to communicate, we now have commonplace objects (such as measuring cups, light bulbs and tea kettles) that communicate with each other and with us. This trend is accelerating, leading to what is called the "Internet of Things".  Unfortunately, many networked systems, as well as the networks themselves, are vulnerable to attack or disruption.  Since the late 1980s we have seen attacks that affect thousands (and now 10s or 100s of thousands) of people and cause many millions of dollars in damage.  Over time we have come to realize that the problem of security in our networks and networked systems is a multidisciplinary problem, touching on policy issues, economic incentives, and public and business awareness and education, along with new technical challenges.  In mid-February 2014, the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored a 2 and a half-day workshop centered on identifying high-impact actions that could be taken to better secure the Internet.  The workshop, the Cybersecurity Ideas Lab, brought together 35 invited experts in computer science, cybersecurity, economics, social science and policy.  These experts were drawn from industry, academia, and the government.  The workshop leveraged the NSF Ideas Lab process with a twist.  Where the typical Ideas Lab seeks to identify research ideas or thrusts, this workshop combined expert facilitators with a diverse set of experts to identify actionable ideas that would lead to a more secure Internet. The Ideas Lab was coordinated by a six-member Steering Committee.  The workshop participants generated a large number of ideas for high-impact actions that could potentially be adopted by cybersecurity researchers, policymakers or practitioners to advance cybersecurity. The workshop refined, combined and adapted these ideas to yield a practical working set of recommendations. The Steering Committee assembled and, through multiple review cycles, refined the ideas into the sixteen actionable recommendations presented below. These recommendations are grouped into three categories: technology, policy, and leadership. (We note that educational opportunities also regularly appear within individual recommendations.) This workshop report was compiled and edited by Emily Grumbling, Keith Marzullo and Craig Partridge, with additional input from the Steering Committee.  We present these recommendations in three categories: technology, policy, and leadership. Technology recommendations include ideas for research, development, deployment and modification of cyberattack prevention and response tools. Policy recommendations require action by the Federal Government in the form of new laws or regulations, standards, governance or coordination models. Leadership pathways invite the Federal Government to leverage its existing leadership in information technology to improve cybersecurity practices, both inside and outside the government. A theme of education and awareness appears throughout these three categories, including ways of informing user practices and raising awareness of the impact of breaches.  The recommendations are diverse, spanning a range of challenges, mechanisms and themes. They address various timeframes with respect to a cyber incident, including preventative or preemptive measures, tools for system maintenance and incident response and post-incident evaluation and reporting. Some aim to convene experts and gather or advance knowledge of risks. Others propose the development of new standards, laws or regulations, new education and research initiatives, or deployment of specific tools and technologies.  Some recommendations are cautionary and invite us to better understand the consequences of the choices we may make.  Most envision the Federal Government playing a key role, as a technology leader, a policy ...|
1623931,NSF,03/01/2016,Florence Hudson,INTERNET2,End-to-End Trust and Security for the Internet of Things Workshop,10000,True,| This grant provided travel support for researchers and graduate students who otherwise would not have the ability to attend the "End to End Trust and Security Workshop for the Internet of Things" which was jointly sponsored by the IEEE, Internet2 and the National Science Foundation on February 4, 2016 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The workshop brought together researchers, academics, government agencies, industry and standards bodies for panels, presentations and breakout discussions around the unsolved research and operational challenges in developing a security framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). Participants included researchers, students, IT architects, security professionals, industry leaders and government employees. The workshop focused on challenges and solutions involved with End-to-End trust and security for an open IoT architectural framework, addressing key TIPPSS elements: Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety and Security.  It was part of Internet2?s larger program to foster collaborative innovation in several key areas, including IoT and End-to-end Trust and Security. The event enabled discussion of potential technology solutions, policy implications, best practices and gaps related to the challenges in End-to-End trust and security for IoT.  Prior to this workshop, activities had been held at campus, industry-specific, domain-specific, and technology or device levels addressing ways to enhance trust and security on intra- and inter-campus and organizational levels, as well as isolated discipline-specific inquiries into the Internet of Things. There had been few opportunities to link together these isolated activities, or convene people active in these investigations, thereby limiting any impact or possibility of translating a model from one discipline or setting to another or across the broader IoT solutions ecosystem.  The workshop provided this opportunity, while building upon existing momentum and enabling translation of findings into community practice for a variety of settings and disciplines. The workshop agenda included discussion on: Needs and Challenges in End-to-End Trust, Security, and Privacy for the IoT; E2E Trust and Security Using ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 (Sensei-IOT) 1st Semantic Web 3.0 Standard for the Internet of Things (IOT); Industrial Internet Reference Architecture; Network End-to-End Data Link Evaluation System (Needles); Outcomes of the 2015 Internet of Things Security and Privacy Keynote Workshop; The Internet of Things: An Overview: Understanding the Issue and Challenges of a More Connected World; IOT and the Ability to Defend Against the Silent Intruder; and Wi-Fi Privacy Experiments at IEEE 802 &amp; IETF meetings. It also included breakout groups addressing Access Control and Identity Management, Architectural Framework, Policy and Standards, and Scenarios and Use Cases.  The meeting included 181 attendees representing 153 institutions from 7 countries (United States, Canada, China, India, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and Singapore) including 54 universities, 16 government agencies, 74 corporations, plus 9 professional organizations and national research and education networks. The workshop resulted in the following insights: 1) Policy moves slowly and in response to interest groups and positions while products are being created more and more quickly; 2) Developers need to know they have responsibility for privacy, security, and trust; 3) Different industries need to work toward common goals within different regulatory frameworks and with different governmental bodies; 4) Makers have to be educated as to privacy/security needs without impeding innovation; 5) We need to explore how security, privacy, and IoT ethics can be built into systems and developer tools and education; and 6) Technologists need to lead creation of definitions while reflecting local cultures and legal systems. By leveraging Internet2?s successful, long-term track record of coordinating meetings for and by the community, the results of the workshop can inform ongoing government-funded research initiatives by NSF and other agencies in multiple disciplines. By convening members of the community for this interactive opportunity and benefiting from incremental interaction with IEEE members that this workshop allowed, this gathering continued the momentum of Internet2?s Internet of Things and End to End Trust and Security innovation initiatives, thereby increasing its likelihood of enhancing the work of current and future NSF-funded researchers in multiple disciplines in multiple campuses.

0844890,NSF,03/13/2009,Dongjun Lee,University of Tennessee Knoxville,CAREER: Passivity-Based Distributed Frameworks for Multiuser Shared Haptic Collaboration over the Internet,455889,True,| The Internet continues to expand into our lives everyday, from incredible fact finding tools to social communications with other people all over the world.  Now the Internet of Things is becoming a new reality where human Internet interactions may involve more than just information exchange.  This research is about the ingredients that would go into a new form of Internet interaction where multiple users could experience and share haptic (touch/feel) interactions with a common object of interest.  Such interaction fundamentally requires dynamic and bilateral data exchange between all of the participants that is physically consistent with the haptic response properties (shape, surface texture, softness, etc.) of the common object &ndash; what any one person "feels" is dependent on the physcial interactions provided by the other persons.  It is envisioned that this type of Internet-based haptics collaboration would open new opportunites for international and national collaboration in medicine, science, and engineering in research, development, and training.  In addition to the complexities of dynamic force interaction, operation over the Internet introduces other challenges resulting from the time delays associated with sending signals from one physical location to another through the myriad of cables and transmitters around the world.  These delays can be on the order of seconds.  The communications networks that form the Internet occaisionally are not able to transmit data due to information traffic flow log jams and hardware faults, resulting in random information exchange dropout periods.  A major focus of this research has been the development of signal processing and control schemes that can allow the proposed haptic collaboration in the face of these Internet complexities with acceptable levels of performance, stability and reliability.  There are two theoretical aspects of this research that have resulted in fundamentally new ideas, the "passive set position modulation (PSPM) framework" and the a "consensus based peer-to-peer control architecture."  The passive set position modulation framework add to the tools necessary to achieve stable operations and was tested and verified in a simplified experiment.  The peer-to-peer architechture provides one approach to acheiving a multi-user haptic collaboration.  Experiments with the peer-to-peer control architecture verified the general feasibility of the approach.  These contributions are important steps toward multi-user haptic collaboration over the Internet, but many challenges remain for future work to address.    A novel passivity controller based on PSPM,  was implemented on a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) whole arm manipulator (WAM) based master/slave system to study how well this particular passivity approach would work with an actual mulit-degree of freedom teleoperator. The WAM is operated remotely from a controller comprised of four Phantom Omni haptic feedback devices.   See Figure 2. The experiments conducted were based on standardized manipulation experiments performed by Dr. William Ferrell in his work with a time delayed 2 DOF robot. Remote tasks involved handling five blocks of various, calculated sizes to linearly increase the difficulty of grabbing a block.  During the experiments, two types of data were collected to observe the effect of the PSPM on robot performance: the total amount of time required to perform the task and a qualitative response from the subject describing the difference they experienced between the PSPM controller and standard position controller. The subjects did not know which controller was being used and the order in which the controllers were presented was changed before each test.               Due to time constraints, only two subjects were fully tested. For the majority of blocks, the PSPM controller performed better than the standard position controller. There are several data points for which this is not true, particularly for the more difficult blocks, and more frequently with increased latency.  An attempt was made to test subjects with 0.8s of latency, but our teleoperator test bed's real-time computational introduced mitigating instabilities.               The qualitative data collected includes statements from each subject about the behavior of the teleoperator under each controller and each subject?s controller preference for each block and the amount of time delay. This qualitative data showed that despite the completion time for the PSPM controller being sometimes slower than the standard position controller, the PSPM controller is generally the preferred control scheme for all time delay magnitudes. The typical responses as to why the PSPM controller was preferred referenced an increase in the smoothness of operation as well as an increase in the speed of system response.             Through the experiments designed by Ferrell, the Passive Set-Position Modulation controller set forth the Lee and Huang does in fact increase the stability and responsiveness of a time delayed 6 DOF teleoperator.   We believe future research in the realm of force-feedback full-scale 6 DOF teleoperators using PSPM would be beneficial in understanding its full capabilities.

1413817,NSF,12/06/2013,David Clark,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Workshop:FIA investigator meeting fall 2013,10997,True,| This award supported one in a series of workshops for investigators funded under the NSF Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program. This program challenges the network research community to envision what an Internet of 15 years from now might be, and consider architectural alternatives to the current Internet.     This meeting addressed four topics: fault management, routing, Internet of things, and performance.     The issue of fault management is important because one of the problems with the current Internet is that while certain obvious faults, such as a failed router, can be detected by its neighbors and potentially corrected by the dynamic routing algorithms if there is adequate redundancy, there is no general way to detect or localize more complex or malicious failures. This limitation leaves both users and network operators confounded when things go wrong, and opens the door to a range of security problems. The alternatives being explored within the FIA program display a range of approaches to fault management; some rely on a very expressive packet header to provide detailed route control, others rely on a very constrained packet header but per-packet state in the routers. Either of these approaches might lead to an improved ability to deal with faults in the current Internet.     The question of routing is not the complete details of how the schemes are currently doing routing, but what the different designs provide as foundations for routing, and what they require from a routing protocol. Mobility is a challenge for the current Internet, and content delivery is handled today using delivery "overlays" that are only loosely coupled to the Internet forwarding scheme. Better integration of these issues into the fabric of the Internet might lead to improved performance, functionality and security.     The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a future where "everything" is network-enabled in some form. Small devices (sensors and actuators) raise issues of scale, power, security, management and the like.  Several of the projects address one or another aspect of the IoT vision. Overall, the landscape of IoT is not yet fully mapped, and there is probably no single architecture for IoT that will prevail. . However, there was a strong suggestion that the issues will not be centered on the data plane and packet forwarding, but on issues of configuration, security, power management and the like.     Most of the FIA proposals do not distinguish themselves from the current Internet on the basis of simple performance improvements (e.g., efficient use of links). However, the different schemes raise different and interesting questions about aspects of performance. Each of the funded projects discussed the key performance challenges raised by their proposals, and described research they are doing to address possible barriers to deployment of their schemes. Some of these mechanisms, if successful, might be of great benefit to the current Internet.       Last Modified: 04/13/2015       Submitted by: David D Clark|

Our method to this end was customer discovery through conducting interviews with several tens of potential customers for our technology.  Through the iCorps program, the Principal Investigator, the Entrepreneurial Lead, and the Industry mentor spent the summer of 2016 conducting more than 160 interviews with customers across the US. As a consequence of these interviews and feedback sessions with the iCorps instructors, a business model canvas was created that reflected our hypothesis on key aspects of the business (e.g., customer, value proposition, income model, resources, etc.)  These interviews validated the team's hypothesis that IoT security is indeed an emerging market and confirmed that customers across various market verticals (e.g., hospitality, manufacturing, and the automotive industry) have already started searching for IoT solutions with little success. That said, the team also discovered a crucial missing piece in the technical solution, namely the actual development of attack detection and prevention algorithms for IoT.  Based on the insights and lessons learned from the experience, the team ultimately decided not to proceed with launcing a commercial endeavor at this time. However, the team gained valuable lessons in how to validate novel ideas with respect to eventual beneficiaries (i.e., customers) as well as more focused exploration in the program domain for future efforts.

1548298,NSF,11/20/2015,Craig Green,|Carbice Nanotechnologies, Inc.|,SBIR Phase I:  A Novel Heat Dissipation Product for Chip Testing and Internet of Things,179175,True,| Nature of the Project  Like many technologies, semiconductors exhibit a bathtub shaped failure history. Devices that survive this infant mortality period have a high likelihood of remaining functional until their expected end of lifetime, when the failure rate again rises.  To avoid shipping defective units to end users, semiconductor manufacturers attempt to induce eventual failure during an accelerated infant mortality period, through device stress testing. In burn in testing, chips are exercised at elevated temperatures, taking advantage of the inverse relationship between reliability and operating temperature.  The elevated temperatures allow eventual failures to be induced more rapidly, minimizing the time required for in house testing. In addition to burn in, many devices also undergo additional functional stress tests where they are operated at or beyond their expected functional limits to ensure that they will perform as expected in the field.  Because the devices are being exercised at their performance limits during testing, an effective thermal solution is a must. However, the temporary nature of the testing environment (after testing the chips must be packaged as new components with no signs of the testing they have undergone) places unique demands on the thermal interface material that mates with the die. Those requirements result in a landscape of chip testing TIMs that can only offer compromises. Indium, a common TIM used for chip testing, can offer the required low thermal resistances, but also has limited durability that results in frequent costly replacements. Graphite or rubber based TIMs offer a bit more durability, but their low cross plane conductivity and relatively poor surface compliance does not deliver the desired thermal resistances. Outcomes  In Phase 1 Carbice developed a set of polymer-carbon nanotube (CNT) composite TIMs targeted at addressing the significant thermal-mechanical challenges found in the chip burn in and test market. For the chip testing market, with its short test cycles resulting in sometimes hundreds or even thousands of chip insertions per day, we have introduced Carbice infinityTM. Carbice infinityTM is a premium product so named because despite intensive testing in our facilities, the TIM never failed due to thermal or mechanical wear. For the burn in market Carbice duraTM is offered at a lower price point. Carbice duraTM offers lower overall thermal resistances, it is not intended to last the many thousands of test cycles that Carbice infinityTM offers. This is well suited to the burn in market where each test cycle can last several hours, resulting in a required number of insertions per year that is orders of magnitude below that found in chip functional testing.  Several industry leaders displayed significant interest in testing our product, and we were able to establish testing, and later supplier relationships with many of these companies. Our customers? existing solutions last on average about a week of continuous testing in their production environment. Installed in early 2016, Carbice infinityTM achieved over six months of sustained performance in a customer application, representing several thousand thermal mechanical test cycles.  In another example application, Carbice provided Carbice infinityTM to a test equipment manufacturer for a three stage test where it was compared side by side with two other potential candidates for use in mobile chip testing.  In the first stage of the test, six Carbice infinityTM samples were installed on a prototype 18 head test handler and its thermal performance was compared side by side with two other candidate TIMs. This first test occurred at the customer?s R&amp;D facility with real devices in a functional test. Carbice infinityTM emerged from the first stage of testing as the best candidate and proceeded to the second stage of testing where its durability was tested at the test equipment manufacturer facility on a test handler with simulated test die. In this second stage of testing, Carbice infinityTM survived 5,000 mechanical test cycles with no visible signs of wear, far exceeding the customer?s expectations. In the final stage of testing, Carbice infinityTM was sent to the customer?s production facility for an extended duration functional test. This third stage of testing is ongoing.  The Carbice solution for electronic test equipment has had excellent success both technically and commercially in Phase 1. This solution has been tested against industry standard materials in over 5,000 thermo-mechanical test cycles and has proven to provide performance advantages in terms of lower thermal resistance and increased performance stability over the test cycles.  This performance advantage allows devices to be tested faster, and increases the number of devices that can be tested before the TIM must be replaced, which provides a tremendous reduction in operation costs and provides a more profitable cost structure across the entire business for chip manufacturers.  Carbice infinityTM and duraTM have been manufactured reproducibly in low quantities and has demonstrated over 30% lower resistance than incumbent solutions in customer test and burn-in applications.

The main goal of the workshop was to gather an international forum on recent developments in theoretical and applied aspects of the field of security and privacy issues for the Internet of Things and to initiate collaborative research.  The project outcome is summarized in two areas in which the first one addresses technical findings and collaborative efforts developed as a result and the second one addresses broader impacts of this project.  The workshop found that Internet of Things (IoT) has internationally gained great attention in recent years and attracted research/development efforts  from academia, industries, and governments. There were four technical sessions comprising of 12 presentations: (1) Authentications and Challenges in IoT (2) IoT Privacy Research and Policy, (3) IoT Security Framework, and (4) IoT Security: Case Reports and Research Directions in Korea. Speakers were from academia, industries, and Korean government. Each presentation had follow-up discussions. Researchers on both sides found that these topics are fruitful for further collaborations. Three collaborative research proposals were developed and submitted for funding among workshop participants. Additional collaborative proposals between US and Korea researchers are currently under discussions. The interactions among the workshop participants at the U.S. and Korea sides have been truly substantial.  The workshop had educational impacts. Two undergraduate students from GWU who  have participated in the workshop are now engaged in undergraduate research in the area and  planning to pursue graduate programs. The workshop also had major societal impacts as IoT security directly relates to privacy of everyone. The discussions at the workshop can provide guidelines for future standards and technologies for practical solutions for  security and privacy in IoT.  Through international University-industry collaborations, there will be ample opportunities to apply basic research findings to practical problems that may open up a technology transfer opportunity.
